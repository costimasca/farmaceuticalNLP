For patients with moderate to moderately severe chronic pain not requiring rapid onset of analgesic effect, the tolerability of ULTRAM® can be improved by initiating therapy with the following titration regimen: ULTRAM® should be started at 25 mg/day (half ULTRAM® scored tablet) qAM and titrated in 25 mg increments as separate doses every 3 days to reach 100 mg/day (25 mg q.i.d.).
