The initial dose of RIXUBIS is calculated based on the empirical finding that one international unit of RIXUBIS per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX by 0.7 international units/dL of plasma (0.7% of normal) for patients  < 12 years of age and by 0.9 international units/dL of plasma (0.9% of normal) in patients  ≥ 12 years of age.
A guide for calculating the initial dose of RIXUBIS for treatment of bleeding episodes is as follows:
Initial Dose = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (% of normal or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed recovery (IU/kg per IU/dL) 
Base the calculation of the dose on the patient's individual incremental recovery using serial factor IX activity assays, due to the wide range of inter-individual differences in incremental recovery. Titrate the dose based on the patient's clinical response and individual pharmacokinetics, in particular incremental recovery and half-life.
On average, a 22% lower recovery has been observed in pediatric patients ( < 12 years, n=23). For an incremental recovery of 0.7 international units/dL of plasma (0.7% of normal), the dose is calculated as follows:
Dose (international units) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (% of normal or IU/dL) x 1.4 dL/kg 
Example (assuming patient's baseline factor IX level is  < 1% of normal)
1. A dose of 1500 international units of RIXUBIS, administered to a 20 kg patient should be expect to result in a peak post-infusion factor IX increase of 1500 international units x {[0.7 IU/dL]/[IU/kg}/[20 kg] = 53.6 international units/dL (53.6% of normal).
For an incremental recovery of 0.9 international units/dL of plasma (0.9% of normal), the dose is calculated as follows:
Dose (international units) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (% of normal or IU/dL) x 1.1 dL/kg 
Examples (assuming patient's baseline factor IX level is  < 1% of normal):
A guide for dosing RIXUBIS in the control and prevention of bleeding episodes and perioperative management is provided in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Ensure the factor IX activity level is achieved and maintained in the corresponding period.

Table 2 : Dosing for Perioperative Management  
The dose for previously treated patients (PTPs) is 60 to 80 international units per kg twice weekly for patients  < 12 years of age and is 40 to 60 international units per kg twice weekly for patients  ≥ 12 years of age. Adjust the dose based on the individual patient's age, bleeding pattern, and physical activity.
The procedures below are provided as general guidelines for the preparation and reconstitution of RIXUBIS. Always work on a clean surface and wash hands before performing the following procedures:
