The duration of treatment will vary with the type of lesion and may extend    from a few days to several weeks, according to therapeutic response.
Instill one or two drops of Ophthalmic Solution NEODECADRON (neomycin and dexamethasone)  into the conjunctival    sac every hour during the day and every two hours during the night as initial    therapy. When a favorable response is observed, reduce dosage to one drop every    four hours. Later, further reduction in dosage to one drop three or four times    daily may suffice to control symptoms.
Not more than 20 milliliters should be prescribed initially and the prescription    should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in PRECAUTIONS    above.
