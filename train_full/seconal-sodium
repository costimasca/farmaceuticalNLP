Dosages of barbiturates must be individualized with full knowledge of their particular characteristics. Factors of consideration are the patient's age, weight, and condition.
Adults - As a hypnotic, 100 mg at bedtime. Preoperatively, 200 to 300    mg 1 to 2 hours before surgery.
Pediatric Patients - Preoperatively, 2 to 6 mg/kg, with a maximum dosage    of 100 mg.
Special patient population - Dosage should be reduced in the elderly    or debilitated because these patients may be more sensitive to barbiturates.    Dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function or hepatic    disease.
