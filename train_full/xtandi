The recommended dose of XTANDI is 160 mg (four 40 mg capsules) administered orally once daily. XTANDI can be taken with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Swallow capsules whole. Do not chew, dissolve, or open the capsules.
If a patient experiences a  ≥  Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable side effect, withhold dosing for one week or until symptoms improve to  ≤  Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg), if warranted.
The concomitant use of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided if possible. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, reduce the XTANDI dose to 80 mg once daily. If co-administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the XTANDI dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided if possible. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, increase the XTANDI dose from 160 mg to 240 mg once daily. If co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the XTANDI dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
