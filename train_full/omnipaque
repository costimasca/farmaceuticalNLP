The volume and concentration of OMNIPAQUE 180, OMNIPAQUE   240, or OMNIPAQUE 300 to be administered will depend on the degree and extent   of contrast required in the area(s) under examination and on the equipment and technique employed.
OMNIPAQUE 180 at a concentration of 180 mgI/mL, OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL, or OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is recommended for the examination of the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions in adults by lumbar or direct cervical injection and is slightly hypertonic to CSF.
OMNIPAQUE 180 at a concentration of 180 mgI/mL is recommended for the examination of the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions in children by lumbar injection and is slightly hypertonic to CSF.
A total dose of 3060 mg iodine or a concentration of 300 mgI/mL should not be exceeded in adults and a total dose of 2700 mg iodine or a concentration of 180 mgI/mL should not be exceeded in children in a single myelographic examination. This is based on clinical trial evaluation to date. As in all diagnostic procedures, the minimum volume and dose to produce adequate visualization should be used. Most procedures do not require either maximum dose or concentration.
Anesthesia is not necessary. Premedication sedatives or tranquilizers are usually not needed (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be well hydrated prior to and following contrast administration. Seizure-prone  patients should be maintained on anticonvulsant medication. Many radiopaque  contrast agents are incompatible in vitro with some antihistamines and many other drugs; therefore, concurrent drugs should not be physically admixed with contrast agents.
To avoid excessive mixing with CSF and consequent dilution of contrast, injection should be made slowly over 1 to 2 minutes.
Depending on the estimated volume of contrast medium which may be required for the procedure a small amount of CSF may be removed to minimize distention of the subarachnoid spaces.
The lumbar or cervical puncture needle may be removed immediately following injection since it is not necessary to remove OMNIPAQUE after injection into the subarachnoid space.
The usual recommended total doses for use in lumbar, thoracic, cervical, and total columnar myelography in adults are 1.2 gI to 3.06 gI as follows:
 
The usual recommended total doses for lumbar, thoracic, cervical, and/or total columnar myelography by lumbar puncture in children are 0.36 gI to 2.7 gI (see table below). Actual volumes administered depend largely on patient age and the following guidelines are recommended.
 
Withdrawal of contrast agents from their containers should be accomplished under aseptic conditions with sterile syringes. Spinal puncture must always be performed under sterile conditions.
Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration. If particulate matter or discoloration is present, do not use.
If in the clinical judgment of the physician sequential or repeat examinations are required, a suitable interval of time between administrations should be observed to allow for normal clearance of the drug from the body. An interval of at least 48 hours should be allowed before repeat examination; however, whenever possible, 5 to 7 days is recommended.
Good patient management should be exercised at all times to minimize the potential for procedurally related complications.
Recent evidence with nonionic, water-soluble contrast media suggests that maintaining the patient postmyelography in an upright position (via wheelchair or ambulation) may help minimize adverse effects. The upright position may help to delay upward dispersion of the medium and to maximize the spinal arachnoid absorption.
As with all radiopaque contrast agents, the lowest dose of OMNIPAQUE necessary to obtain adequate visualization should be used. A lower dose may reduce the possibility of an adverse reaction. Most procedures do not require use of either the maximum volume or the highest concentration of OMNIPAQUE. The combination of volume and concentration of OMNIPAQUE to be used should be carefully individualized accounting for factors such as age, body weight, size of the vessel and the rate of blood flow within the vessel. Other factors such as anticipated pathology, degree and extent of opacification required, structure(s) or area to be examined, disease processes affecting the patient, and equipment and technique to be employed should be considered.
Sterile technique must be used in all vascular injections involving contrast media.
Withdrawal of contrast agents from their containers should be accomplished under aseptic conditions with sterile equipment. Sterile techniques must be used with any invasive procedure. If nondisposable equipment is used, scrupulous care should be taken to prevent residual contamination with traces of cleansing agents.
It may be desirable that solutions of radiopaque diagnostic agents be used at body temperature when injected.
Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Solutions of OMNIPAQUE should be used only if clear and within the normal colorless to pale yellow range. If particulate matter or discoloration is present, do not use.
Angiocardiography
Pharmacology - Hemodynamic Changes
OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for angiocardiography (ventriculography, aortic root injections, and selective coronary arteriography).
OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated in children for angiocardiography (ventriculography, pulmonary arteriography, and venography, and studies of the collateral arteries).
OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is indicated in children for angiocardiography (ventriculography).
After both ventricular and coronary injection, decreases in systolic pressure were less pronounced and returned to baseline values earlier with OMNIPAQUE 350 than with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.
OMNIPAQUE 350 produced less Q-T interval prolongation than seen with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.
In children, after injection of all sites, but particularly following ventricular and pulmonary artery injections, decreases in both systolic and diastolic intravascular pressure were significantly less pronounced with OMNIPAQUE 350 than with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.
In children, OMNIPAQUE 350 produced significantly less shortening of the R-R interval than seen with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium injection.
If repeat injections are made in rapid succession, all these changes are likely to be more pronounced.
Precautions
During administration of large doses of OMNIPAQUE 350, continuous monitoring of vital signs is desirable. Caution is advised in the administration of large volumes to patients with incipient heart failure  because of the possibility of aggravating the preexisting condition.  Hypotension should be corrected promptly since it may induce serious arrhythmias.
Special care regarding dosage should be observed in patients with right ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, or stenotic  pulmonary vascular beds because of the hemodynamic changes which may occur after injection into the right heart outflow tract. (See PRECAUTIONS - General.)
Pediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.
Adverse Reactions
Cardiovascular system reactions in angiocardiography included angina (8%), hypotension (2.5%), bradycardia (1.0%), and tachycardia  (1.0%). (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular - General.)
Dosage and Administration
The individual dose or volume is determined by the size of the structure to be visualized, the anticipated degree of hemodilution, and valvular competence. Weight is a minor consideration in adults, but must be considered in infants and young children. The volume of each individual injection is a more important consideration than the total dosage used. When large individual volumes are administered, as in ventriculography and aortography, it has been suggested that several minutes be permitted to elapse between each injection to allow for subsidence of possible hemodynamic disturbances.
The recommended single injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for angiocardiographic procedures in adults and the recommended single injection volumes of OMNIPAQUE 350 and OMNIPAQUE 300 for angiographic procedures in children are as follows:
Adults: The usual adult volume for a single injection is 40 mL with a range of 30 mL to 60 mL. This may be repeated as necessary. When combined with selective coronary arteriography, the total administered volume should not exceed 250 mL (87.5 gI).
Pediatrics: The usual single injection dose of OMNIPAQUE 350 is 1.25 mL/kg of body weight with a range of 1.0 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. For OMNIPAQUE 300 the usual single injection dose is 1.75 mL/kg with a range of 1.5 mL/kg to 2.0 mL/kg. When multiple injections are given, the total administered dose should not exceed 5 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.
The usual adult volume for right or left coronary arteriography is 5 mL (range 3 mL to 14 mL) per injection.
The usual adult single injection volume is 50 mL, with a range of 20 mL to 75 mL.
Pediatrics: The usual single injection dose is 1.0 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350.
Multiple Procedures
Adults: The visualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.
Large doses of OMNIPAQUE 350 were well tolerated in angiographic procedures requiring multiple injections.
The maximum total volume for multiple procedures should not exceed 250 mL of 350 mgI/Ml (87.5 gI).
Pediatrics: Visualization of multiple vascular systems and target organs is possible during a single radiographic examination of the patient.
The maximum total dose for multiple injection procedures should not exceed 5.0 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 or 6.0 mL/kg up to a total volume of 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300.
OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL and OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL are indicated in adults for use in aortography and selective visceral arteriography including studies of the aortic arch, ascending aorta, and abdominal aorta and its branches (celiac, mesenteric, renal, hepatic and splenic arteries).
OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated in children for use in aortography including studies of the aortic root, aortic arch, ascending and descending aorta.
Precautions
Under conditions of slowed aortic circulation there is an increased likelihood for aortography to cause muscle spasm. Occasional serious neurologic complications, including paraplegia, have also been reported in patients with aortoiliac obstruction, femoral artery obstruction, abdominal compression, hypotension, hypertension, spinal anesthesia, and injection of vasopressors to increase contrast. In these patients the concentration, volume and number of repeat injections of the medium should be maintained at a minimum with appropriate intervals between injections. The position of the patient and catheter tip should be carefully monitored.
Entry of a large aortic dose into the renal artery may cause, even in the absence of symptoms, albuminuria, hematuria, and an elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen. Rapid and complete return of function usually follows. (See PRECAUTIONS - General.)
Adverse Reactions
See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular - General, and ADVERSE REACTIONS - Angiocardiography.
Dosage and Administration
Adults: The usual adult volume as a single injection is 50 mL to 80 mL for the aorta, 30 mL to 60 mL for major branches including celiac and mesenteric arteries, and 5 mL to 15 mL for renal arteries. Repeated injections may be performed if indicated, but the total volume should not exceed 291 mL of OMNIPAQUE 300 or 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350 (87.5 gI).
Pediatrics: The usual single injection dose is 1.0 mL/kg of OMNIPAQUE 350 and should not exceed 5.0 mL/kg up to a total volume of 250 mL of OMNIPAQUE 350.
OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for use in cerebral arteriography.
The degree of pain and flushing as the result of the use of OMNIPAQUE 300 in cerebral arteriography is less than that seen with comparable injections of many contrast media. In cerebral arteriography, patients should be appropriately prepared consistent with existing or suspected disease states.
Precautions
Cerebral arteriography should be undertaken with extreme care with special caution in elderly patients, patients in poor clinical condition, advanced arteriosclerosis, severe arterial hypertension, recent cerebral embolism or thrombosis, and cardiac decompensation. Since the contrast medium is given by rapid injection, the patient should be monitored for possible untoward reactions. (See PRECAUTIONS - General.)
Adverse Reactions
Cerebral arteriography with water-soluble contrast media has been associated with temporary neurologic complications including seizures, drowsiness, transient paresis, and mild disturbances in vision such as photomas of 1-second or less duration.
Central nervous system reactions in cerebral arteriography included photomas (15%), headache (5.5%), and pain (4.5%). (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular - General.)
Dosage and Administration
OMNIPAQUE 300 is recommended for cerebral arteriography at the following volumes: common carotid artery (6 mL to 12 mL), internal  carotid artery (8 mL to 10 mL), external carotid artery (6 mL to 9 mL), and  vertebral artery (6 mL to 10 mL).
OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL, OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL, and OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL are indicated in adults for use in intravenous contrast enhanced computed tomographic head and body imaging by rapid injection or infusion technique.
OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL and OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL are indicated in children for use in intravenous contrast enhanced computed tomographic head imaging by rapid bolus injection.
OMNIPAQUE may be used to redefine diagnostic precision in areas of the brain which may not otherwise have been satisfactorily visualized.
OMNIPAQUE may be useful to investigate the presence and extent of certain malignancies such as: gliomas including malignant gliomas, glioblastomas, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and gangliomas, ependymomas, medulloblastomas, meningiomas, neuromas, pinealomas, pituitary adenomas, carniopharyngiomas, germinomas, and metastatic lesions. The usefulness of contrast enhancement for the investigation of the retrobulbar space and in cases of low grade or infiltrative glioma has not been demonstrated. In calcified lesions, there is less likelihood of enhancement. Following therapy, tumors may show decreased or no enhancement. The opacification of the inferior  vermis following contrast media administration has resulted in falsepositive diagnosis in a number of otherwise normal studies.
OMNIPAQUE may be beneficial in the image enhancement of nonneoplastic lesions. Cerebral infarctions of recent onset may be better visualized with contrast enhancement, while some infarctions are obscured if contrast medium is used. The use of iodinated contrast media results in enhancement in about 60 percent of cerebral infarctions studied from one to four weeks from the onset of symptoms.
Sites of active infection may also be enhanced following contrast medium administration. Arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms will show contrast enhancement. For these vascular lesions the enhancement is probably dependent on the iodine content of the circulating blood pool. Hematomas and intraparenchymal bleeders seldom demonstrate contrast enhancement. However, in cases of intraparenchymal clot, for which there is no obvious clinical explanation, contrast media administration may be helpful in ruling out the possibility of associated arteriovenous malformation.
OMNIPAQUE may be useful for enhancement of computed tomographic images for detection and evaluation of lesions in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, aorta, mediastinum, pelvis, abdominal cavity, and retroperitoneal space.
Enhancement of computed tomography with OMNIPAQUE may be of benefit in establishing diagnoses of certain lesions in these sites with greater assurance than is possible with CT alone. In other cases, the contrast agent may allow visualization of lesions not seen with CT alone (ie, tumor  extension) or may help to define suspicious lesions seen with unenhanced CT (ie, pancreatic cyst).
For information regarding the use of dilute oral plus intravenous OMNIPAQUE in CT of the abdomen, see Individual Indications And Usage - Oral Use.
Precautions
See PRECAUTIONS - General.
Adverse Reactions
Immediately following intravascular injection of contrast medium, a transient sensation of mild warmth is not unusual. Warmth is less frequent with OMNIPAQUE than with ionic media. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular - General.)
Dosage and Administration
The concentration and volume required will depend on the equipment and imaging technique used.
The dosage recommended for use in adults for contrast enhanced computed tomography is as follows:
 
The dosage recommended for use in children for contrast enhanced computed tomographic head imaging is 1.0 mL/kg to 2.0 mL/kg for OMNIPAQUE 240 or OMNIPAQUE 300. It should not be necessary to exceed a maximum dose of 28 gI with OMNIPAQUE 240 or 35 gI with OMNIPAQUE 300.
OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for use in intravenous digital subtraction angiography (I.V.DSA) of the vessels of the head, neck, and abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels.
Arteriograms of diagnostic quality can be obtained following the intravenous administration of contrast media employing digital subtraction and computer imaging enhancement techniques. The intravenous route of administration using these techniques has the advantage of being less invasive than the corresponding selective catheter placement of medium. The dose is administered into a peripheral vein, the superior vena cava or right atrium, usually by mechanical injection although sometimes by rapid manual injection. The technique has been used to visualize the ventricles, aorta and most of its larger branches, including the carotids, cerebrals, vertebrals, renal, celiac, mesenterics, and the major peripheral vessels of the limbs. Radiographic visualization of these structures is possible until significant hemodilution occurs.
OMNIPAQUE 350 can be injected intravenously as a rapid bolus to provide arterial visualization using digital subtraction radiography. Preprocedural medications are not considered necessary.
OMNIPAQUE 350 has provided diagnostic arterial radiographs in about 95% of patients. In some cases, poor arterial visualization has been attributed to patient movement. OMNIPAQUE 350 is very well tolerated in the vascular system. Patient discomfort (general sensation of heat and/or pain) following injection is less than with various other contrast media.
Precautions
Since the contrast medium is usually administered mechanically under high pressure, rupture of smaller peripheral veins can occur. It has been suggested that this can be avoided by using an intravenous catheter threaded proximally beyond larger tributaries or, in the case of the antecubital vein, into the superior vena cava. Sometimes the femoral vein is used. (See PRECAUTIONS - General.)
Adverse Reactions
Cardiovascular system reactions in digital arteriography included transient PVCs (16%) and PACs (6.5%). (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular—General.)
Dosage and Administration
The usual injection volume of OMNIPAQUE 350 for the intravenous digital technique is 30 mL to 50 mL of a 350 mgI/mL solution. This is administered as a bolus at 7.5 to 30 mL/second using a pressure injector. The volume and rate of injection will depend primarily on the type of equipment and technique used.
Frequently three or more injections may be required, up to a total volume not to exceed 250 mL (87.5 gI).
OMNIPAQUE 140 at a concentration of 140 mgI/mL is indicated for use in intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography of head, neck, abdominal, renal and peripheral vessels. The intra-arterial route of administration has the advantages of allowing a lower total dose of contrast agent since there is less hemodilution than with the intravenous route of administration. Patients with poor cardiac output would be expected to have better contrast enhancement following intra-arterial administration as compared with intravenous administration. A higher concentration of contrast agent may be needed to facilitate catheter placement under fluoroscopic control.
Precautions
High pressure intra-arterial injections may cause the rupture of smaller peripheral arteries. (See PRECAUTIONS - General.)
Adverse Reactions
Central nervous system reactions in intra-arterial digital angiography include transient ischemia attacks (1.6%) and cerebral infarctions (1.6%). These occurred in high risk patients having a cerebral examination and the relationship to the contrast medium was uncertain. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS - General.) Headache occurred in 6.3% of the patients, all of whom were having cerebral examinations.
Dosage and Administration
Mechanical or hand injection can be used to administer one or more bolus intra-arterial injections of OMNIPAQUE 140. The volume and rate of injection will depend on the type of equipment, technique used, and the vascular area to be visualized. The following volumes and rates of injection have been used with OMNIPAQUE 140.
 
OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral arteriography. OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for use in peripheral venography.
Sedative medication may be employed prior to use. Anesthesia is not considered necessary. Patient discomfort during and immediately following injection is substantially less than that following injection of various other contrast media. Moderate to severe discomfort is very unusual.
Precautions
Pulsation should be present in the artery to be injected. In thromboangiitis obliterans, or ascending infection associated with severe ischemia, angiography should be performed with extreme caution, if at all. (See PRECAUTIONS - General.)
Adverse Reactions
A transient sensation of mild warmth is usual, immediately following injection. This has not interfered with the procedure.
In phlebography the incidence of leg pain was 21%. This usually was mild and lasted a short time after injection. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular - General.)
Dosage and Administration
The volume required will depend on the size, flow rate, and disease state of the injected vessel and on the size and condition of the patient, as well as the imaging technique used.
The dosage recommended for use in peripheral angiography is as follows:
 
OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated for use in adults in excretory urography to provide diagnostic contrast of the urinary tract.
OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is indicated in children for excretory urography. (See Section III for information on voiding cystourethrography.) For pharmacokinetics of excretion in adults, see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Intravascular.
Precautions
Preparatory dehydration is not recommended in the elderly, infants, young children, diabetic or azotemic patients, or in patients with suspected myelomatosis.
Pediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing adverse events during contrast medium administration may include those having asthma, a sensitivity to medication and/or allergens, congestive heart failure, a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or those less than 12 months of age.
Since there is a possibility of temporary suppression of urine formation, it is recommended that a suitable interval elapse before excretory urography is repeated, especially in patients with unilateral or  bilateral reduction in renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS - General.)
Adverse Reactions
See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Intravascular - General.
Dosage and Administration
Adults: OMNIPAQUE 300 and OMNIPAQUE 350 at dosages from 200 mgI/kg body weight to 350 mgI/kg body weight have produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory system in patients with normal renal function.
Pediatrics: Excretory Urography
OMNIPAQUE 300 at doses of 0.5 mL/kg to 3.0 mL/kg of body weight   has produced diagnostic opacification of the excretory tract. The usual dose   for children is 1.0 mL/kg to 1.5 mL/kg. Dosage for infants and children should   be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg.
See SECTION II, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION - General.
Oral Use
Adults: OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for use in oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract.
OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 6 mgI/mL to 9 mgI/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL administered intravenously is indicated in adults for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen. Dilute oral plus intravenous OMNIPAQUE may be useful when unenhanced imaging does not provide sufficient delineation between normal loops of the bowel and adjacent organs or areas of suspected pathology.
Children: OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL administered orally or rectally is indicated in children for use in examination of the gastrointestinal tract.
OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL administered orally or rectally is indicated in children for use in examination of the gastrointestinal tract.
OMNIPAQUE 180 at a concentration of 180 mgI/mL administered orally or rectally is indicated in children for use in examination of the gastrointestinal tract.
OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 9 mgI/mL to 21 mgI/mL administered orally in conjunction with OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL administered intravenously is indicated in children for use in contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.
Precautions
See PRECAUTIONS—General.
Adverse Reactions
Oral administration of OMNIPAQUE is most often associated with mild, transient diarrhea especially when high concentrations and large volumes are administered. Nausea, vomiting, and moderate diarrhea have also been reported following orally administered OMNIPAQUE, but much less frequently. For CT examinations using dilute oral plus intravenous contrast medium, adverse events are more likely to be associated with the intravenous injection than the hypotonic oral solution. It should be noted that serious or anaphylactoid reactions that may occur with intravascular iodinated media are possible following administration by other routes.
Adults: In controlled clinical trials involving 54 adult patients for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 350, the following adverse reactions were reported: diarrhea (42%), nausea (15%), vomiting (11%), abdominal pain (7%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%).
In controlled clinical studies involving 44 adult patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (2%).
Children: In controlled clinical studies involving 58 pediatric patients for examination of the gastrointestinal tract at concentrations of 180 and 300 mgI/mL, the following adverse reactions were reported: diarrhea (36%), vomiting (9%), nausea (5%), fever (5%), hypotension (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and urticaria (2%). In clinical studies an increased frequency and severity of diarrhea was noted with an increase in the administered concentration and dose of the radiocontrast agent.
In controlled clinical studies involving 69 pediatric patients for dilute oral plus intravenous CT examination of the gastrointestinal tract using OMNIPAQUE 240 and OMNIPAQUE 300, adverse reactions were limited to a single report of vomiting (1.4%).
Dosage and Administration
Adults: The recommended dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract in adults is 50 mL to 100 mL depending on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient.
The recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 6 mgI/mL to 9 mgI/mL for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen in adults is 500 mL to 1000 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). In conjunction with dilute oral administration, the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 300 administered intravenously is 100 mL to 150 mL. The oral dose is administered about 20 to 40 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition.
Children: The dosage of undiluted OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL, OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 180 at a concentration of 180 mgI/mL for oral pass-thru examination of the gastrointestinal tract in children is dependent on the nature of the examination and the size of the patient. Based on clinical experience, it is recommended that OMNIPAQUE 180 be used in children less than 3 months of age.
OMNIPAQUE 180, OMNIPAQUE 240 or OMNIPAQUE 300 may be used in children 3 months of age and older. The following dosage guidelines are recommended:
 
When given rectally, larger volumes may be used.
The recommended oral dosage of OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations of 9 mgI/mL to 21 mgI/mL for contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen in children is 180 mL to 750 mL. Smaller administered volumes are needed as the concentration of the final solution is increased (see Table below). The total oral dose in grams of iodine should generally not exceed 5 gI for children under 3 years of age and 10 gI for children from 3 to 18 years of age. The oral dosage may be given all at once or over a period of 30 to 45 minutes if there is difficulty in consuming the required volume.
In conjunction with dilute oral administration the recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 240 and OMNIPAQUE 300 is 2.0 mL/kg when administered intravenously with a range of 1.0 mL/kg to 2.0 mL/kg. Dosage for infants and children should be administered in proportion to age and body weight. The total intravenously administered dose should not exceed 3 mL/kg. The oral dose is administered about 30 to 60 minutes prior to the intravenous dose and image acquisition. OMNIPAQUE may be diluted with water or beverage as follows:
 
Dilutions of OMNIPAQUE should be prepared just prior to use and any unused portion discarded after the procedure.
OMNIPAQUE diluted to concentrations from 50 mgI/mL to 100 mgI/mL is indicated in children for voiding cystourethrography. VCUs are often performed in conjunction with excretory urography.
Precautions
See PRECAUTIONS - General.
Since the VCU procedure requires instrumentation, special precautions should be observed in those patients known to have an acute urinary tract infection. Filling of the bladder should be done at a steady rate, exercising caution to avoid excessive pressure. Sterile procedures are essential.
Adverse Reactions
See ADVERSE REACTIONS - General.
Dosage and Administration
OMNIPAQUE may be diluted, utilizing aseptic technique, with Sterile Water for Injection to a concentration of 50 mgI/mL to 100 mgI/mL for voiding cystourethrography. The concentration may vary depending upon the patient's size and age and also with the technique and equipment used. Sufficient volume of contrast medium should be administered to adequately fill the bladder. The usual volume ranges from 50 mL to 300 mL of OMNIPAQUE at a concentration of 100 mgI/mL and 50 mL to 600 mL of OMNIPAQUE at a concentration of 50 mgI/mL. OMNIPAQUE may be diluted with Sterile Water for Injection as indicated in the table below:
 
Dilutions of OMNIPAQUE should be prepared just prior to use and any unused portion discarded after the procedure.
OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 350 at a concentration of 350 mgI/mL is indicated in radiography of the knee joint in adults, and OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is indicated in radiography of the shoulder joint  in adults, and OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is indicated in radiography of the temporomandibular joint in adults. Arthrography may be helpful in the diagnosis of posttraumatic or degenerative joint diseases, synovial rupture, the visualization of communicating bursae or cysts, and in meniscography.
Precautions
See PRECAUTIONS - General.
Strict aseptic technique is required to prevent infection. Fluoroscopic control should be used to ensure proper needle placement, prevent extracapsular injection, and prevent dilution of contrast medium. Undue pressure should not be exerted during injection.
Adverse Reactions
Injection of OMNIPAQUE into the joint is associated with transient discomfort, ie, pain, swelling. However, delayed, severe or persistent discomfort may occur occasionally. Severe pain may often result from undue use of pressure or the injection of large volumes. Joint swelling after injection is less with OMNIPAQUE than with high osmolar ionic contrast medium. These types of reactions are generally procedurally dependent and of greater frequency when doublecontrast technique is employed.
Nervous system: Swelling sensation (42%), pain (29%), heat sensation (13%), and muscle weakness (0.7%).
Skin and appendages: Hematoma at injection site (0.7%).
Dosage and Administration
Arthrography is usually performed under local anesthesia. The amount of OMNIPAQUE injected is dependent on the size of the joint to be examined and the technique employed. Lower volumes of contrast medium are usually injected for knee and shoulder arthrography when double-contrast examinations using 15 mL to 100 mL of air are performed.
The following concentrations and volumes are recommended for normal adult knee, shoulder, and temporomandibular joints but should serve as guidelines since joints may require more or less contrast medium for optimal visualization.
 
Passive or active manipulation is used to disperse the medium throughout the joint space.
ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE PANCREATOGRAPHY (ERP)/ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY (ERCP)
OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for use in ERP/ERCP.
Precautions
See PRECAUTIONS - General.
Adverse Reactions
Injection of OMNIPAQUE in ERP/ERCP is associated with transient pain. However, delayed, severe or persistent pain may occur and can persist for 24 hours. The cause of the pain may be due as much to the procedure itself as to the contrast medium injected, therefore, attention should be paid to the injection pressure and total volume injected to minimize disruptive distention of the ducts examined.
Cardiovascular system: Hypertension (1%).
Nervous system: Pain (17%), somnolence (1%), and burning (1%).
Gastrointestinal system: Vomiting, diarrhea, and pressure, each with an individual incidence of 1%.
Dosage and Administration
The recommended dose of OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL is 10 mL to 50 mL but may vary depending on individual anatomy  and/or disease state.
OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL or OMNIPAQUE 300 at a concentration of 300 mgI/mL is indicated in radiography of the internal group of adult female reproductive organs: ovaries, fallopian  tubes, uterus, and vagina. Hysterosalpingography is utilized as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the treatment of infertility and other abnormal gynecological conditions.
Contraindications
The procedure should not be performed during the menstrual period or when menstrual flow is imminent, nor should it be performed when infection is present in any portion of the genital tract, including the external genitalia. The procedure is also contraindicated for pregnant women or for those in whom pregnancy is suspected. Its use is not advised for 6 months after termination of pregnancy or 30 days after conization or curettage.
Precautions
In patients with carcinoma or in those in whom the condition is suspected, caution should be exercised to avoid possible spreading of the lesion by the procedure.
Adverse Reactions
Injection of OMNIPAQUE in hysterosalpingography is associated with immediate but transient pain. The cause of the pain may be due as much to the procedure itself as to the contrast medium injected, therefore attention should be paid to the injection pressure and volume instilled to avoid disruptive distention of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluoroscopic monitoring is recommended.
Nervous system: Pain (49%), somnolence and fever each with an individual incidence of 3%.
Gastrointestinal system: Nausea (3%).
Dosage and Administration
The recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 240 is 15 mL to 20 mL and of OMNIPAQUE 300 is 15 mL to 20 mL but will vary depending on individual anatomy and/or disease state.
OMNIPAQUE 240 at a concentration of 240 mgI/mL is indicated in adults for use in herniography.
Precautions
See PRECAUTIONS - General.
Adverse Reactions
Nervous system: Pain (7%), headache (3%), and  unwell feeling (3%).
Gastrointestinal system: Diarrhea (3%) and flatulence (10%).
Dosage and Administration
The recommended dosage of OMNIPAQUE 240 is 50 mL but may vary depending on individual anatomy and/or disease state.
