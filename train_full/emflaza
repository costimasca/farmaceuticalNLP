The recommended oral dosage of EMFLAZA is approximately 0.9 mg/kg/day once daily. If tablets are used, round up to the nearest possible dose. Any combination of the four EMFLAZA tablet strengths can be used to achieve this dose. If the oral suspension is used, round up to the nearest tenth of a milliliter (mL).
Dosage of EMFLAZA must be decreased gradually if the drug has been administered for more than a few days [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
EMFLAZA Tablets and Oral Suspension can be taken with or without food.
EMFLAZA Tablets can be administered whole or crushed and taken immediately after mixing with applesauce.
Shake EMFLAZA Oral Suspension well before administration.
Use only the oral dispenser provided with the product. After withdrawing the appropriate dose into the oral dispenser, slowly add the EMFLAZA Oral Suspension into 3 to 4 ounces of juice or milk and mix well. The dose should then be administered immediately. Do not administer EMFLAZA with grapefruit juice [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
Discard any unused EMFLAZA Oral Suspension remaining after 1 month of first opening the bottle.
Give one third of the recommended   dosage when EMFLAZA is administered with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.   For example, a 36 mg per day dose would be reduced to a 12 mg per day dose when   used with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Avoid use with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers with EMFLAZA [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
