The single-dose vial of CernevitTM (multivitamins for infusion) is reconstituted by adding 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection into the vial and gently mixing to dissolve the lyophilized powder. The resultant solution should be administered by intravenous infusion. After reconstitution, CernevitTM (multivitamins for infusion) should be used immediately or stored under refrigeration for no more than 24 hours. To minimize vitamin losses in parenteral nutrition admixtures, add the vitamins immediately prior to administration and complete administration within 24 hours.5 Discard any unused portion. Many parenteral vitamins are light sensitive and exposure to light should be minimized. 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Use of a final filter is recommended during administration of all parenteral solutions where possible.
Adults and Children aged 11 years and above
