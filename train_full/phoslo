The recommended initial dose of PhosLo (calcium acetate tablet)  for the adult dialysis patient is 2 tablets with each meal. The dosage may be increased gradually to bring the serum phosphate value below 6 mg/dl, as long as hypercalcemia does not develop. Most patients require 3-4 tablets with each meal.
