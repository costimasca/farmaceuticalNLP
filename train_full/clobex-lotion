CLOBEX® Lotion, 0.05% should be applied to the affected skin areas twice daily and rubbed in gently and completely. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE.)
CLOBEX® Lotion, 0.05% contains a super-high potent topical corticosteroid; therefore treatment should be limited to:
The total dosage should not exceed 50 g (50 mL or 1.75 fl. oz.) per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
Therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
Use in pediatric patients younger than 18 years is not recommended because of numerically high rates of HPA axis suppression (See PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).
Unless directed by physician, CLOBEX® Lotion, 0.05% should not be used with occlusive dressings.
