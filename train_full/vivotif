One capsule is to be swallowed approximately 1 hour before a meal with a cold or luke-warm [temperature not to exceed body temperature, e.g., 37 °C (98.6 °F)] drink on alternate days, e.g., days 1, 3, 5 and 7. Immunization (ingestion of all 4 doses of Vivotif (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a) should be completed at least 1 week prior to potential exposure to S. typhi. The blister containing the vaccine capsules should be inspected to ensure that the foil seal and capsules are intact. The vaccine capsule should not be chewed and should be swallowed as soon after placing in the mouth as possible. A complete immunization schedule is the ingestion of 4 vaccine capsules as described above.
The optimum booster schedule for Vivotif has not been determined. Efficacy has been shown to persist for at least 5 years. Further, there is no experience with Vivotif as a booster in persons previously immunized with parenteral typhoid vaccine. It is recommended that a re-immunization dose consisting of 4 vaccine capsules taken on alternate days be given every 5 years under conditions of repeated or continued exposure to typhoid fever (7).
