The recommended starting dosage of AGRYLIN is 0.5 mg four times daily or 1 mg twice daily.
The recommended starting dosage of AGRYLIN is 0.5 mg daily.
Continue the starting dose for at least one week and then titrate to reduce and maintain the platelet count below 600,000/μL, and ideally between 150,000/μL and 400,000/μL. The dose increment should not exceed 0.5 mg/day in any one week. Dosage should not exceed 10 mg/day or 2.5 mg in a single dose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Most patients will experience an adequate response at a dose of 1.5 to 3.0 mg/day. Monitor platelet counts weekly during titration then monthly or as necessary.
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 7-9) start AGRYLIN therapy at a dose of 0.5 mg/day and monitor frequently for cardiovascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have tolerated AGRYLIN therapy for one week may have their dose increased. The dose increase increment should not exceed 0.5 mg/day in any one week. Avoid use of AGRYLIN in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
AGRYLIN therapy requires clinical monitoring, including complete blood counts, assessment of hepatic and renal function, and electrolytes.
To prevent the occurrence of thrombocytopenia, monitor platelet counts every two days during the first week of treatment and at least weekly thereafter until the maintenance dosage is reached. Typically, platelet counts begin to respond within 7 to 14 days at the proper dosage. In the clinical trials, the time to complete response, defined as platelet count  ≤  600,000/μL, ranged from 4 to 12 weeks. In the event of dosage interruption or treatment withdrawal, the rebound in platelet count is variable, but platelet counts typically will start to rise within 4 days and return to baseline levels in one to two weeks, possibly rebounding above baseline values. Monitor platelet counts frequently.
