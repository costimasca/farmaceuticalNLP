Therapy should be directed by physicians who are knowledgeable in the management of Gaucher disease.
The recommended dose for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease is one 100 mg capsule administered orally three times a day at regular intervals. If a dose is missed, the next Zavesca capsule should be taken at the next scheduled time.
It may be necessary to reduce the dose to one 100 mg capsule once or twice a day in some patients due to adverse reactions, such as  tremor or diarrhea.
In patients with mild renal impairment (adjusted creatinine clearance 50-70 mL/min/1.73 m²), Zavesca administration should commence at a dose of 100 mg twice per day. In patients with moderate renal impairment (adjusted creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min/1.73 m²), Zavesca administration should commence at a dose of one 100 mg capsule per day. Use of Zavesca in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  <  30 mL/min/1.73 m²) is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations].
