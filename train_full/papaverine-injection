Papaverine hydrochloride may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.    The intravenous route is recommended when an immediate effect is desired, but    the drug must be injected slowly over the course of 1 or 2 minutes    to avoid uncomfortable or alarming side effects.
Parenteral administration of papaverine hydrochloride in doses of 1 to 4 mL is repeated every 3 hours as indicated. In the treatment of cardiac extrasystoles, 2 doses may be given 10 minutes apart.
