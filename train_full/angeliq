Each pack of Angeliq covers 28 days of treatment. Treatment is continuous, which means that the next pack follows immediately without a break. The tablets are to be swallowed whole with some liquid irrespective of food intake and should preferably be taken at the same time every day. In case a tablet is forgotten, it should be taken as soon as possible. If more than 24 hours have elapsed, the missed tablet should not be taken. If several tablets are forgotten, bleeding may occur.
Women who do not take estrogens or women who change from a continuous combination product may start treatment at any time. Women changing from a continuous sequential or cyclic hormone therapy (HT) should complete the current cycle of therapy before initiating Angeliq therapy.
Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a  progestin, should be limited to the lowest effective dose available and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary [see BOXED WARNING].
