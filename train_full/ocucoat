Clinical Applications:   In anterior segment surgery, OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  should be carefully introduced into the anterior chamber using a 20 gauge or smaller cannula. OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  may be injected into the chamber prior to or following delivery of the crystalline lens. Injection of OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  prior to lens delivery will provide additional protection to the corneal endothelium and other ocular tissues. Injection of the material at this point is significant in that a coating of OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  may protect the corneal endothelium from possible damage arising from surgical instrumentation during the cataract extraction surgery. 
OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  may also be used to coat an intraocular lens as well as tips of surgical instruments prior to implantation surgery. Additional OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  may be injected during anterior segment surgery to fully maintain the chamber or to replace fluid lost during the surgical procedure. OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  should be removed from the anterior chamber at the end of surgery. Rather than aspirate OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  from the eye with the OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  syringe, it is recommended that OCUCOAT (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)  be aspirated using an automated I/A device, or irrigated using an irrigation syringe or a BSS squeeze bottle.
