The recommended dose is one drop of SIMBRINZA in the affected eye(s) three times daily. Shake well before use. SIMBRINZA ophthalmic suspension may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.
