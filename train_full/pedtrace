The suggested dosage ranges for the four trace elements in neonates and pediatric patients are:
Periodic monitoring of plasma levels of zinc, copper, manganese and chromium is suggested as a guideline preparation.
Aseptic addition of Pedtrace®-4 to the TPN solution under a laminar wflow hood is recommended. The trace elements present in Pedtrace (zinc, copper, manganese and chromium intravenous solution) ®-4 are physically compatible with the electrolytes and vitamins usually present in the amino acid/dextrose solution used for TPN.
Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
