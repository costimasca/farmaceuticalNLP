GLUCOTROL XL should be administered orally with breakfast or the first main meal of the day.
The recommended starting dose of GLUCOTROL XL is 5 mg once daily. Start patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia (e.g. the elderly or patients with hepatic insufficiency) at 2.5 mg [see Use in Specific Population].
Dosage adjustment can be made based on the patient's glycemic control. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg once daily.
Patients receiving immediate release glipizide may be switched to GLUCOTROL XL once daily at the nearest equivalent total daily dose.
When adding GLUCOTROL XL to other anti-diabetic drugs, initiate GLUCOTROL XL at 5 mg once daily. Start patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia at a lower dose.
When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, GLUCOTROL XL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.
