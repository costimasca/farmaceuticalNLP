Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter   and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.   If particles or discoloration are observed, the product should not be used and   it should be discarded.
CANDIN® (candida albicans)  should be administered intradermally on the volar surface of the  forearm or on the outer aspect of the upper arm. The test dose is 0.1 mL. The   skin should be cleansed with 70% alcohol before applying the skin test. The   intradermal injection must be given as superficially as possible causing a distinct,   sharply defined bleb. An unreliable reaction may result if the product is injected   subcutaneously. A positive DTH reaction to CANDIN® (candida albicans)  consists of induration    ≥  5 mm.
The time required for the induration response to reach maximum intensity varies with the individual. The reaction usually begins within 24 hours and peaks between 24 and 48 hours. The skin test should be read at 48 hours by visually inspecting the test site and palpating the indurated area. Measurements should be made across two diameters as shown in the figure below. The mean of the longest and midpoint orthogonal diameters of the indurated area should be reported as the DTH response. For example, a reaction that is 10 mm (longest diameter) by 8 mm (midpoint orthogonal diameter) has a sum of 18 mm and a mean of 9 mm. The DTH response is therefore 9 mm.
