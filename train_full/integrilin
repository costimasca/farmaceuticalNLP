Before infusion of INTEGRILIN, the following laboratory tests should be performed to identify preexisting hemostatic abnormalities: hematocrit or hemoglobin, platelet count, serum creatinine, and PT/aPTT. In patients undergoing PCI, the activated clotting time (ACT) should also be measured.
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be maintained between 50 and 70 seconds unless PCI is to be performed. In patients treated with heparin, bleeding can be minimized by close monitoring of the aPTT and ACT.
 
INTEGRILIN should be given concomitantly with heparin dosed to achieve the following parameters:
Target aPTT 50 to 70 seconds
Target ACT 200 to 300 seconds
 
Patients requiring thrombolytic therapy should discontinue INTEGRILIN.
Administer INTEGRILIN by volume according to patient weight (see Table 1).
