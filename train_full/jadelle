JadelleÂ® (levonorgestrel implants (unavailable in us))  implants are a set of two flexible cylindrical implants, each   containing 75 mg of the progestin levonorgestrel. The total administered (implanted)   dose is 150 mg. Insertion of the two implants should be performed during the   first 7 days following the onset of menses by a health-care professional familiar   with the levonorgestrel implant insertion technique. It is strongly recommended   that all health-care providers receive instruction in the proper insertion and   removal procedures. Insertion is subdermal in the midportion of the inner surface   of the upper arm about 8 to 10 cm above the medial epicondyle. The two implants   should be placed in a "V" shape about 30 degrees apart. Proper insertion   will facilitate removal. (See "Instructions for Insertion and Removal.")
