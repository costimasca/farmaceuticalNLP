Ensure the affected area is clean and dry. Unless otherwise directed by your healthcare practitioner, apply Recedo evenly in a thin layer twice daily. For maximum effect, Recedo should have 24-hour contact with the skin. Once dry, Recedo can be covered with sunscreen, cosmetics or pressure garments. If Recedo has not dried within 4-5 minutes, you have probably applied too much. Gently remove the excess and allow the drying process to continue. 
Recommended minimum treatment time is 60–90 days. It may take longer than 90 days for older and larger scars to achieve full benefit. Talk to your physician if extended use recommended.
