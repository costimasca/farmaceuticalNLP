The recommended SILIQ dose is 210 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0, 1, and 2 followed by 210 mg every 2 weeks.
If an adequate response has not been achieved after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment with SILIQ, consider discontinuing therapy. Continued treatment beyond 16 weeks in patients who have not achieved an adequate response is not likely to result in greater success.
Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with SILIQ [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Administer SILIQ subcutaneously. Each prefilled syringe is for single-dose only.
Instruct patients to review the Medication Guide before use (see PATIENT INFORMATION). SILIQ is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare professional. Patients may self-inject SILIQ when deemed appropriate by a healthcare professional and after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique using the prefilled syringe.
Advise patients who are self-administering to inject the full dose and to read the Instructions for Use before administration (see Instructions for Use).
Do not inject SILIQ into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, or affected by psoriasis.
