Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of TOLECTIN (tolmetin sodium)  and other treatment    options before deciding to use TOLECTIN (tolmetin sodium) . Use the lowest effective dose for the    shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).
After observing the response to initial therapy with TOLECTIN (tolmetin sodium) , the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, the recommended starting    dose for adults is 400 mg three times daily (1200 mg daily), preferably including    a dose on arising and a dose at bedtime. To achieve optimal therapeutic effect    the dose should be adjusted according to the patient's response after one or    two weeks. Control is usually achieved at doses of 600-1800 mg daily in divided    doses (generally t.i.d.). Doses larger than 1800 mg/day have not been studied    and are not recommended.
For the relief of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (2 years and older) is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses (t.i.d. or q.i.d.). When control has been achieved, the usual dose ranges from 15 to 30 mg/kg/day. Doses higher than 30 mg/kg/day have not been studied, and, therefore, are not recommended.
A therapeutic response to TOLECTIN (tolmetin sodium) can be expected in a few    days to a week. Progressive improvement can be anticipated during succeeding    weeks of therapy. If gastrointestinal symptoms occur, TOLECTIN (tolmetin sodium)  can be administered    with antacids other than sodium bicarbonate. TOLECTIN (tolmetin sodium)  bioavailability and pharmacokinetics    are not significantly affected by acute or chronic administration of magnesium    and aluminum hydroxides; however, bioavailability is affected by food or milk    (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Food Interaction).
