The usual dosage of pentoxifylline in extended-release tablet form is one tablet (400 mg) three times a day with meals.
While the effect of pentoxifylline may be seen within 2 to 4 weeks, it is recommended that treatment be continued for at least 8 weeks. Efficacy has been demonstrated in double-blind clinical studies of 6 months duration.
Digestive and central nervous system side effects are dose related. If patients develop these effects it is recommended that the dosage be lowered to one tablet twice a day (800 mg/day). If side effects persist at this lower dosage, the administration of pentoxifylline should be discontinued.
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min) reduce dose to 400 mg once a day.
Dosing information cannot be provided for patients with hepatic impairment.
