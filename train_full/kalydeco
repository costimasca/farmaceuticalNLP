When KALYDECO is being co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), the dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice a week. The dose of KALYDECO should be reduced to 150 mg once daily when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole). Food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and PATIENT INFORMATION].
