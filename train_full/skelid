A single 400-mg daily oral dose of SKELID (tiludronate) , taken with 6 to 8 ounces of plain    water only, should be administered for a period of 3 months. Beverages other    than plain water (including mineral water), food (see below), and some    medications (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS)    are likely to reduce the absorption of SKELID (see CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).
Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking this medication.   In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental or physical   disability, therapy with SKELID (tiludronate)  should be used under appropriate supervision   (See WARNINGS).
SKELID (tiludronate)  should not be taken within 2 hours of food.
Calcium or mineral supplements should be taken at least 2 hours before or two hours after SKELID (tiludronate) . Aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids, if needed, should be taken at least two hours after taking SKELID (tiludronate) .
SKELID (tiludronate)  should not be taken within 2 hours of indomethacin.
Following therapy, allow an interval of 3 months to assess response. Specific data regarding retreatment are limited, although results from uncontrolled studies indicate favorable biochemical improvement similar to initial SKELID (tiludronate)  treatment.
