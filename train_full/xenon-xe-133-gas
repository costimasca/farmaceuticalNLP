Xenon Xe 133 gas is administered by inhalation from closed respirator systems or spirometers.
The suggested activity range employed for inhalation by the average adult patient (70 kg) is:
Pulmonary function including imaging: 74-1110MBq (2-30mCi) in 3 liters of air.
Cerebral blood flow: 370-1110MBq (10-30mCi) in 3 liters of air.
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.
The estimated absorbed radiation doses2 to an average patient (70 kg) for pulmonary perfusion and cerebral blood flow studies from a maximum dose of 1110 MBq (30mCi) of Xenon Xe 133 in 3 liters of air are shown in Table 4.
