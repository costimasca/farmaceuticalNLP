Voluven® is administered by intravenous infusion only. The daily dose and rate of infusion depend on the patient’s blood loss, on the maintenance or restoration of hemodynamics and on the hemodilution (dilution effect). Voluven® can be administered repetitively over several days. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]
The initial 10 to 20 mL should be infused slowly, keeping the patient under close observation due to possible anaphylactoid reactions. [see General WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]
Up to 50 mL of Voluven® per kg of body weight per day (equivalent to 3 g hydroxyethyl starch and 7.7 mEq sodium per kg of body weight). This dose is equivalent to 3500 mL of Voluven® for a 70 kg patient.
The dosage in children should be adapted to the individual patient colloid needs, taking into account the disease state, as well as the hemodynamic and hydration status.
In 41 newborns to infants (< 2 years), a mean dose of 16 ± 9 mL/kg was administered. In 31 children from 2 – 12 years of age a mean dose of 36 ± 11 mL/kg was administered. The dose in adolescents > 12 is the same as the adult dose. [see Pediatric Use]
