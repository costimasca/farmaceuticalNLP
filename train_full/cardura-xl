The initial dose of CARDURA XL, 4 mg given once daily, should be administered with breakfast. Depending on the patient's symptomatic response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 8 mg, the maximum recommended dose. The recommended titration interval is 3-4 weeks. If CARDURA XL administration is discontinued for several days, therapy should be restarted using the 4 mg once daily dose. Tablets should be swallowed whole, and must not be chewed, divided, cut, or crushed.
If switching from CARDURA immediate-release (IR) to CARDURA XL, therapy should be initiated with the lowest dose (4 mg once daily). Prior to starting therapy with CARDURA XL, the final evening dose of CARDURA should not be taken.
Concomitant administration of CARDURA XL with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension; therefore, PDE-5 inhibitor therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose in patients taking CARDURA XL.
