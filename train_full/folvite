Oral Administration: Folic acid is well absorbed and may be administered orally with satisfactory results except in severe instances of intestinal malabsorption.
Parenteral Administration: Intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutaneous routes may be used if the disease is exceptionally severe, or if gastrointestinal absorption may be, or is known to be, impaired.
Usual Therapeutic Dosage: Adults and children regardless of age, up to 1.0 mg daily. Resistant cases may require larger doses.
Maintenance Level: When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture has become normal, a maintenance level should be used, i.e., 0.1 mg for infants and up to 0.3 mg for children under four years of age, 0.4 mg for adults and children four or more years of age, and 0.8 mg for pregnant and lactating women, per day, but never less than 0.1 mg per day. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent.
In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased.
