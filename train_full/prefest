Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the    lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment    goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically    as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine    if treatment is still necessary (See BOXED WARNINGS    and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus,    adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated,    should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent    or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.
PREFEST (estradiol, norgestimate)  regimen consists of the daily administration of a single tablet containing 1 mg estradiol (pink color) for three days followed by a single tablet of 1 mg estradiol combined with 0.09 mg norgestimate (white color) for three days. This regimen is repeated continuously without interruption.
If a tablet is missed for one or more days, therapy should be resumed with the next available tablet. The patient should continue to take only one tablet each day in sequence.
The lowest effective dose of PREFEST (estradiol, norgestimate)  has not been determined.
