When used dry, GELFOAM Dental Sponges, cut to desired size, are rolled between the fingers and lightly compressed to the approximate diameter of the cavity or socket to be filled. Following insertion of the rolled pack, light finger pressure should be applied for one or two minutes.
When used moistened, GELFOAM, cut to desired size, is immersed in the solution of sodium chloride. The piece is then removed from the solution, squeezed thoroughly to remove air bubbles present in the meshes, and replaced in the solution where it will swell to its original size. It is then taken from the solution, blotted on sterile gauze to remove excess fluid, and placed in the cavity or wound. For use with thrombin, consult the thrombin insert for complete prescribing information and proper sample preparation.
