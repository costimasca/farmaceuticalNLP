Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a  postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer [see BOXED WARNING].
A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
ENJUVIA therapy consists of a single tablet taken orally once daily.
Women should be started at the lowest approved dose of 0.3 mg ENJUVIA daily. Subsequent dosage adjustment may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider.
ENJUVIA therapy consists of a single tablet taken orally once daily.
When prescribing solely for the treatment of moderate to severe vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, topical vaginal products should be considered.
