The daily dose should be taken at the same time each day with food or a milky drink. In the event of vomiting within 1 hour after dosing, a repeat dose should be taken.
MALARONE may be crushed and mixed with condensed milk just prior to administration to patients who may have difficulty swallowing tablets.
Start prophylactic treatment with MALARONE 1 or 2 days before entering a malaria-endemic area and continue daily during the stay and for 7 days after return.
Adults: One MALARONE Tablet (adult strength = 250 mg atovaquone/100 mg proguanil hydrochloride) per day.
Pediatric Patients: The dosage for prevention of malaria in pediatric patients is based upon body weight (Table 1).
Table 1: Dosage for Prevention of Malaria in Pediatric Patients 
Adults: Four MALARONE Tablets (adult strength; total daily dose 1 g atovaquone/400 mg proguanil hydrochloride) as a single daily dose for 3 consecutive days.
Pediatric Patients: The dosage for treatment of acute malaria in pediatric patients is based upon body weight (Table 2).
Table 2: Dosage for Treatment of Acute Malaria in Pediatric Patients 
Do not use MALARONE for malaria prophylaxis in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  < 30 mL/min) [See CONTRAINDICATIONS]. Use with caution for the treatment of malaria in patients with severe renal impairment, only if the benefits of the 3 day treatment regimen outweigh the potential risks associated with increased drug exposure. No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.]
