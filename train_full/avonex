AVONEX is administered intramuscularly.
The recommended dose is 30 micrograms once a week. To reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms that may occur when initiating AVONEX therapy at a dose of 30 micrograms, AVONEX may be started at a dose of 7.5 micrograms and the dose may be increased by 7.5 micrograms each week for the next three weeks until the recommended dose of 30 micrograms is achieved (see Table 1). An AVOSTARTGRIP™ kit containing 3 titration devices can be used for titration and is to be used only with AVONEX Prefilled Syringes.
Table 1: Schedule for Dose Titration 
All AVONEX dosage forms are single-use (injection of reconstituted solution, prefilled syringe, and prefilled autoinjector). See Patient's Instructions for Use for complete administration instructions.
The first AVONEX injection should be performed under the supervision of an appropriately qualified healthcare professional. If patients or caregivers are to administer AVONEX, train them in the proper intramuscular  injection technique and assess their ability to inject intramuscularly to ensure the proper administration of AVONEX.
Advise patients and caregivers to:
A 25 gauge, 1” needle for intramuscular injection with AVONEX prefilled syringe or injection of reconstituted solution may be substituted for the 23 gauge, 1 ¼” needle by the healthcare provider, if deemed appropriate. A 25 gauge, 5/8” needle specific to the prefilled autoinjector is supplied with the AVONEX PEN® Administration Dose Pack. DO NOT use any other needle with the autoinjector.
Use safe disposal procedures for needles and syringes. Do not re-use needles, syringes, prefilled syringes, or autoinjectors. Following the administration of each titrated dose, discard any remaining product.
Concurrent use of analgesics and/or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu-like symptoms associated with AVONEX use.
