The recommended dose of EDURANT is one 25 mg tablet once daily taken orally with a meal [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
For patients concomitantly receiving rifabutin, the EDURANT dose should be increased to 50 mg (two tablets of 25 mg each) once daily, taken with a meal. When rifabutin co-administration is stopped, the EDURANT dose should be decreased to 25 mg once daily, taken with a meal [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
