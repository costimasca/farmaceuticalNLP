Sprintec is dispensed in a blister pack tablet dispenser [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling]. Sprintec may be started using either a Day 1 start or a Sunday start (see Table 1). For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, an additional method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.
Table 1: Instructions for Administration of Sprintec 
There are two ways to start taking birth-control pills,     Sunday Start or Day 1 Start. Your healthcare professional will tell you which     to use.
 
Table 2: Instructions for Missed Sprintec Tablets 
In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking an active tablet, handle this as a missed tablet [see FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].
