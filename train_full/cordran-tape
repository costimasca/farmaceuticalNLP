Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant    conditions.
If an infection develops, the use of Cordran Tape (flurandrenolide tape)  and other occlusive dressings   should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.
Replacement of the tape every 12 hours produces the lowest incidence of adverse   reactions, but it may be left in place for 24 hours if it is well tolerated   and adheres satisfactorily. When necessary, the tape may be used at night only   and removed during the day.
If ends of the tape loosen prematurely, they may be trimmed off and replaced   with fresh tape.
The directions given below are included on a separate package insert for the   patient to follow unless otherwise instructed by the physician.
APPLICATION OF CORDRAN TAPE (flurandrenolide tape) 
IMPORTANT: Skin should be clean and dry before tape is applied.    Tape should always be cut, never torn.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE:
REPLACEMENT OF TAPE:
Unless instructed otherwise by your physician, replace tape after 12 hours.   Cleanse skin and allow it to dry for 1 hour before applying new tape.
IF IRRITATION OR INFECTION DEVELOPS, REMOVE TAPE AND CONSULT PHYSICIAN.
