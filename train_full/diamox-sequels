The recommended dosage is 1 capsule (500 mg) two times a day.  Usually 1 capsule is administered in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening.  It may be necessary to adjust the dose, but it has usually been found that dosage in excess of 2 capsules (1 g) does not produce an increased effect.  The dosage should be adjusted with careful individual attention both to symptomatology and intraocular tension.  In all cases, continuous supervision by a physician is advisable.
In those unusual instances where adequate control is not obtained by the twice-a-day administration of DIAMOX SEQUELS (acetazolamide xr) , the desired control may be established by means of DIAMOX (tablets or parenteral).  Use tablets or parenteral in accordance with the more frequent dosage schedules recommended for these dosage forms, such as 250 mg every four hours, or an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 250 mg or 125 mg every four hours, depending on the case in question.
Acute Mountain Sickness: Dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, in divided    doses using tablets or extended-release capsules as appropriate. In circumstances    of rapid ascent, such as in rescue or military operations, the higher dose level    of 1000 mg is recommended. It is preferable to initiate dosing 24 to 48 hours    before ascent and to continue for 48 hours while at high altitude, or longer    as necessary to control symptoms.
