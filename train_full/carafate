 The recommended adult oral   dosage for duodenal ulcer is 1 g four times per day on an empty stomach.
Antacids may be prescribed as needed for relief of pain but should not be taken within one-half hour before or after sucralfate.
While healing with sucralfate may occur during the first week or two, treatment should be continued for 4 to 8 weeks unless healing has been demonstrated by x-ray or endoscopic examination.
 The recommended adult oral   dosage is 1 g twice a day.
 In general, dose selection for an elderly   patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing   range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac   function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).
