Each mL of PROVAYBLUE™ contains 5 mg methylene blue
Each 10 mL ampule of PROVAYBLUE™ contains 50 mg methylene blue.
PROVAYBLUE™ is hypotonic and may be diluted before use in a solution of 50 mL 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) in order to avoid local pain, particularly in the pediatric population. Use the diluted solution immediately after preparation.
Do not mix with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, because it has been demonstrated that chloride reduces the solubility of methylene blue.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Keep the ampule in the original package to protect from light.
