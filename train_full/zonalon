A thin film of Zonalon (doxepin)  Cream should be applied four times each day with at least a 3 to 4 hour interval between applications.  There are no data to establish the safety and effectiveness of Zonalon (doxepin)  Cream when used for greater than 8 days.  Chronic use beyond eight days may result in higher systemic levels and should be avoided.  Use of Zonalon (doxepin)  cream for longer than 8 days may result in an increased likelihood of contact sensitization.
The risk for sedation may increase with greater body surface area application   of Zonalon cream (See WARNINGS section). Clinical experience has shown   that drowsiness is significantly more common in patients applying Zonalon (doxepin)  Cream   to over 10% of body surface area; therefore, patients with greater than 10%   of body surface area (see WARNINGS section) affected should be particularly   cautioned concerning possible drowsiness and other systemic adverse effects   of doxepin. If excessive drowsiness occurs, it may be necessary to do one or   more of the following: reduce the body surface area treated, reduce the number   of applications per day, reduce the amount of cream applied, or discontinue   the drug.
Occlusive dressings may increase the absorption of most topical drugs; therefore, occlusive dressings should not be utilized with Zonalon (doxepin)  Cream.
