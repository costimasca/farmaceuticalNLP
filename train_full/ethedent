 Follow these instructions unless otherwise instructed by your dental professional:    1. Adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age or older, apply a thin ribbon    of EtheDentâ„¢ (sodium fluoride)  to a toothbrush. Brush thoroughly once daily for two minutes, preferably    at bedtime. 2. After use, adults expectorate. For best results, do not eat,    drink, or rinse for 30 minutes. Pediatric patients, age 6-16, expectorate after    use and rinse mouth thoroughly.
