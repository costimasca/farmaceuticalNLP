THYROGEN should be used by physicians knowledgeable in the management of patients with thyroid cancer.
THYROGEN is indicated as a two-injection regimen. The recommended dosage of THYROGEN is a 0.9 mg intramuscular injection to the buttock followed by a second 0.9 mg intramuscular injection to the buttock 24 hours later.
THYROGEN should be administered intramuscularly only. THYROGEN should not be administered intravenously.
Pretreatment with glucocorticoids should be considered for patients in whom tumor expansion may compromise vital anatomic structures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Routine measurement of serum TSH levels is not recommended after THYROGEN use.
The supplied lyophilized powder must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection. THYROGEN should be prepared, and administered in the following manner:
For serum thyroglobulin testing, the serum sample should be obtained 72 hours after the final injection of THYROGEN [see Clinical Studies].
Oral radioiodine should be given 24 hours after the second injection of THYROGEN in both remnant ablation and diagnostic scanning. The activity of 131I is carefully selected at the discretion of the  nuclear medicine physician.
Diagnostic scanning should be performed 48 hours after the radioiodine administration.
