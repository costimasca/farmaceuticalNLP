Otitis Externa: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of    otitis externa is:
Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice      daily for ten days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in      the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the      instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected      ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. The tragus should then      be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration of the drops      into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes.      Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.
Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media with perforated tympanic membranes:    The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis    media with perforated tympanic membranes in patients 12 years and older is:
Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice      daily for fourteen days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle      in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from      the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected      ear upward, before instilling the drops. The tragus should then be pumped      4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration into the middle ear. This      position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for      the opposite ear.
