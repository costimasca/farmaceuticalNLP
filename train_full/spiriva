For oral inhalation only. Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules, as the intended effects on the lungs will not be obtained. The contents of the SPIRIVA capsules should only be used with the HANDIHALER device [see OVERDOSAGE]
The recommended dose of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER is two inhalations of the powder contents of one SPIRIVA capsule, once-daily, with the HANDIHALER device [see PATIENT INFORMATION]. Do not take more than one dose in 24 hours.
For administration of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, a SPIRIVA capsule is placed into the center chamber of the HANDIHALER device. The SPIRIVA capsule is pierced by pressing and releasing the green piercing button on the side of the HANDIHALER device. The tiotropium formulation is dispersed into the air stream when the patient inhales through the mouthpiece [see PATIENT INFORMATION]
No dosage adjustment is required for geriatric, hepatically-impaired, or renally-impaired patients. However, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment given SPIRIVA HANDIHALER should be monitored closely for anticholinergic effects [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
