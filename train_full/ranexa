Initiate RANEXA dosing at 500 mg twice daily and increase to 1000 mg twice daily, as needed, based on clinical symptoms. Take RANEXA with or without meals. Swallow RANEXA tablets whole; do not crush, break, or chew.
The maximum recommended daily dose of RANEXA is 1000 mg twice daily.
If a dose of RANEXA is missed, take the prescribed dose at the next scheduled time; do not double the next dose.
Dose adjustments may be needed when RANEXA is taken in combination with certain other drugs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Limit the maximum dose of RANEXA to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as diltiazem, verapamil, and erythromycin. Use of RANEXA with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Use of P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may increase exposure to RANEXA. Titrate RANEXA based on clinical response [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
