ARNUITY ELLIPTA should be administered only by the orally inhaled route [see Instructions for Use in the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet]. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after each dose.
ARNUITY ELLIPTA should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily by the orally inhaled route. ARNUITY ELLIPTA should be used at the same time every day. Do not use ARNUITY ELLIPTA more than 1 time every 24 hours.
The starting dosage for ARNUITY ELLIPTA is based upon patients' asthma severity. The usual recommended starting dose for patients not on an inhaled corticosteroid is 100 mcg. For other patients, the starting dose should be based on previous asthma drug therapy and disease severity. For patients who do not respond to ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg after 2 weeks of therapy, replacement with ARNUITY ELLIPTA 200 mcg may provide additional asthma control.
If a dosage regimen of ARNUITY ELLIPTA fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, e.g., replacing the current strength of ARNUITY ELLIPTA with a higher strength, initiating an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) combination product, or initiating oral corticosteroids, should be considered.
The highest recommended daily dose is 200 mcg. If symptoms arise between doses, an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist should be used for immediate relief.
The maximum benefit may not be achieved for up to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients may experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.
After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to help reduce the possibility of side effects.
