Caffeine and Sodium Benzoate Injection (caffeine alkaloid)  may be administered by intramuscular    or slow intravenous injection Some clinicians suggest that when used as a mild    CNS stimulant to overcome fatigue, oral doses of 100 200 mg of anhydrous caffeine    are required. One manufacturer recommends that citrated caffeine administered    orally in dosages of 65-325 mg (about 32-162 mg of anhydrous caffeine) 3 times    daily. Another manufacturer recommends an oral dosage of 250 mg of anhydrous    caffeine in an extended-release formulation once daily, but warns that the drug    should not be administered less than 6 hours before retiring.
Analeptic use of caffeine is strongly discouraged by most clinicians. However,    the manufacturer of Caffeine Sodium Benzoate Injection recommends intramuscular,    or in emergency respiratory failure, intravenous injection of 500 mg of the    drug (about 250 mg of anhydrous caffeine) or a maximum single dose of 1 gram    (about 500 mg of anhydrous caffeine) for the treatment of respiratory depression    associated with overdosage of CNS depressants, including narcotic analgesics    and alcohol, and with electric shock.
The usual dose is 0.5 g (7Â½ grains) as frequently as directed by the    physician. The maximum safe dose 0.5 g and the total dose in 24 hours should    rarely exceed 2.5 g.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
