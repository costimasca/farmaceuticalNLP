Dosage should be determined by individual titration (see boxed WARNING).
The usual dosage is one hydralazine HCl and hydrochlorothiazide capsule twice daily, the strength depending upon individual requirement following titration. For maintenance, the dosage should be adjusted to the lowest effective level. 
When necessary, other antihypertensive agents such as sympathetic inhibitors may be added gradually in reduced dosages, and the effects should be watched carefully.
