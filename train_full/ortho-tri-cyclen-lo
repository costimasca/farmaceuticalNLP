SET THE DAY:
Insert the new refill by lining up the “V” shape on the refill with the “V” shape at the top of the DIALPAK. Snap the refill in place. Pill “1” is ready to be taken. Always begin the pill cycle with pill “1,” as shown on the inner part of the refill ring.
 
Remove pill “1” by pushing down on the pill. The pill will come out through a hole in the back of the DIALPAK.
The patient should wait 24 hours to take the next pill. To take pill “2,” turn the dial on the DIALPAK in a clockwise direction to the next day. Continue to take one pill each day until all the pills have been taken.
Turn the dial to the pill “1” position to remove the empty refill and insert a new refill. The first pill in every refill will always be taken on the same day of the week, no matter when the patientâ€™s next period starts.
