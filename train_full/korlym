The recommended starting dose is 300 mg orally once daily. Korlym must be given as a single daily dose. Korlym should always be taken with a meal. Patients should swallow the tablet whole. Do not split, crush, or chew tablets.
The daily dose of Korlym may be increased in 300 mg increments. The dose of Korlym may be increased to a maximum of 1200 mg once daily but should not exceed 20 mg/kg per day. Increases in dose should not occur more frequently than once every 2-4 weeks. Decisions about dose increases should be based on a clinical assessment of tolerability and degree of improvement in Cushing's syndrome manifestations. Changes in glucose control, antidiabetic medication requirements, insulin levels, and psychiatric symptoms may provide an early assessment of response (within 6 weeks) and may help guide early dose titration. Improvements in cushingoid appearance, acne, hirsutism, striae, and body weight occur over a longer period of time and, along with measures of glucose control, may be used to determine dose changes beyond the first 2 months of therapy. Careful and gradual titration of Korlym accompanied by monitoring for recognized adverse reactions (See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS may reduce the risk of severe adverse reactions. Dose reduction or even dose discontinuation may be needed in some clinical situations. If Korlym treatment is interrupted, it should be reinitiated at the lowest dose (300 mg). If treatment was interrupted because of adverse reactions, the titration should aim for a dose lower than the one that resulted in treatment interruption.
No change in initial dose of Korlym is required in renal impairment. The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg. [See Renal Impairment and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]
No change in the initial dose of Korlym is required in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg. Korlym should not be used in severe hepatic impairment. [See Hepatic Impairment and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]
