Therapy with anabolic steroids is adjunctive to and not a replacement for conventional   therapy. The duration of therapy with Oxandrin (oxandrolone) will depend on   the response of the patient and the possible appearance of adverse reactions.   Therapy should be intermittent.
Adults: The response of individuals to anabolic steroids varies.   The daily adult dosage is 2.5 mg to 20 mg given in 2 to 4 divided doses. The   desired response may be achieved with as little as 2.5 mg or as much as 20 mg   daily. A course of therapy of 2 to 4 weeks is usually adequate. This may be   repeated intermittently as indicated.
Children: For children the total daily dosage of Oxandrin (oxandrolone)  is    ≤ 0.1 mg per kilogram body weight or  ≤ 0.045 mg per pound of body weight.   This may be repeated intermittently as indicated.
Geriatric Use: Recommended dose for geriatric patients is 5 mg   bid.
