CIPRO Tablets and Oral Suspension should be administered orally as described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables.
The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative microorganism, the integrity of the patientâ€™s host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal and hepatic function.
	Table 1: Adult Dosage Guidelines 
Patients whose therapy is started with CIPRO IV may be switched to CIPRO Tablets or Oral Suspension when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician (Table 2) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Table 2: Equivalent AUC Dosing Regimens 
Dosing and initial route of therapy (that is, IV or oral) for cUTI or pyelonephritis should be determined by the severity of the infection. CIPRO should be administered as described in Table 3.
Table 3: Pediatric Dosage Guidelines 
Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction. Dosage guidelines for use in patients with renal impairment are shown in Table 4.
Table 4: Recommended Starting and Maintenance Doses for Adult Patients with Impaired Renal Function 
When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formulas may be used to estimate creatinine clearance:

The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.
In patients with severe infections and severe renal impairment, a unit dose of 750 mg may be administered at the intervals noted above. Patients should be carefully monitored.
Pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were excluded from the clinical trial of cUTI and pyelonephritis. No information is available on dosing adjustments necessary for pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (that is, creatinine clearance of  <  50 mL/min/1.73m²).
Administer CIPRO at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium/aluminum antacids; polymeric phosphate binders (for example, sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate) or sucralfate; Videx®(didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder for oral solution; other highly buffered drugs; or other products containing calcium, iron or zinc.
Concomitant administration of CIPRO with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone should be avoided since decreased absorption is possible; however, CIPRO may be taken with a meal that contains these products.
Assure adequate hydration of patients receiving CIPRO to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine. Crystalluria has been reported with quinolones.
Instruct the patient of the appropriate CIPRO administration [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
CIPRO Oral Suspension is supplied in 5% (5 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) and 10% (10 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) strengths. CIPRO oral suspension is composed of two components (microcapsules and diluent) that must be combined prior to dispensing.
Table 5: Appropriate Dosing Volumes of the Reconstituted Oral Suspensions 
Preparation Of The Suspension:
 
The small bottle contains the microcapsules, the large bottle contains the diluent
 
Pour the microcapsules completely into the larger bottle of diluent. Do not add water to the suspension.
 
Open both bottles. Child-proof cap: Press down according to instructions oa the cap while turning to the left.
 
Remove the top layer of the diluent bottle label (to reveal the CIPRO Oral Suspension label). Close the large bottle completely according to the directions on the cap and shake   vigorously for about 15 seconds. The suspension is ready for use.
Write the expiration date of the re-constituted   oral suspension on the bottle label.
Reconstituted product may be stored below 30°C (86°F) for 14 days. Protect from freezing.
No additions should be made to the mixed final ciprofloxacin suspension. CIPRO Oral Suspension should not be administered through feeding or NG (nasogastric) tubes due to its physical characteristics.
