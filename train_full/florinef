Dosage depends on the severity of the disease and the response of the patient.    Patients should be continually monitored for signs that indicate dosage adjustment    is necessary, such as remissions or exacerbations of the disease and stress    (surgery, infection, trauma) (see WARNINGS and    PRECAUTIONS, General). 
In Addison's disease, the combination of Florinef Acetate (Fludrocortisone    Acetate Tablets USP) with a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone or cortisone    provides substitution therapy approximating normal adrenal activity with minimal    risks of unwanted effects.
The usual dose is 0.1 mg of Florinef (fludrocortisone)  Acetate daily, although dosage ranging    from 0.1 mg three times a week to 0.2 mg daily has been employed. In the event    transient hypertension develops as a consequence of therapy, the dose should    be reduced to 0.05 mg daily. Florinef (fludrocortisone)  Acetate is preferably administered in    conjunction with cortisone (10 mg to 37.5 mg daily in divided doses) or hydrocortisone    (10 mg to 30 mg daily in divided doses).
The recommended dosage for treating the salt-losing adrenogenital syndrome is 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg of Florinef (fludrocortisone)  Acetate daily.
