Therapy with this product should be limited to 10 consecutive days.
The external auditory canal should be thoroughly cleansed and dried with a sterile cotton applicator.
For adults, four drops of the solution should be instilled into the affected ear 3 or 4 times daily. For infants and children, three drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal.
The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then the drops should    be instilled. This position should be maintained for 5 minutes to facilitate    penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite    ear.
If preferred, a cotton wick may be inserted into the canal and then the cotton may be saturated with the solution. This wick should be kept moist by adding further solution every 4 hours. The wick should be replaced at least once every 24 hours.
