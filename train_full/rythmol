The dose of RYTHMOL must be individually titrated on the basis of response and tolerance. Initiate therapy with RYTHMOL 150 mg given every eight hours (450 mg/day). Dosage may be increased at a minimum of 3 to 4 day intervals to 225 mg every 8 hours (675 mg/day). If additional therapeutic effect is needed, the dose of RYTHMOL may be increased to 300 mg every 8 hours (900 mg/day). The usefulness and safety of dosages exceeding 900 mg per day have not been established.
In patients with hepatic impairment or thosewith significant widening of the QRS complex or second or third degree AV block, consider reducing the dose.
As with other antiarrhythmic agents, in the elderly or in ventricular arrhythmia patients with marked previous myocardial damage, the dose of RYTHMOL should be increased more gradually during the initial phase of treatment.
The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with the simultaneous administration of propafenone may significantly increase the concentration of propafenone and thereby increase the risk of proarrhythmia and other adverse events. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of RYTHMOL with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS].
