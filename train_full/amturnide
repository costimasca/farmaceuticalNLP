Dose once-daily. The dosage may be increased after 2 weeks of therapy. The maximum recommended dose of Amturnide is 300/10/25 mg.
Use Amturnide for patients not adequately controlled with any 2 of the following: aliskiren, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics.
Switch a patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions attributed to an individual component—while on any dual combination of the components of Amturnide—to Amturnide at a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.
For patients receiving aliskiren, amlodipine, and HCTZ from separate tablets, substitute Amturnide containing the same component doses.
Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking Amturnide, either with or without a meal. High-fat meals decrease absorption of aliskiren substantially [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
