Apply a thin layer of Lindane Lotion over all skin from the neck down. One    ounce is sufficient for an average adult. Do not prescribe more than 2 ounces    for larger adults. Apply only once. Wash off in 8 to 12 hours. Do not retreat.    (See BOXED WARNINGS.)
Patients should be provided specific information on use of product. (See PRECAUTIONS:    Information for Patients and the Medication Guide.)    Patients should be instructed on proper use of Lindane Lotion, especially the    amount to apply, how long to leave on and the need to avoid retreatment. Patients    should be informed that itching occurs after the successful killing of scabies    (lice) and continued itching is not necessarily an indication for retreatment    with Lindane Lotion.
A Lindane Lotion Medication Guide must be given to the patient each    time Lindane Lotion is dispensed, as required by law. The Lindane Lotion Medication    Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patient.
