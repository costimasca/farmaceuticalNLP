As with all blood products, patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes following administration of Rhophylac.
Rhophylac should be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection. If large doses (greater than 5 mL) are required and intramuscular injection is chosen, it is advisable to administer Rhophylac in divided doses at different sites.
Ensure the site of administration will allow the injection to reach the muscle if Rhophylac is administered intramuscularly. Consider intravenous administration if reaching the muscle is of concern [see Postmarketing Experience]. Do not administer Rhophylac subcutaneously into the fatty tissue.
Table 1 provides dosing guidelines based on the condition being treated.
Table 1: Dosing Guidelines for Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization 
For treatment of ITP, ADMINISTER RHOPHYLAC BY THE INTRAVENOUS ROUTE ONLY [see Preparation and Handling]. Do not administer intramuscularly. A 250 IU (50 mcg) per kg body weight dose of Rhophylac is recommended for patients with ITP. The following formula can be used to calculate the recommended amount of Rhophylac to administer:
Dose (IU) x body weight (kg) = Total IU / 1500 IU per syringe = Number of syringes
Rhophylac should be administered at a rate of 2 mL per 15 to 60 seconds.
