The dose of dipyridamole injection as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging should be adjusted according to the weight of the patient. The recommended dose is 0.142 mg/kg/minute (0.57 mg/kg total) infused over 4 minutes. Although the maximum tolerated dose has not been determined, clinical experience suggests that a total dose beyond 60 mg is not needed for any patient.
Prior to intravenous administration, dipyridamole injection should be diluted    in at least a 1:2 ratio with 0.45% sodium chloride injection, 0.9% sodium chloride    injection, or 5% dextrose injection for a total volume of approximately 20 to    50 mL. Infusion of undiluted dipyridamole injection may cause local irritation.
Thallium-201 should be injected within 5 minutes following the 4-minute infusion of dipyridamole. Do not mix dipyridamole injection with other drugs in the same syringe or infusion container.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, when-ever solution and container permit.
