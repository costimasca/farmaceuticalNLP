Apply a thin layer of Clobevate (clobetasol propionate gel)  to the affected areas twice daily and rub in    gently and completely (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).
Clobevate (clobetasol propionate gel)  is a super-high potency topical corticosteroid; therefore, treatment    should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks, and amounts greater than 50 g per    week should not be used.
As with other highly active corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
Clobevate (clobetasol propionate gel)  should not be used with occlusive dressings.
