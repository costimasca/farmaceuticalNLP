The recommended dose of XENICAL is one 120-mg capsule three times a day with each main meal containing fat (during or up to 1 hour after the meal).
The patient should be on a nutritionally balanced, reduced-calorie diet that contains approximately 30% of calories from fat. The daily intake of fat, carbohydrate, and protein should be distributed over three main meals. If a meal is occasionally missed or contains no fat, the dose of XENICAL can be omitted.
Because XENICAL has been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat-soluble vitamins and betacarotene, patients should be counseled to take a multivitamin containing fat-soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. The vitamin supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of XENICAL, such as at bedtime.
For patients receiving both XENICAL and cyclosporine therapy, administer cyclosporine 3 hours after XENICAL.
For patients receiving both XENICAL and levothyroxine therapy, administer levothyroxine and XENICAL at least 4 hours apart. Patients treated concomitantly with XENICAL and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function.
Doses above 120 mg three times a day have not been shown to provide additional benefit.
Based on fecal fat measurements, the effect of XENICAL is seen as soon as 24 to 48 hours after dosing. Upon discontinuation of therapy, fecal fat content usually returns to pretreatment levels within 48 to 72 hours.
