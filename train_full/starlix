StarlixÂ® (nateglinide) should be taken 1 to 30 minutes prior to meals.
The recommended starting and maintenance dose of Starlix, alone or in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione, is 120 mg three times daily before meals.
The 60-mg dose of Starlix, either alone or in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione, may be used in patients who are near goal HbA1C when treatment is initiated.
No special dose adjustments are usually necessary. However, greater sensitivity of some individuals to Starlix therapy cannot be ruled out.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild-to-severe renal insufficiency or in patients with mild hepatic insufficiency. Dosing of patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic dysfunction has not been studied. Therefore, Starlix should be used with caution in patients with moderate-to-severe liver disease (see PRECAUTIONS, Hepatic Impairment).
