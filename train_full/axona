Axona is taken orally once a day shortly after a full meal (preferably breakfast or lunch, whichever is more substantial). Patients should start with a graduated dosing regimen for 7 days, or as directed by the supervising healthcare provider, before taking one full packet (40 grams) per day (see  “PATIENT INFORMATION” for graduated dosing instructions). Axona should be added to 4 to 8 ounces (118 to 236 milliliters) of water or other liquids as preferred, and shaken or blended until fully mixed. A small minority of patients may require a more gradual dose titration.
