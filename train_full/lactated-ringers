This solution is for intravenous use only.
Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.
When a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally, it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle, placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation. Carefully avoid infiltration.
Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.
The presence of calcium ions in this solution should be considered when phosphate is present in additive solutions, in order to avoid precipitation.
Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
There is no specific pediatric dose. The dose is dependent on weight, clinical condition and laboratory results. See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.
