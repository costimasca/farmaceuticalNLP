Parenteral:
Intravenous: Dissolve 500,000 polymyxin B (polymyxin b sulfate)  units in 300 to 500 mL solutions    for parenteral dextrose injection 5% for continuous drip.
Adults and children: 15,000 to 25,000 units/kg body weight/day in individuals    with normal kidney function.This amount should be reduced from 15,000 units/kg    downward for individuals with kidney impairment. Infusions may be given every    12 hours; however, the total daily dose must not exceed 25,000 units/kg/day.
Infants:  Infants with normal kidney function may receive up to 40,000    units/kg/day without adverse effects.
Intramuscular:  Not recommended routinely because of severe pain at    injection sites, particularly in infants and children. Dissolve 500,000 polymyxin    B units in 2 mL sterile water for injection or sodium chloride injection or    procaine hydrochloride injection 1%.
Adults and children: 25,000 to 30,000 units/kg/day.This should be reduced    in the presence of renal impairment.The dosage may be divided and given at either    4 or 6 hour intervals.
Infants:  Infants with normal kidney function may receive up to 40,000    units/kg/day without adverse effects.
Note: Doses as high as 45,000 units/kg/day have been used in limited    clinical studies in treating prematures and newborn infants for sepsis caused    by Ps aeruginosa.
Intrathecal:  A treatment of choice for Ps aeruginosameningitis.    Dissolve 500,000 polymyxin B (polymyxin b sulfate)  units in 10 mL sodium chloride injection USP for    50,000 units per mL dosage unit.
Adults and children over 2 years of age: Dosage is 50,000 units once    daily intrathecally for 3 to 4 days, then 50,000 units once every other day    for at least 2 weeks after cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid are negative    and sugar content has returned to normal.
Children under 2 years of age: 20,000 units once daily, intrathecally    for 3 to 4 days or 25,000 units once every other day. Continue with a dose of    25,000 units once every other day for at least 2 weeks after cultures of the    cerebrospinal fluid are negative and sugar content has returned to normal.
IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY, SOLUTIONS OF PARENTERAL USE SHOULD BE STORED    UNDER REFRIGERATION, AND ANY UNUSED PORTIONS SHOULD BE DISCARDED AFTER 72 HOURS.
Ophthalmic: Dissolve 500,000 polymyxin B (polymyxin b sulfate)  units in 20 to 50 mL sterile    water for injection or sodium chloride injection USP for a 10,000 to 25,000    units per mL concentration.
For the treatment of Ps aeruginosa infections of the eye, a concentration    of 0.1 percent to 0.25 percent (10,000 units to 25,000 units per mL) is administered    1 to 3 drops every hour, increasing the intervals as response indicates.
Subconjunctival injection of up to 100,000 units/day may be used for the treatment    of Ps aeruginosa infections of the cornea and conjunctiva.
Note: Avoid total systemic and ophthalmic instillation over 25,000    units/kg/day.
