It is important that Promethazine HCl and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (promethazine and dextromethorphan)  Syrup    is measured with an accurate measuring device (see PRECAUTIONS-Information    for Patients). A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device    and could lead to overdosage, especially when half a teaspoon is to be measured.    It is strongly recommended that an accurate measuring device be used. A pharmacist    can provide an appropriate device and can provide instructions for measuring    the correct dose.
