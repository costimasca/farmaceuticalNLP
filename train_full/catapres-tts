Apply Catapres-TTS (clonidine)  transdermal therapeutic system once every 7 days to a hairless    area of intact skin on the upper outer arm or chest. Each new application of    Catapres-TTS (clonidine)  transdermal therapeutic system should be on a different skin site    from the previous location. If the system loosens during 7-day wearing, the    adhesive cover should be applied directly over the system to ensure good adhesion.    There have been rare reports of the need for patch changes prior to 7 days to    maintain blood pressure control.
To initiate therapy, Catapres-TTS (clonidine)  transdermal therapeutic system dosage should    be titrated according to individual therapeutic requirements, starting with    Catapres-TTS (clonidine) -1. If after one or two weeks the desired reduction in blood pressure    is not achieved, increase the dosage by adding another Catapres-TTS (clonidine) -1 or changing    to a larger system. An increase in dosage above two Catapres-TTS (clonidine) -3 is usually    not associated with additional efficacy.
When substituting Catapres-TTS transdermal therapeutic system for oral clonidine    or for other antihypertensive drugs, physicians should be aware that the antihypertensive    effect of Catapres-TTS (clonidine)  transdermal therapeutic system may not commence until    2-3 days after initial application. Therefore, gradual reduction of prior drug    dosage is advised. Some or all previous antihypertensive treatment may have    to be continued, particularly in patients with more severe forms of hypertension.
Dosage must be adjusted according to the degree of impairment, and patients    should be carefully monitored. Since only a minimal amount of clonidine is removed    during routine hemodialysis, there is no need to give supplemental clonidine    following dialysis.
