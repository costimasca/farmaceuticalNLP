Mitosol® is intended for topical application to the surgical site of glaucoma    filtration surgery. It is not intended for intraocular administration. If intraocular    administration occurs, cell death leading to corneal infarction, retinal infarction,    and ciliary body atrophy may result.
Method of Reconstitution: Each vial of Mitosol® contains 0.2 mg    of mitomycin and mannitol in a 1:2 concentration ratio. To reconstitute, add    1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, then shake to dissolve. If product does    not dissolve immediately, allow to stand at room temperature until the product    dissolves into solution.
Method of Use: Sponges provided within the Mitosol® Kit should be    fully saturated with the entire reconstituted contents in the manner prescribed    in the Instructions for Use. A treatment area approximating 10mm x 6mm +/- 2mm    should be treated with the Mitosol®. Apply fully saturated sponges equally    to the treatment area, in a single layer, with the use of a surgical forceps.    Keep the sponges on the treatment area for two (2) minutes, then remove and    return to the Mitosol® Tray for defined disposal in the Chemotherapy Waste    Bag provided.
Lyophilized Mitosol® stored at controlled room temperature (i.e.,    20 - 25°C or 68° - 77° F) is stable for the shelf life    indicated on the package. Avoid excessive heat. Protect from light.
Reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection at a concentration of    0.2 mg/ml, mitomycin is stable for one (1) hour at room temperature.
