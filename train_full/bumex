Dosage should be individualized with careful monitoring of patient response.
The usual total daily dosage of Bumex (bumetanide)  is 0.5 mg to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose.
If the diuretic response to an initial dose of Bumex (bumetanide)  is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4- to 5-hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby Bumex (bumetanide)  is given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema. In patients with hepatic failure, the dosage should be kept to a minimum and, if necessary, dosage increased very carefully.
Because cross-sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, Bumex (bumetanide)  can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of Bumex (bumetanide)  to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.
Bumetanide injection may be administered parenterally (IV or IM) to patients in whom gastrointestinal absorption may be impaired or in whom oral administration is not practical.
Parenteral treatment should be terminated and oral treatment instituted as soon as possible.
