The usual dosage of PROPINE® (dipivefrin)  is one drop in the eye(s) every 12 hours.
When patients are being transferred to PROPINE® (dipivefrin)  from antiglaucoma agents    other than epinephrine, on the first day continue the previous medication and    add one drop of PROPINE® (dipivefrin)  ophthalmic solution in each eye every 12 hours.    On the following day, discontinue the previously used antiglaucoma agent and    continue with PROPINE® (dipivefrin) .
In transferring patients from conventional epinephrine therapy to PROPINE® (dipivefrin)  ophthalmic solution, simply discontinue the epinephrine medication and institute the PROPINE® (dipivefrin)  regimen.
 When patients on other antiglaucoma agents require additional therapy, add    one drop of PROPINE® (dipivefrin)  every 12 hours.
 For difficult to control patients, the addition of PROPINE® (dipivefrin)  ophthalmic    solution to other agents such as pilocarpine, carbachol, echothiophate iodide    or acetazolamide has been shown to be effective.
