The use of CORTENEMA* hydrocortisone retention enema is predicated upon the    concomitant use of modem supportive measures such as rational dietary control,    sedatives, anldiarrheal agents, antibacterial therapy, blood replacement if    necessary, etc.
The usual course of therapy is one CORTENEMA (hydrocortisone) * nightly for 21 days, or until    the patient comes into remission both clinically and practologically. Clinical    symptoms usually subside promptly within 3 to 5 days. Improvement in appearance    of the mucosa, as seen by sigmoidoscope examination, may lag somewhat behind    clinical improvement. Difficult cases may require as long as 2 or 3 months of    CORTENEMA (hydrocortisone) * treatment. Where the course of therapy extends beyond 21 days, CORTENEMA (hydrocortisone) *    should be discontinued gradually by reducing administration to every other night    for 2 or 3 weeks.
If clinical or proctologic improvement fails to occur within 2 or 3 weeks after starting CORTENEMA® (hydrocortisone) , discontinue its use.
Symptomatic improvement, evidenced by decreased diarrhea and bleeding; weight    gain; improved appetite; lessened fever; and decrease in leukocytosis, may be    misleading and should not be used as the sole criterion in judging efficacy.    Sigmoidoscopic examination and X-ray visualization are essential for adequate    monitoring of ulcerative colitis. Biopsy is useful for differential diagnosis.    Patient instructions for administering CORTENEMA® (hydrocortisone)  are enclosed in each box.    It is recommended that the patient lie on their left side during administration    and for 30 minutes thereafter, so that the fluid will distribute throughout    the left colon. Every effort should be made to retain the enema for at least    an hour and preferably, all night. This may be facilitated by prior sedation    and/or antidianheal medication, especially early in therapy when the urge to    evacuate is great.
