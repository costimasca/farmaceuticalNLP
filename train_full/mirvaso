Apply a pea-sized amount once daily to each of the five areas of the face: central forehead, chin, nose, each cheek. MIRVASO topical gel should be applied smoothly and evenly as a thin layer across the entire face avoiding the eyes and lips.
Wash hands after applying MIRVASO topical gel.
MIRVASO topical gel is for topical use only and not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
