When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin    should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without    a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with    a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration    consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients    should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month    to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary. (See BOXED    WARNINGS and WARNINGS.) For women    who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling,    when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed    persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.
For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause in patients not improved by estrogen alone.
The lowest dose that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible.
Administration should be cyclic (e.g., three weeks on and one week off).  Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at three- to six-month intervals.
1 tablet of ESTRATEST (esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone)  or 1 to 2 tablets of ESTRATEST (esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone)  H.S. daily as recommended by the physician.
Treated patients with an intact uterus should be monitored closely for signs of endometrial cancer and appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy in the event of persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.
