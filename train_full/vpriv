VPRIV should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The recommended starting VPRIV dosage in naïve adults and naïve pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is 60 Units/kg administered every other week as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The dosage can be adjusted based on achievement and maintenance of each patient's therapeutic goals.
Adults and pediatric patients 4 years of age and older currently being treated on a stable dosage of imiglucerase for type 1 Gaucher disease may be switched to VPRIV by starting treatment with VPRIV at the previous imiglucerase dosage two weeks after the last imiglucerase dose. VPRIV should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The dosage can be adjusted based on achievement and maintenance of each patient's therapeutic goals.
VPRIV is a lyophilized powder, which requires reconstitution and dilution, using sterile technique, prior to intravenous infusion. VPRIV should be prepared as follows:
Administer the diluted VPRIV solution through an in-line low protein-binding 0.2μm filter over 60 minutes. Do not infuse VPRIV with other products in the same infusion tubing because the compatibility of a VPRIV solution with other products has not been evaluated.
Consider pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids in patients who exhibited symptoms of hypersensitivity associated with prior VPRIV infusions. Appropriate medical support should be readily available when VPRIV is administered [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
