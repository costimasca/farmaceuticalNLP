Selection of the appropriate dosage strength (Auvi-Q 0.3 mg or Auvi-Q 0.15 mg) is determined according to patient body weight.
Inject Auvi-Q intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, through clothing if necessary. Instruct caregivers of young children who are prescribed Auvi-Q and who may be uncooperative and kick or move during an injection to hold the childâ€™s leg firmly in place and limit movement prior to and during an injection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Each Auvi-Q contains a single dose of epinephrine for single-use injection. Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from Auvi-Q are fixed, consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0.15 mg are deemed necessary.
The prescriber should carefully assess each patient to determine the most appropriate dose of epinephrine, recognizing the life-threatening nature of the reactions for which this drug is indicated. With severe persistent anaphylaxis, repeat injections with an additional Auvi-Q may be necessary. More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The epinephrine solution in the viewing window of Auvi-Q should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration. Epinephrine is light sensitive and should be stored in the outer case provided to protect it from light [see Storage And Handling].
