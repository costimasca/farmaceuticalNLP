The recommended starting dose of FARXIGA is 5 mg once daily, taken in the morning, with or without food. In patients tolerating FARXIGA 5 mg once daily who require additional glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 10 mg once daily.
In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of FARXIGA is recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, and PATIENT INFORMATION].
Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of FARXIGA therapy and periodically thereafter.
Initiation of FARXIGA is not recommended in patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 .
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater).
Use of FARXIGA is not recommended in patients with an eGFR persistently between 30 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use In Specific Populations].
FARXIGA is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].
