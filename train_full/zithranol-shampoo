Zithranol Shampoo should be applied onto wet scalp 3 to 4 times per week (or as directed by the physician). Lather and leave on scalp for 3 to 5 minutes and then rinse thoroughly. Avoid contact with eyes. Although no additional shampoo is necessary to cleanse the hair, a non-medicated shampoo or conditioner can be applied following the use of Zithranol Shampoo, if desired. If no improvement is seen after 4 weeks of treatment, consult the physician.
