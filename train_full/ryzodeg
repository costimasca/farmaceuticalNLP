The recommended starting dose of RYZODEG 70/30 in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be administered as a short- or rapid-acting insulin divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The recommended starting dose of RYZODEG 70/30 in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is 10 units once daily.
