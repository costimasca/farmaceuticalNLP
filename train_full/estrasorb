For topical use only. ESTRASORB is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. ESTRASORB should not be applied to the face or breasts.
Generally, when estrogen therapy is prescribed for a  postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of  endometriosis may need a progestin.
Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual women. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate.
The single approved dose of ESTRASORB is 3.48 grams daily. Apply one pouch (1.74 grams) to the left thigh and calf and one pouch (1.74 grams) to the right thigh and calf each morning. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3 to 6 month intervals.
The lowest effective dose of ESTRASORB for this indication has not been determined.
