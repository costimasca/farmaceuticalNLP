OXISTAT (oxiconazole)  Cream or Lotion should be applied to affected and immediately surrounding   areas once to twice daily in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis, or tinea   cruris. OXISTAT (oxiconazole)  Cream should be applied once daily in the treatment of tinea   (pityriasis) versicolor. Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea (pityriasis)   versicolor should be treated for 2 weeks and tinea pedis for 1 month to reduce   the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after   the treatment period, the diagnosis should be reviewed. 
Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented    patches on the trunk that may extend to the neck, arms, and upper thighs. Treatment   of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the   affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable   and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure.   Although tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because   the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora.
