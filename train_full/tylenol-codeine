Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the    patient.
The usual adult dosage is:
  
Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.
The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum    number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information    should be conveyed in the prescription.
It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with    continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult    doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain    but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased    incidence of undesirable side effects. Equivalently high doses in children would    have similar effects.
