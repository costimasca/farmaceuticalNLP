For intravenous use after reconstitution only.
The dose to achieve a desired in vivo peak increase in Factor X level may be calculated using the following formula:
Dose (IU) = Body Weight (kg) x Desired Factor X Rise (IU/dL) x 0.5
Note: The desired Factor X rise is the difference between the patient's plasma Factor X level and the desired level. The dosing formula is based on the observed recovery of 2 IU/dL per IU/kg.
Infuse 25 IU/kg of COAGADEX when the first sign of bleeding occurs. Repeat at intervals of 24 hours until the bleed stops.
Measure post-infusion plasma Factor X levels for each patient before and after surgery, to ensure that hemostatic levels are obtained and maintained.
Pre-surgery: Calculate the dose of COAGADEX to raise plasma Factor X levels to 70-90 IU/dL using the following formula:
Required dose (IU) = Body Weight (kg) x Desired Factor X Rise (IU/dL) x 0.5
Post-surgery: Repeat dose as necessary to maintain plasma Factor X levels at a minimum of 50 IU/dL until the patient is no longer at risk of bleeding due to surgery.
The procedures below are provided as general guidelines for the preparation and reconstitution of COAGADEX.
