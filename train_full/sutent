The recommended dose of SUTENT for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one 50 mg oral dose taken once daily, on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off (Schedule 4/2). SUTENT may be taken with or without food.
The recommended dose of SUTENT for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) is 37.5 mg taken orally once daily continuously without a scheduled off-treatment period. SUTENT may be taken with or without food.
Dose interruption and/or dose modification in 12.5 mg increments or decrements is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. The maximum dose administered in the Phase 3 pNET study was 50 mg daily.
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole may increas e sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential is recommended. A dose reduction for SUTENT to a minimum of 37.5 mg (GIST and RCC) or 25 mg (pNET) daily should be considered if SUTENT must be co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decreas e sunitinib plasma concentrations. Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential is recommended. A dose increase for SUTENT to a maximum of 87.5 mg (GIST and RCC) or 62.5 mg (pNET) daily should be considered if SUTENT must be co-administered with a CYP3A4 inducer. If dose is increased, the patient should be monitored carefully for toxicity [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
