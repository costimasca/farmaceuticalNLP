Systemic sulfonamides are contraindicated in pediatric patients under 2 months of age, except in the treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis as adjunctive therapy with pyrimethamine.
The usual dosage schedules are as follows:
Severe Infections: 4 tablets (2 g) initially, followed by 2 tablets (1 g) three times daily thereafter.
Patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance below 20 to 30 mL/min) require decreased dosage adjustment.
