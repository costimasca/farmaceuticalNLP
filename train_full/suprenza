The usual adult dose is one tablet as prescribed by the physician, administered in the morning, with or without food. Suprenza is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than or equal to 16 years of age.
Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.
With dry hands, gently remove the Suprenza (phentermine hydrochloride ODT) tablet from the bottle. Immediately place the Suprenza tablet on top of the tongue where it will dissolve, then swallow with or without water.
