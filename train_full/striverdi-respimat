The recommended dose of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is two inhalations once-daily at the same time of the day. Do not use STRIVERDI RESPIMAT more than two inhalations every 24 hours.
Prior to first use, the STRIVERDI RESPIMAT cartridge is inserted into the STRIVERDI RESPIMAT inhaler and the unit is primed. When using the unit for the first time, patients are to actuate the inhaler toward the ground until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times. The unit is then considered primed and ready for use. If not used for more than 3 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler once to prepare the inhaler for use. If not used for more than 21 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times to prepare the inhaler for use [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
No dosage adjustment is required for geriatric patients, patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, or renally-impaired patients. There are no data available for use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in severe hepatically impaired patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
