The recommended dosage for patients six years of age and older is to administer one single-use ampule (300 mg/4 mL) twice daily by oral inhalation in repeated cycles of 28 days on drug, followed by 28 days off drug. The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible and not less than 6 hours apart.
The 300 mg/4 mL dose of BETHKIS is the same for patients regardless of age or weight. BETHKIS has not been studied in patients less than six years old.
BETHKIS is administered by oral inhalation. Do not use by any other route.
BETHKIS is administered by inhalation using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a PARI Vios Air compressor over an approximately 15 minute period and until sputtering from the output of the nebulizer has occurred for at least one minute.
Further patient instructions on how to administer BETHKIS are provided in the PATIENT  INFORMATION.
