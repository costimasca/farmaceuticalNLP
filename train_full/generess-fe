To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, GENERESS Fe must be taken exactly   as directed. Chew and swallow one tablet without water at the same time every   day. Tablets must be taken in the order directed on the blister pack. Tablets   should not be skipped or taken at intervals exceeding 24 hours. For patient   instructions for missed pills, see FDA-Approved Patient Labeling. GENERESS Fe   may be administered without regard to meals [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Instruct the patient to begin taking GENERESS Fe on Day 1 of her menstrual   cycle (that is, the first day of her menstrual bleeding). One light green tablet   should be taken daily for 24 consecutive days followed by one brown tablet daily   for 4 consecutive days. [See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling.] Instruct   the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first   7 days if she starts taking GENERESS Fe other than on the first day of her menstrual   cycle.
For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion,   GENERESS Fe may be started no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum.

The possibility   of ovulation and conception before starting COCs should also be considered.
