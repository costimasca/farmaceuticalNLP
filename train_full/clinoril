Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of CLINORIL (sulindac)  and other treatment    options before deciding to use CLINORIL (sulindac) . Use the lowest effective dose for the    shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).
After observing the response to initial therapy with CLINORIL (sulindac) , the dose and    frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
CLINORIL (sulindac)  should be administered orally twice a day with food. The maximum dosage    is 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended.
In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended    starting dosage is 150 mg twice a day. The dosage may be lowered or raised depending    on the response.
A prompt response (within one week) can be expected in about one-half of patients    with osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Others    may require longer to respond.
In acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis)    and acute gouty arthritis, the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day. After    a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced according    to the response. In acute painful shoulder, therapy for 714 days is usually    adequate. In acute gouty arthritis, therapy for 7 days is usually adequate.
