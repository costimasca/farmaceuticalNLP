Synvisc-One combines the three doses of SYNVISC (hylan G-F 20) which consists of hylan A (average molecular weight 6,000,000 daltons) and hylan B hydrated gel in a buffered physiological sodium chloride solution, pH 7.2. Synvisc-One has an elasticity (storage modulus G') at 2.5 Hz of 111 ± 13 Pascals (Pa) and a viscosity (loss modulus G“) of 25 ± 2 Pa (elasticity and viscosity of knee synovial fluid of 18 to 27- year-old humans measured with a comparable method at 2.5 Hz: G' = 117 ± 13 Pa; G” = 45 ± 8 Pa.)
Each 10 mL syringe of Synvisc-One combines the three 2-mL doses (16 mg each) of a complete SYNVISC treatment regimen (48 mg). Each Synvisc-One 10-mL syringe contains:
