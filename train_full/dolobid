Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of DOLOBID (diflunisal)  and other treatment    options before deciding to use DOLOBID (diflunisal) . Use the lowest effective dose for the    shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).  
After observing the response to initial therapy with DOLOBID (diflunisal) , the dose and    frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
Concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics prevail when DOLOBID (diflunisal)  is administered;    a doubling of dosage produces a greater than doubling of drug accumulation.    The effect becomes more apparent with repetitive doses.
For mild to moderate pain, an initial dose of 1000 mg followed by 500 mg every    12 hours is recommended for most patients. Following the initial dose, some    patients may require 500 mg every 8 hours.
A lower dosage may be appropriate depending on such factors as pain severity,    patient response, weight, or advanced age; for example, 500 mg initially, followed    by 250 mg every 8-12 hours.
For osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, the suggested dosage range is    500 mg to 1000 mg daily in two divided doses. The dosage of DOLOBID (diflunisal)  may be increased    or decreased according to patient response.
Maintenance doses higher than 1500 mg a day are not recommended.
Tablets should be swallowed whole, not crushed or chewed.
