The usual dietary intake of potassium by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq    per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires    the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for    the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses    of 40-100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion.    Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more    than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.
