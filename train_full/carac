Carac (fluorouracil)  cream should be applied once a day to the skin where actinic keratosis    lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire area with a thin film. Carac (fluorouracil)    cream should not be applied near the eyes, nostrils or mouth. Carac (fluorouracil)  cream should   be applied ten minutes after thoroughly washing, rinsing, and drying the entire   area. Carac (fluorouracil)  cream may be applied using the fingertips. Immediately after application,   the hands should be thoroughly washed. Carac (fluorouracil)  should be applied up to 4 weeks   as tolerated. Continued treatment up to 4 weeks results in greater lesion reduction.   Local irritation is not markedly increased by extending treatment from 2 to   4 weeks, and is generally resolved within 2 weeks of cessation of treatment.
