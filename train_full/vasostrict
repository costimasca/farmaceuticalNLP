Dilute Vasostrict in normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or 5% dextrose in water (D5W) prior to use. Discard unused diluted solution after 18 hours at room temperature or 24 hours under refrigeration.

Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use, whenever solution and container permit.
The goal of treatment is optimization of perfusion to critical organs, but aggressive treatment can compromise perfusion of organs, like the gastrointestinal tract, whose function is difficult to monitor. The following advice is empirical. In general, titrate to the lowest dose compatible with a clinically acceptable response.
For post-cardiotomy shock, start with a dose of 0.03 units/minute. For septic shock, start with a dose of 0.01 units/minute. If the target blood pressure response is not achieved, titrate up by 0.005 units/minute at 10- to 15-minute intervals. The maximum dose for post-cardiotomy shock is 0.1 units/minute and for septic shock 0.07 units/minute. After target blood pressure has been maintained for 8 hours without the use of catecholamines, taper Vasostrict by 0.005 units/minute every hour as tolerated to maintain target blood pressure.
