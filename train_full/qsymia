Determine the patient's BMI. BMI is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by height (in meters) squared. A BMI conversion chart (Table 1) based on height [inches (in) or centimeters (cm)] and weight [pounds (lb) or kilograms (kg)] is provided below.
Table 1: BMI Conversion Chart 
In adults with an initial BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater or 27 kg/m² or greater when accompanied by weight-related co-morbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia prescribe Qsymia as follows:
In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance [CrCl] greater than or equal to 30 and less than 50 mL/min) or severe (CrCl less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment dosing should not exceed Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg once daily. Renal impairment is determined by calculating CrCl using the Cockcroft-Gault equation with actual body weight [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 -9), dosing should not exceed Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg once daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSand CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
