In psychoneurotic patients whose anxiety and depression warrant combined therapy, one ETRAFON (perphenazine and amitriptyline)  Tablet (2-25) or one ETRAFON (perphenazine and amitriptyline) -Forte Tablet (4-25) three or four times a day is recommended. 
In elderly patients and adolescents, a lower initial dosage may be needed. The dosage may then be adjusted cautiously to produce an adequate response. 
In more severely ill patients with schizophrenia, two ETRAFON (perphenazine and amitriptyline) -Forte Tablets (4-25) three times a day are recommended as the initial dosage. If necessary, a fourth dose may be given at bedtime. The total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets of any strength. 
Depending on the condition being treated, the onset of therapeutic response may vary from a few days to a few weeks or even longer. After a satisfactory response is noted, dosage should be reduced to the smallest dose which is effective for relief of the symptoms for which ETRAFON (perphenazine and amitriptyline)  Tablets are being administered. A useful maintenance dosage is one ETRAFON (perphenazine and amitriptyline)  Tablet (2-25) or one ETRAFON (perphenazine and amitriptyline) -Forte Tablet (4-25) two to four times a day. In some patients, maintenance dosage is required for many months. 
ETRAFON 2-10 Tablets (2-10) can be used to increase flexibility in adjusting maintenance dosage to the lowest amount consistent with relief of symptoms.
