The recommended dose of DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)  is one 3 mL vial administered 4 times per day   via nebulization with up to 2 additional 3 mL doses allowed per day, if needed.   Safety and efficacy of additional doses or increased frequency of administration   of DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)  beyond these guidelines has not been studied and the safety and efficacy   of extra doses of albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide in addition to the   recommended doses of DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)  have not been studied.
The use of DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)  can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring   bouts of bronchospasm. If a previously effective regimen fails to provide the   usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often   a sign of worsening COPD, which would require reassessment of therapy.
A Pari-LC-Plus™ nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to   a PRONEB™ compressor was used to deliver DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)  to each patient in one   U.S. clinical study. The safety and efficacy of DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)  delivered by other nebulizers   and compressors have not been established.
DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)  should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor   with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask.
