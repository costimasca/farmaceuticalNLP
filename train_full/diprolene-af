Apply a thin film of DIPROLENE AF Cream to the affected skin areas once or twice daily.
Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. DIPROLENE AF Cream is a highpotency corticosteroid. Treatment with DIPROLENE AF Cream should not exceed 50 g per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
DIPROLENE AF Cream should not be used with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.
DIPROLENE AF Cream is for topical use only. It is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.Â  Avoid use on the face, groin, or axillae, or if skin atrophy is present at the treatment site.
