Table I. Dosage for postanesthetic use—I.V. and infusion. 
(See Table I. Dosage for postanesthetic use—I.V.)
The recommended dose for I.V. administration is 0.5 – 1 mg/kg for a single injection and at 5-minute intervals. Careful observation of the patient during administration and for some time subsequently are advisable. The ma ximum total dosage by I.V. injection is 2 mg/kg.
The solution is prepared by adding 250 mg of doxapram (12.5 mL) to 250 mL of dextrose 5% or 10% in water or normal saline solution. The infusion is initiated at a rate of approximately 5 mg/minute until a satisfactory respiratory response is observed, and maintained at a rate of 1 to 3 mg/minute. The rate of infusion should be adjusted to sustain the desired level of respiratory stimulation with a minimum of side effects. The maximum total dosage by infusion is 4 mg/kg, or approximately 300 mg for the average adult.

Table II. Dosage for drug-induced CNS depression. 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
Doxapram hydrochloride is compatible with 5% and 10% dextrose in water or normal saline.
ADMIXTURE OF DOXAPRAM WITH ALKALINE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS 2.5% THIOPENTAL SODIUM, SODIUM BICARBONATE, FUROSEMIDE, OR AMINOPHYLLINE WILL RESULT IN PRECIPITATION OR GAS FORMATION.
Doxapram is also not compatible with ascorbic acid, cefoperazone sodium, cefotaxime sodium, cefotetan sodium, cefuroxime sodium, folic acid, dexamethasone disodium phosphate, diazepam, hydrocortisone sodium phospate, methylprednisolone sodium, or hydrocortisone sodium succinate.
Admixture of doxapram and ticarcillin disodium results in an 18% loss of doxapram in 3 hours. When doxapram is mixed with minocycline hydrochloride, there is a loss of 8% of doxapram in 3 hours and a 13% loss of doxapram in 6 hours.
