The recommended once-daily doses of Tekturna HCT in order of increasing mean effect are 150/12.5 mg, 150/25 mg or 300/12.5 mg, and 300/25 mg.
The antihypertensive effect of Tekturna HCT is largely manifested within 1 week, with maximal effects generally seen at around 4 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of aliskiren 300 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg.
A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to combination therapy with Tekturna HCT. The usual recommended starting dose is 150/12.5 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The dose may be titrated up to a maximum of aliskiren 300 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily.
Tekturna HCT may be substituted for the individually titrated components.
The usual recommended starting dose is 150/12.5 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The dose may be titrated up to a maximum of aliskiren 300 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily. Tekturna HCT is not recommended for use as initial therapy in patients with intravascular volume depletion [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Tekturna HCT may be administered with some other antihypertensive agents. In diabetics, do not use in combination with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitors (ACEIs) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. Concomitant use of aliskiren with an ARB or ACEI is not recommended in patients with GFR  < 60 ml/min [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. There are no data available with use of Tekturna HCT with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta blockers [see Clinical Studies].
Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking Tekturna HCT with regard to meals. High-fat meals decrease absorption  substantially [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
