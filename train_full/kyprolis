For the combination regimen with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, administer Kyprolis intravenously as a 10-minute infusion on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks followed by a 12-day rest period as shown in Table 1. Each 28-day period is considered one treatment cycle. The recommended starting dose of Kyprolis is 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2. If tolerated, escalate the dose to 27 mg/m2 on Day 8 of Cycle 1. From Cycle 13, omit the Day 8 and 9 doses of Kyprolis. Discontinue Kyprolis after Cycle 18. Lenalidomide 25 mg is taken orally on Days 1–21 and dexamethasone 40 mg by mouth or intravenously on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the 28-day cycles.
Table 1: Kyprolis (10-Minute Infusion) in Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone 
Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs [see Dose Modifications Based On Toxicities]. Refer to the lenalidomide and dexamethasone Prescribing Information for other concomitant medications, such as the use of anticoagulant and antacid prophylaxis, that may be required with those agents.
For the combination regimen with dexamethasone, administer Kyprolis intravenously as a 30-minute infusion on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks followed by a 12-day rest period as shown in Table 2. Each 28-day period is considered one treatment cycle. Administer Kyprolis by 30-minute infusion at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2. If tolerated, escalate the dose to 56 mg/m2 on Day 8 of Cycle 1. Dexamethasone 20 mg is taken by mouth or intravenously on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of each 28-day cycle. Administer dexamethasone 30 minutes to 4 hours before Kyprolis.

Treatment may be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs [seeDose Modifications Based On Toxicities]. Refer to the dexamethasone Prescribing Information for other concomitant medications.
For monotherapy, administer Kyprolis intravenously as a 10-minute or 30-minute infusion depending on the regimen as described below.
20/27 mg/m2 regimen by 10-minute infusion
For monotherapy using the 20/27 mg/m2 regimen, administer Kyprolis intravenously as a 10-minute infusion [see Clinical Studies]. In Cycles 1 through 12, administer Kyprolis on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks followed by a 12-day rest period as shown in Table 3. Each 28-day period is considered one treatment cycle. From Cycle 13, omit the Day 8 and 9 doses of Kyprolis (see Table 3). Premedicate with dexamethasone 4 mg orally or intravenously 30 minutes to 4 hours before each Kyprolis dose in Cycle 1, then as needed to help prevent infusion reactions [see Administration Precautions]. The recommended starting dose of Kyprolis is 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2. If tolerated, escalate the dose to 27 mg/m2 on Day 8 of Cycle 1. Treatment may continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

20/56 mg/m2 regimen by 30-minute infusion
For monotherapy using the 20/56 mg/m2 regimen, administer Kyprolis intravenously as a 30-minute infusion [see Clinical Studies]. In Cycles 1 through 12, administer Kyprolis on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks followed by a 12-day rest period as shown in Table 4. Each 28-day period is considered one treatment cycle. From Cycle 13, omit the Day 8 and 9 doses of Kyprolis (see Table 4). Premedicate with dexamethasone 8 mg orally or intravenously 30 minutes to 4 hours before each Kyprolis dose in Cycle 1, then as needed to help prevent infusion reactions [see Administration Precautions]. The recommended starting dose of Kyprolis is 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2. If tolerated, escalate the dose to 56 mg/m2 on Day 8 of Cycle 1. Treatment may continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

Modify dosing based on toxicity. Recommended actions and dose modifications for Kyprolis are presented in Table 5. Dose level reductions are presented in Table 6. See the lenalidomide and dexamethasone Prescribing Information respectively for dosing recommendations.
Table 5: Dose Modifications for Toxicitya during Kyprolis Treatment 
Table 6: Dose Level Reductions for Kyprolis 
For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, reduce the dose of Kyprolis by 25%. Dosing recommendation cannot be made in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
For patients with end stage renal disease who are on dialysis, administer Kyprolis after the hemodialysis procedure.
Kyprolis vials contain no antimicrobial preservatives and are intended for single use only. Unopened vials of Kyprolis are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored in the original package at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). The reconstituted solution contains carfilzomib at a concentration of 2 mg/mL.
Read the complete preparation instructions prior to reconstitution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

The stabilities of reconstituted Kyprolis under various temperature and container conditions are shown in Table 7.
