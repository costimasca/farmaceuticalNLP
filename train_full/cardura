The recommended initial dosage of CARDURA is 1 mg given once daily either in the morning or evening.
Depending on the individual patient's urodynamics and BPH symptomatology, the dose may be titrated at 1 to 2 week intervals to 2 mg, and thereafter to 4 mg and 8 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose for BPH is 8 mg once daily.
Routinely monitor blood pressure in these patients.
The initial dosage of CARDURA is 1 mg given once daily. Daily dosage may be doubled up 16 mg once daily, as needed, to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure.
