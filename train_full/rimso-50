Instillation of 50 mL of RIMSO-50® brand of dimethyl sulfoxide directly    into the bladder may be accomplished by catheter or syringe and allow to remain    for 15 minutes. Application of an analgesic lubricant gel such as lidocaine    jelly to the urethra is suggested prior to insertion of the catheter to avoid    spasm. The medication is expelled by spontaneous voiding.
It is recommended that the treatment be repeated every two weeks until maximum symptomatic relief is obtained. Thereafter, time intervals between therapy may be increased appropriately.
Administration of oral analgesic medication suppositories containing belladonna and opium prior to the instillation of RIMSO-50® (dmso)  solution can reduce bladder spasm.
In patients with severe interstitial cystitis with very sensitive bladders, the initial treatment, and possibly the second and third (depending on patient response) should be done under anesthesia. (Saddle block has been suggested.)
