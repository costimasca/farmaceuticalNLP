(See INDICATIONS AND USAGE for indicated pathogens.)
VANTIN Tablets should be administered orally with food to enhance absorption. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
The recommended dosages, durations of treatment, and applicable patient population are as described in the following chart:
 
VANTIN Oral Suspension may be given without regard to food. The recommended dosages, durations of treatment, and applicable patient populations are as described in the following chart:
 
 
For patients with severe renal impairment ( < 30 mL/min creatinine clearance), the dosing intervals should be increased to Q 24 hours. In patients maintained on hemodialysis, the dose frequency should be 3 times/week after hemodialysis.
When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to estimate creatinine clearance (mL/min). For this estimate to be valid, the serum creatinine level should represent a steady state of renal function.
Males(mL/min): Weight (kg) x (140 - age)/ 72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)
Females(mL/min): 0.85 x above value
Cefpodoxime pharmacokinetics in cirrhotic patients (with or without ascites) are similar to those in healthy subjects. Dose adjustment is not necessary in this population.
