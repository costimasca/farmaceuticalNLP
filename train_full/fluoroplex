The patient should be instructed to apply sufficient medication to cover the entire face or other affected areas.
Apply medication twice daily with fingertips and wash hands afterwards. A treatment period of 2-6 weeks is usually required.
Increasing the frequency of application and a longer period of administration with FLUOROPLEX® (fluorouracil topical cream)  Cream may be required on areas other than the head and neck.
When FLUOROPLEX® (fluorouracil topical cream)  Cream is applied to keratotic skin, a response occurs with the following sequence: erythema, usually followed by scaling, tenderness, erosion, ulceration, necrosis and re-epithelization. When the inflammatory reaction reaches the erosion, ulceration and necrosis stages, the use of the drug should be terminated. Responses may sometimes occur in areas which appear clinically normal. These may be sites of subclinical actinic (solar) keratosis which the medication is affecting.
