When administered with VIEKIRA PAK, the recommended dosage of RBV is based on weight: 1000 mg/day for subjects  < 75 kg and 1200 mg/day for those  ≥ 75 kg, divided and administered twice-daily with food.

In liver transplant recipients with normal hepatic function and mild fibrosis (Metavir fibrosis score 2 or lower), the recommended duration of VIEKIRA PAK with ribavirin is 24 weeks, irrespective of HCV genotype 1 subtype [see  Clinical Studies]. When VIEKIRA PAK is administered with calcineurin inhibitors in liver transplant recipients, dosage adjustment of calcineurin inhibitors is needed [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
VIEKIRA PAK is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS,  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use in Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
