The wounds or ulcers should be cleaned and disinfected prior to treatment.    In the event of long-standing ulcers, it may be advisable to clean and/or to    debride the wound by surgical or enzymatic means, prior to treatment. Apply    a thin layer of BIONECTÂ® without extensive rubbing onto the wound surface,    two or three times per day. Cover the lesion area with a sterile gauze pad and,    if necessary, with an elastic or compressive bandage.
