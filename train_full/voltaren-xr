Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Voltaren速-XR (diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets)  (diclofenac   sodium extended-release) tablets, USP and other treatment options before deciding   to use Voltaren-XR. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration   consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).
After observing the response to initial therapy with Voltaren-XR, the dose   and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
For the relief of osteoarthritis, the recommended dosage is 100 mg q.d.
For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended dosage is 100 mg q.d.   In the rare patient where Voltaren-XR 100 mg/day is unsatisfactory, the dose   may be increased to 100 mg b.i.d. if the benefits outweigh the clinical risks   of increased side effects.
Different formulations of diclofenac [Voltaren速 (diclofenac sodium enteric-coated    tablets); Voltaren速-XR (diclofenac sodium extended-release) tablets, USP;   Cataflam速 (diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets)] are not necessarily   bioequivalent even if the milligram strength is the same.
