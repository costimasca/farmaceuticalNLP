BONIVA Injection must be administered intravenously only by a health care professional. Care must be taken not to administer intra-arterially or paravenously as this could lead to tissue damage [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended dose of BONIVA Injection for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis is 3 mg every 3 months administered intravenously over a period of 15 to 30 seconds. Do not administer more frequently than once every 3 months.
Prior to administration of each dose obtain a serum creatinine [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Given that bisphosphonates have been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), perform a routine oral examination prior to administration of BONIVA Injection.
Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and  vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
If the dose is missed, administer as soon as it can be re-scheduled. Thereafter, BONIVA Injection should be scheduled every 3 months from the date of the last injection.
Do not administer to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
