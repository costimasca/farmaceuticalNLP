Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Trilipix, and should continue this diet during treatment. Trilipix delayed release capsules can be taken without regard to meals. Patients should be advised to swallow Trilipix capsules whole. Do not open, crush, dissolve, or chew capsules. Serum lipids should be monitored periodically.
The initial dose of Trilipix is 45 to 135 mg once daily. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.
The dose of Trilipix is 135 mg once daily.
Treatment with Trilipix should be initiated at a dose of 45 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and should only be increased after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of Trilipix should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations].
