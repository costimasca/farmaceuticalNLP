This package contains Novolin® N in an InnoLet® disposable prefilled insulin syringe. Novolin N is commonly known as NPH, Human Insulin Isophane Suspension (recombinant DNA origin). The concentration of this product is 100 units of insulin per milliliter. It is a cloudy or milky suspension of human insulin with protamine and zinc. The insulin substance (the cloudy material) settles at the bottom of the insulin reservoir, therefore, the Novolin N InnoLet (nph, human insulin isophane suspension 3 ml disposable prefilled syringe)  must be rotated up and down so that the contents are uniformly mixed before a dose is given. Novolin N has an intermediate duration of action. The effect of Novolin N begins approximately 1½ hours after injection. The effect is maximal between 4 and 12 hours. The full duration of action may last up to 24 hours after injection.
