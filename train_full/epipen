Selection of the appropriate dosage strength (EpiPen 0.3 mg or EpiPen Jr 0.15 mg) is determined according to patient body weight.
Inject EpiPen or EpiPen Jr intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, through clothing if necessary. Instruct caregivers of young children who are prescribed an EpiPen or EpiPen Jr and who may be uncooperative and kick or move during an injection to hold the leg firmly in place and limit movement prior to and during an injection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Each EpiPen or EpiPen Jr contains a single dose of  epinephrine for single-use injection. Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from EpiPen or EpiPen Jr are fixed, consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0.15 mg are deemed necessary.
The prescriber should carefully assess each patient to determine the most appropriate dose of epinephrine, recognizing the life-threatening nature of the reactions for which this drug is indicated. Wit h severe persist ent anaph yl ax is , repeat injections with an additional EpiP en or EpiPen Jr ma y be necessary. More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The epinephrine solution in the clear window of t he EpiPen Auto-Injector should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration. Epinephrine is light sensitive and should be stored in the carrier tube provided to protect it from light [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling].
