Severely indurated, sharply marginated and very  superficial wrinkles may be difficult to distend and, therefore, are difficult to correct. If a defect cannot be distended because of extensive scarring or non-elastic tissue, the course of correction will be prolonged, if correction is achievable.
Touch-up implantations may be required in areas with greater motion or mechanical stress (e.g., nasolabial folds). All patients should be counseled to anticipate supplemental implantations to achieve and maintain optimal correction.
