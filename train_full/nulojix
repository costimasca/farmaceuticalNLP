NULOJIX should be administered in combination with basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and corticosteroids. In clinical trials the median (25th-75th percentile) corticosteroid doses were tapered to approximately 15 mg (10-20 mg) per day by the first 6 weeks and remained at approximately 10 mg (5-10 mg) per day for the first 6 months post-transplant. Corticosteroid utilization should be consistent with the NULOJIX clinical trial experience [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Clinical Studies].
Due to an increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) predominantly involving the central nervous system (CNS), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and serious CNS infections, administration of higher than the recommended doses or more frequent dosing of NULOJIX is not recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS].
NULOJIX is for intravenous infusion only. Patients do not require premedication prior to administration of NULOJIX.
Dosing instructions are provided in Table 1.
