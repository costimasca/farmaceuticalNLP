Sodium Lactate (sodium lactate injection in aviva)  Injection, 50 mEq (5 mEq/ mL), is administered intravenously    only after addition to a larger volume of fluid.The amount of sodium ion and    lactate ion to be added to larger volume intravenous fluids should be determined    in accordance with the electrolyte requirements of each individual patient.
All or part of the contents of one (50 mEq in 10 mL) or more vial containers may be added to other intravenous solutions to provide any desired number of milliequivalents of lactate anion (with the same number of milliequiva-lents of Na+). The contents of one container (50 mEq in 10 mL) added to 290 mL of a nonelectrolyte solution or of Sterile Water for Injection will provide 300 mL of an approximately isotonic (1/6 molar) concentration of sodium lactate (sodium lactate injection in aviva)  (1.9%), containing 167 mEq/L each of Na+ and lactate anion.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
