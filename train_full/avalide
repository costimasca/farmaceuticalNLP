The side effects of irbesartan are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. [See ADVERSE REACTIONS.]
Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 to 4 weeks after a change in dose.
AVALIDE may be administered with or without food.
AVALIDE may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.
The usual regimens of therapy with AVALIDE may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is >30 mL/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so AVALIDE is not recommended.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.
In patients not controlled on monotherapy with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide, the recommended doses of AVALIDE, in order of increasing mean effect, are (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) 150/12.5 mg, 300/12.5 mg, and 300/25 mg. The largest incremental effect will likely be in the transition from monotherapy to 150/12.5 mg. [See Clinical Studies.]
AVALIDE may be substituted for the titrated components.
The usual starting dose is AVALIDE 150/12.5 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 300/25 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies]. AVALIDE is not recommended as initial therapy in patients with intravascular volume depletion [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
