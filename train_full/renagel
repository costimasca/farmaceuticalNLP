The recommended starting dose of Renagel is 800 to 1600 mg, which can be administered as one or two 800 mg Renagel ®Tablets or two to four 400 mg Renagel® Tablets, with meals based on serum phosphorus level. Table 1 provides recommended starting doses of Renagel for patients not taking a phosphate binder.

In a study in 84 CKD patients on hemodialysis, a similar reduction in serum phosphorus was seen with equivalent doses (approximately mg for mg) of Renagel and calcium acetate. Table 2 gives recommended starting doses of Renagel based on a patient's current calcium acetate dose.
Table 2: Starting Dose for Dialysis Patients Switching From Calcium Acetate to Renagel 
Dosage should be adjusted based on the serum phosphorus concentration with a goal of lowering serum phosphorus to 5.5 mg/dL or less. The dose may be increased or decreased by one tablet per meal at two week intervals as necessary. Table 3 gives a dose titration guideline. The average dose in a Phase 3 trial designed to lower  serum phosphorus to 5.0 mg/dL or less was approximately three Renagel 800 mg tablets per meal. The maximum average daily Renagel dose studied was 13 grams.
