Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with COTELLIC with vemurafenib. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.
The recommended dosage regimen of COTELLIC is 60 mg (three 20 mg tablets) orally taken once daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Studies].
Take COTELLIC with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If a dose of COTELLIC is missed or if vomiting occurs when the dose is taken, resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.
Do not take strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors while taking COTELLIC.
If concurrent short term (14 days or less) use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable for patients who are taking COTELLIC 60 mg, reduce COTELLIC dose to 20 mg. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume previous dose of COTELLIC 60 mg [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Use an alternative to a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor in patients who are taking a reduced dose of COTELLIC (40 or 20 mg daily) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
