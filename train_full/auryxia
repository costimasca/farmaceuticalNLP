The recommended starting dose is 2 tablets orally 3 times per day with meals. Serum phosphorus levels should be monitored and the dose of Auryxia titrated in decrements or increments of 1 to 2 tablets per day as needed to maintain serum phosphorus at target levels, up to a maximum dose of 12 tablets daily. Dose can be titrated at 1-week or longer intervals.
In a clinical trial conducted in the United States, patients required an average of 8 to 9 tablets a day to control serum phosphorus levels.
