The recommended initial dose of CaloMist Nasal Spray is one spray in   each nostril once daily (25 mcg per nostril, total daily dose 50 mcg). The dose   should be increased to one spray in each nostril twice daily (total daily dose   100 mcg) for patients with an inadequate response to once daily dosing.
The dosing of CaloMist Nasal Spray and other intranasal medications   should be separated by several hours, and these patients should have more frequent   monitoring of vitamin B12 concentrations because of the potential   for erratic absorption.
The pump must be primed before the bottle is used for the first time. To prime   the pump, place the nozzle between the first and second finger with the thumb   on the bottom of the bottle. Pump the unit firmly and quickly then repeat this   priming an additional 6 times for a total of 7 priming sprays. Now the nasal   spray is ready for first-time use. If 5 or more days elapse since last use,   the pump must be re-primed with two re-priming sprays.
Additional instructions are provided in the patient instruction sheet [see   Patient Counseling Information].
