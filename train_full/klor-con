Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient but is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day for the prevention of hypokalemia to 40-100 mEq per day or more for the treatment of potassium depletion.
The usual adult dose is 20-100 mEq of potassium per day (one KLOR-CON速 20 mEq packet 1 to 5 times daily after meals or one KLOR-CON速 /25 25 mEq packet 1 to 4 times daily after meals).
The contents of each KLOR-CON速 packet should be dissolved in at least 4 ounces of cold water or other beverage. The contents of each KLOR-CON速 /25 packet should be dissolved in at least 5 ounces of cold water or other beverage. These preparations, like other potassium supplements, must be properly diluted to avoid the possibility of gastrointestinal irritation.
