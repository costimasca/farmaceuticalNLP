One syringe of HyperRHO S/D Mini-Dose provides sufficient antibody to prevent Rh sensitization to 2.5 mL Rho(D) positive packed red cells or the equivalent (5 mL) of whole blood. This dose is sufficient to provide protection against maternal Rh sensitization for women undergoing spontaneous or induced abortion of up to 12 weeks' gestation.
Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human) — HyperRHO® S/D Mini-Dose should be administered within 3 hours or as soon as possible following spontaneous or induced abortion. If prompt administration is not possible, HyperRHO S/D Mini-Dose should be given within 72 hours following termination of the pregnancy. HyperRHO S/D Mini-Dose is administered intramuscularly, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal  region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.10
