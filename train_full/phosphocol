The suggested dose range employed in the average patient (70 kg) is:
Intraperitoneal instillation: 370 to 740 megabecquerels (10 to 20 millicuries)
Intrapleural instillation: 222 to 444 megabecquerels (6 to 12 millicuries)
Doses for interstitial use should be based on estimated gram weight of tumor, about 3.7 to 18.5 MBq/gm (0.1 to 0.5 mCi/gm).
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.
Phosphorus P 32 decays by beta emission with a physical half-life of 14.3 days.1    The mean energy of the beta particle is 695 keV.
Table 1. Principal Radiation Emission Data 
The range of the phosphorus P 32 beta particle, which has a maximum energy of 1.71 MeV, is 2.9 mm of aluminum.
To correct for physical decay of this radionuclide, the percentages that remain at selected time intervals before and after the day of calibration are shown in Table 2.
Table 2. Physical Decay Chart; Phosphorus P 32, Half-life    14.3 days 
The effective half-life of phosphorus P 32 is considered to be equal to its physical half-life, with a residence time of 495 hours.
The radiation dose from a uniformly distributed concentration of 37 kilobecquerels    (1 microcurie) per gram within a 16-gram prostate is estimated to be equivalent    to about 7.3 grays (730 rads)2. Table 3 shows the estimated radiation    doses to the prostate and the pleural or peritoneal surfaces3 of    an average patient (70 kg) from a dose of 740 megabecquerels (20 millicuries)    of phosphorus P 32.
In comparison to the distribution in the prostate, the distribution of phosphorus    P 32 on the pleural and peritoneal surfaces is non-uniform, with great extremes    in local doses. To obtain an estimate of the average dose, the surface area    of the pleural and peritoneal cavities can be assumed to amount to 4,000 and    5,000 cm2, respectively. The estimated radiation doses to an average    patient (70 kg) with 90% retention of a dose of 740 megabecquerels (20 millicuries)    of phosphorus P 32 distributed uniformly over these areas are shown in Table    3. The decreases of the averaged radiation doses at various tissue depths away    from the surfaces of the pleural and peritoneal cavities are also tabulated.
