The recommended once-daily dose of Valturna is 150/160 mg or 300/320 mg. The recommended initial once-daily dose of Valturna is 150/160 mg. Titrate as needed to a maximum of 300/320 mg.
Patients switched from monotherapy to Valturna on average experience greater blood pressure reductions with use of the combination product.
The antihypertensive effect of Valturna is largely attained within 2 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 300/320 mg.
A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with aliskiren alone or valsartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone may be switched to combination therapy with Valturna. The usual recommended starting dose is 150/160 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure.
For convenience, patients receiving aliskiren and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive a single tablet of Valturna containing the same component doses.
The usual recommended starting dose of Valturna is 150/160 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 300/320 mg once daily.
Valturna is not recommended for use as initial therapy in patients with intravascular   volume depletion [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking Valturna with regard   to meals. High-fat meals decrease absorption substantially [see CLINICAL   PHARMACOLOGY].
