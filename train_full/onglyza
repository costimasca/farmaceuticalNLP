The recommended dosage of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg or 5 mg once daily taken regardless of meals. ONGLYZA tablets must not be split or cut.
No dosage adjustment for ONGLYZA is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl]  > 50 mL/min).
The dosage of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg once daily (regardless of meals) for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (creatinine clearance [CrCl]  â‰¤ 50 mL/min) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and Clinical Studies]. ONGLYZA should be administered following hemodialysis. ONGLYZA has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
Because the dosage of ONGLYZA should be limited to 2.5 mg based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of ONGLYZA and periodically thereafter. Renal function can be estimated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The dosage of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
When ONGLYZA is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or with insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
