Select patients for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC with IRESSA based on the presence of EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in their tumor [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Clinical Studies]. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of EGFR mutations in NSCLC is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.
The recommended dose of IRESSA is 250 mg orally once daily with or without food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Do not take a missed dose within 12 hours of the next dose.
Immerse IRESSA tablets in 4 to 8 ounces of water by dropping the tablet in water, and stir for approximately 15 minutes. Immediately drink the liquid or administer through a naso-gastric tube. Rinse the container with 4 to 8 ounces of water and immediately drink or administer through the naso-gastric tube.
