OSPHENA is an estrogen  agonist/antagonist which has agonistic effects on the endometrium. Generally, when a product with estrogen agonistic effects on the endometrium is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of OSPHENA should be for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
Take one 60 mg tablet with food once daily.
