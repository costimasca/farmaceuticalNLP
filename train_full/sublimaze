50 mcg = 0.05 mg = 1 mL
Dosage should be individualized. Some of the factors to be considered in determining   the dose are age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition,   use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used and the surgical procedure   involved. Dosage should be reduced in elderly or debilitated patients (see PRECAUTIONS).
Vital signs should be monitored routinely.
Usage in Children: For induction and maintenance in children 2 to 12 years   of age, a reduced dose as low as 2 to 3 mcg/kg is recommended.

DOSAGE RANGE CHART 
When attenuation of the responses to surgical stress is especially important,   doses of 50 to 100 mcg/kg (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) (1 to 2 mL/kg) may be administered   with oxygen and a muscle relaxant. This technique has been reported to provide   anesthesia without the use of additional anesthetic agents. In certain cases,   doses up to 150 mcg/kg (0.15 mg/kg) (3 mL/kg) may be necessary to produce this   anesthetic effect. It has been used for open heart surgery and certain other   major surgical procedures in patients for whom protection of the myocardium   from excess oxygen demand is particularly indicated, and for certain complicated   neurological and orthopedic procedures.
As noted above, it is essential that qualified personnel and adequate facilities   be available for the management of respiratory depression.
See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for use of SUBLIMAZE (fentanyl citrate)   with other CNS depressants, and in patients with altered response.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter   and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
