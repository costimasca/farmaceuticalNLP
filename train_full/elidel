Apply a thin layer of ELIDEL (pimecrolimus) Cream, 1% to the affected skin twice daily. The patient should stop using ELIDEL Cream, 1% when signs and symptoms (e.g., itch, rash and redness) resolve and should be instructed on what actions to take if symptoms recur.
If signs and symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks, patients should be re-examined by their health care provider to confirm the diagnosis of  atopic dermatitis.
Continuous long-term use of ELIDEL Cream, 1% should be avoided, and application should be limited to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The safety of ELIDEL Cream, 1% under occlusion, which may promote systemic exposure, has not been evaluated. Avoid use of ELIDEL Cream, 1% with occlusive dressings.
