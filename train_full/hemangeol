Initiate treatment at age 5 weeks to 5 months.
The recommended starting dose of HEMANGEOL is 0.15 mL/kg (0.6 mg/kg) (see Table 1) twice daily, taken at least 9 hours apart. After 1 week, increase the daily dose to 0.3 mL/kg (1.1 mg/kg) twice daily. After 2 weeks of treatment, increase the dose to 0.4 mL/kg (1.7 mg/kg) twice daily and maintain this for 6 months. Readjust the dose periodically as the child's weight increases.
To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, administer HEMANGEOL orally during or right after a feeding. Skip the dose if the child is not eating or is vomiting [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Monitor heart rate and blood pressure for 2 hours after HEMANGEOL initiation or dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
If hemangiomas recur, treatment may be re-initiated [see Clinical Studies].
HEMANGEOL is supplied with an oral dosing syringe for administration. Administration directly into the child's mouth is recommended. Nevertheless, if necessary, the product may be diluted in a small quantity of milk or fruit juice, given in a baby's bottle.
