The recommended dose of OraVerse is based on the number of cartridges of local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor administered:
 
OraVerse should be administered following the dental procedure using the same location(s) and technique(s) (infiltration or block injection) employed for the administration of the local anesthetic.
Chemically disinfect the carpule cap by wiping with either isopropyl alcohol (91%) or ethyl alcohol (70%). Many commercially available brands of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, as well as solutions of ethyl alcohol not of U.S.P. grade, contain denaturants that are injurious to rubber and therefore are not to be used.
Inspect carpules visually prior to administration and do not use if particulate matter, discoloration, cracks in the glass, protruding plungers or other defects are observed.
Note: Do not administer OraVerse if particulate matter, discoloration, cracks in the glass, protruding plungers or other defects are observed.
In pediatric patients weighing between  ≥ 15 kg and  < 30 kg, the maximum dose of OraVerse recommend is ½ cartridge (0.2 mg). (Note: Use in pediatric patients under 3 years of age or weighing less than15 kg (33 lbs) is not recommended. A dose of more than 1 cartridge [0.4 mg] of OraVerse has not been studied in children less than 4 years of age.)
