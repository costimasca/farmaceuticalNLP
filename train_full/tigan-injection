Dosage should be adjusted according to the indication for therapy, severity of symptoms and the response of the patient.
Dose adjustment such as reducing the total dose administered at each dosing or increasing the dosing interval should be considered in elderly patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance  ≤  70 mL/min/1.73m²). Final dose adjustment should be based upon integration of clinical efficacy and safety considerations. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS).
In subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance  ≤  70 mL/min/1.73m²), dose adjustment such as reducing the total dose administered at each dosing or increasing the dosing interval should be considered. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
INJECTABLE, 100 mg/mL (Not for use in pediatric patients)
