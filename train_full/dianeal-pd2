DIANEAL peritoneal dialysis solutions are intended for intraperitoneal administration only. Not for intravenous administration.
Select mode of therapy, frequency of treatment, formulation, fill volume, duration of dwell, and length of dialysis based on the patient's clinical condition, fluid, electrolyte and specific needs.The fill volume depends on body size, usually from 2.0 to 2.5 liters per 1.73m² for adults.
DIANEAL is intended for use in Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) or Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD). Refer to directions accompanying ancillary equipment for CAPD and APD system preparation.
To avoid the risk of severe dehydration and hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein, it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with the lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange. As the patientâ€™s body weight becomes closer to the ideal dry weight, lowering the dextrose concentration of DIANEAL is recommended. DIANEAL 4.25% dextrose-containing solution has the highest osmolarity of the DIANEAL solutions and using it for all exchanges may cause dehydration [see Dosage Forms and Strengths].
If the resealable rubber plug on the medication port is missing or partly removed, do not use the product if medication is to be added.
To add a medication:
DIANEAL can be warmed to 37°C (98.6°F). Only dry heat should be used. For CAPD, it is best to warm solutions within the overwrap using a heating pad. Do not immerse DIANEAL in water for warming. Do not use a microwave oven to warm DIANEAL.
To open, tear the overwrap down at the slit and remove the solution container. Do not use sharp objects to remove the overwrap.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use solutions that are cloudy, discolored, contain visible particulate matter, or show evidence of leakage.
Some opacity of the plastic, due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process, may be observed. This does not affect the solution quality or safety and may often leave a slight amount of moisture within the overwrap. The opacity should diminish gradually.
Inspect the bag connector to ensure the tip protector (pull ring, blue pull tip, or blue twist-off tip) is attached. Do not use if the tip protector is not attached to the connector. Inspect the DIANEAL container for signs of leakage and check for minute leaks by squeezing the container firmly. If the container has frangible(s), inspect that they are positioned correctly and are not broken. Do not use DIANEAL if the frangible(s) are broken or leaks are suspected as sterility may be impaired.
For DIANEAL in ULTRABAG, inspect the tubing and drain container for presence of solution. Small droplets are acceptable, but if solution flows past the frangible prior to use, do not use and discard the units.
