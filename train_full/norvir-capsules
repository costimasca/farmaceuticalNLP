NORVIR is administered orally in combination with other antiretroviral agents. It is recommended that NORVIR be taken with meals if possible.
Patients should be aware that frequently observed adverse events, such as mild to moderate gastrointestinal disturbances and paraesthesias, may diminish as therapy is continued.
Dose reduction of NORVIR is necessary when used with other protease inhibitors: atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir.
Prescribers should consult the full prescribing information and clinical study information of these protease inhibitors if they are co-administered with a reduced dose of ritonavir [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS].
The recommended dosage of ritonavir is 600 mg twice daily by mouth. Use of a dose titration schedule may help to reduce treatment-emergent adverse events while maintaining appropriate ritonavir plasma levels. Ritonavir should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily. The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration.
The recommended dosage of ritonavir in children greater than 1 month is 350 to 400 mg per m² twice daily by mouth and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily. Ritonavir should be started at 250 mg per m² twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m² twice daily. If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m² twice daily due to adverse events, the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents, however, alternative therapy should be considered. The use of NORVIR oral solution is recommended for children greater than 1 month who cannot swallow capsules. Please refer to the NORVIR oral solution full prescribing information for pediatric dosage and administration.
