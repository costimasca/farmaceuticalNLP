The recommended dose of Femara is one 2.5 mg tablet administered once a day, without regard to meals.
In the adjuvant setting, the optimal duration of treatment with letrozole is unknown. The planned duration of treatment in the study was 5 years with 73% of the patients having completed  adjuvant therapy. Treatment should be discontinued at relapse [see Clinical Studies].
In the extended adjuvant setting, the optimal treatment duration with Femara is not known. The planned duration of treatment in the study was 5 years. In the final updated analysis, conducted at a median follow-up of 62 months, the median treatment duration was 60 months. Seventy-one percent of patients were treated for at least 3 years and 58% of patients completed least 4.5 years of extended adjuvant treatment. The treatment should be discontinued at tumor relapse [see Clinical Studies].
In patients with advanced disease, treatment with Femara should continue until tumor progression is evident. [see Clinical Studies]
No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, although Femara blood concentrations were modestly increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis. The dose of Femara in patients with cirrhosis and severe hepatic dysfunction should be reduced by 50% [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. The recommended dose of Femara for such patients is 2.5 mg administered every other day. The effect of hepatic impairment on Femara exposure in noncirrhotic cancer patients with elevated bilirubin levels has not been determined.
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment if creatinine clearance is  â‰¥ 10 mL/min. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
