The maximum recommended single dose is 40 mg.
In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 20 mg and 40 mg were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. A greater proportion of patients had a response following a 40 mg dose than following a 20 mg dose [see Clinical Studies].
If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking RELPAX, or returns after transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.
The safety of treating an average of more than 3 migraine attacks in a 30-day period has not been established.
