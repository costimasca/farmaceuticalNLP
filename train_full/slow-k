The usual dietary intake of potassium by the average adult is 50-100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses of 40-l00 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given, such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.
One Slow-K tablet provides 8 mEq of potassium chloride.
Slow-K (potassium chloride)  should be taken with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid.    This product should not be taken on an empty stomach because of its potential    for gastric irritation (see WARNINGS).
Note: Slow-K (potassium chloride)  extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never    crushed, chewed, or sucked.
