The recommended dosage for adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and    older is two inhalations four times a day at regular intervals, which provides    a dose of 14 mg per day. In patients whose asthma is well controlled on this    dosage (e.g., patients who only need occasional inhaled or oral beta2-agonists    and who are not experiencing serious exacerbations), less frequent administration    may be effective.
Each Tilade (nedocromil inhalation aerosol)  Inhaler canister must be primed with 3 actuations prior    to the first use. If a canister remains unused for more than 7 days, then it    should be reprimed with 3 actuations. Tilade (nedocromil inhalation aerosol)  Inhaler may be added to    the patient's existing treatment regimen (e.g., bronchodilators). When a clinical    response to Tilade (nedocromil inhalation aerosol)  Inhaler is evident and if the patient's asthma is    under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication    usage gradually. Proper inhalational technique is essential (see Patient    Instructions for Use). Patients should be advised that the optimal effect    of Tilade (nedocromil inhalation aerosol)  therapy depends upon its administration at regular intervals,    even during symptom-free periods.
