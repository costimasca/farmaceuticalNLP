The dose of amobarbital sodium must be individualized with full knowledge of its particular characteristics and recommended rate of administration. Factors of consideration are the patient's age, weight, and condition. The maximum single dose for an adult is 1 g.
Intramuscular injection of the sodium salts of barbiturates should be made   deeply into a large muscle. The average intramuscular dose ranges from 65 mg   to 0.5 g. A volume of 5 mL (irrespective of concentration) should not be exceeded   at any one site because of possible tissue irritation. Twenty percent solutions   may be used so that a small volume can contain a large dose. After IM injection   of a hypnotic dose, the patient's vital signs should be monitored. Superficial    intramuscular or subcutaneous injections may be painful and may produce sterile   abscesses or sloughs.
Intravenous injection is restricted to conditions in which other routes are   not feasible, either because the patient is unconscious (as in cerebral hemorrhage,   eclampsia, or status epilepticus), because the patient resists (as in delirium),   or because prompt action is imperative. Slow IV injection is essential, and   patients should be carefully observed during administration. This requires that   blood pressure, respiration, and cardiac function be maintained, vital signs   be recorded and equipment for resuscitation and artificial ventilation be available.   The rate of IV injection for adults should not exceed 50 mg/min to prevent sleep   or sudden respiratory depression. The final dosage is determined to a great   extent by the patient's reaction to the slow administration of the drug.
Adults:
Dosage should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated because these patients   may be more sensitive to barbiturates. Dosage should be reduced for patients   with impaired renal function or hepatic disease. Ordinarily, an intravenous   dose of 65 mg to 0.5 g may be given to a child 6 to 12 years of age.
