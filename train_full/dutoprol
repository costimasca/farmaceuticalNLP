The recommended starting dose of DUTOPROL (metoprolol succinate extended release and hydrochlorothiazide) is 25 mg/12.5 mg taken orally once daily with or without food. Depending on the blood pressure response, the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2 weeks to a maximum recommended dose of 200 mg/25 mg (two DUTOPROL 100 mg/12.5 mg tablets) once daily [see Clinical Studies].
For specific advice on blood pressure goals, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).
DUTOPROL may be administered with other antihypertensive drugs. Patients titrated to the individual components (metoprolol succinate and hydrochlorothiazide) may instead receive the corresponding dose of DUTOPROL.
A patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled by metoprolol succinate alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to DUTOPROL.
