The recommended starting dosage is 1 mg taken 3 times a day. For patients who may not tolerate the hypotensive effect of Adempas, consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg taken three times a day. If systolic blood pressure remains greater than 95 mmHg and the patient has no signs or symptoms of hypotension, up-titrate the dose by 0.5 mg taken three times a day. Dose increases should be no sooner than 2 weeks apart. The dose can be increased to the highest tolerated dosage, up to a maximum of 2.5 mg taken three times a day. If at any time, the patient has symptoms of hypotension, decrease the dosage by 0.5 mg taken three times a day.
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Adempas may be crushed and mixed with water or soft foods (such as applesauce) immediately before administration [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If a dose is missed, advise patients to continue with the next regularly scheduled dose.
In case Adempas is interrupted for 3 days or more, re-titrate Adempas.
Obtain pregnancy tests prior to initiation and monthly during treatment [see Use In Specific Populations].
Consider titrating to dosages higher than 2.5 mg three times a day, if tolerated, in patients who smoke. A dose decrease may be required in patients who stop smoking [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg, three times a day when initiating Adempas in patients receiving strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein/breast cancer resistance protein (P-gp/BCRP) inhibitors such as azole antimycotics (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (for example, ritonavir). Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on treatment with strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
