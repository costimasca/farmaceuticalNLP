To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, oral contraceptives must be   taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.
28-Day Schedule: For a DAY 1 START, count the first day of menstrual   flow as Day 1 and the first tablet (white or yellow-green or blue) is then taken   on Day 1. For a SUNDAY START when menstrual flow begins on or before Sunday,   the first tablet (white or yellow-green or blue) is taken on that day. With   either a Day 1 START or SUNDAY START, 1 tablet (white or yellow-green or blue)   is taken each day at the same time for 21 days. Then the orange tablets are   taken for 7 days, whether bleeding has stopped or not. After all 28 tablets   have been taken, whether bleeding has stopped or not, the same dosage schedule   is repeated beginning on the following day.
