The recommended dose of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT is one inhalation four times a day. Patients may take additional inhalations as required; however, the total number of inhalations should not exceed six in 24 hours.
Prior to first use, the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT cartridge is inserted into the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT inhaler and the unit is primed. When using the unit for the first time, patients are to actuate the inhaler toward the ground until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times. The unit is then considered primed and ready for use. If not used for more than 3 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler once to prepare the inhaler for use. If not used for more than 21 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times to prepare the inhaler for use [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
Safety and efficacy of additional doses of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT beyond six inhalations/24 hours have not been studied. Also, safety and efficacy of extra doses of ipratropium or albuterol in addition to the recommended doses of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT have not been studied.
