The recommended dose of BELVIQ XR is 20 mg administered orally once daily. BELVIQ XR tablet must be swallowed whole and must not be chewed, crushed, or divided. Do not exceed recommended dose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and PATIENT INFORMATION].
BELVIQ XR can be taken with or without food.
Response to therapy should be evaluated by week 12. If a patient has not lost at least 5% of baseline body weight, discontinue BELVIQ XR, as it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment [see Clinical Studies].
