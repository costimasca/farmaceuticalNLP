The suspension is intended for intramuscular administration only.
When multi-dose vials are used, special care to prevent contamination of the contents is essential [see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS].
Doses of 400 mg to 1000 mg of DEPO-PROVERA Sterile Aqueous Suspension per week are recommended initially. If improvement is noted within a few weeks or months and the disease appears stabilized, it may be possible to maintain improvement with as little as 400 mg per month. Medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended as primary therapy, but as adjunctive and palliative treatment in advanced inoperable cases including those with recurrent or metastatic disease.
Of the 349 subjects in a clinical study of Depo Provera in renal carcinoma, 30 percent were 65 and over, while 5 percent were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.
This product has been used primarily in post-menopausal  women for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma. Clinical experience has not identified differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger patients.
DEPO-PROVERA Sterile Aqueous Suspension should not be used by women with significant liver disease and should be discontinued if  jaundice or disturbances of liver function occur [see PRECAUTIONS].
The effect of renal impairment on DEPO-PROVERA pharmacokinetics has not been studied.
