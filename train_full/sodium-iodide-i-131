The suggested oral dosage ranges employed in the average patient (70 kg) for diagnostic procedures for thyroid function are as follows:
Thyroid Uptake: 0.185 to 0.555 megabecquerels (5 to 15 microcuries)
Scintiscanning:1.85 to 3.7 megabecquerels (50 to 100 microcuries)
Localization of extra-thyroidal metastases: 37 megabecquerels (1000 microcuries).
Waterproof gloves should be used during the entire handling and administration procedure.
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.
The estimated absorbed radiation doses2 to an average (70 kg) euthyroid (normal functioning thyroid) patient from an oral dose of 3.7 megabecquerels (100 microcuries) of iodine I-131 are shown in Table 4.
