For intravenous use only. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually   for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution   and container permit. Do not use if particulate matter is seen or if the contents   of the vial are discolored or if the vial is damaged in any way.
For spider veins (varicose veins  â‰¤ 1 mm in diameter), use Asclera (polidocanol injection)  0.5%. For   reticular veins (varicose veins 1 to 3 mm in diameter), use Asclera (polidocanol injection)  1%. Use   0.1 to 0.3 mL per injection and no more than 10 mL per session.
Use a syringe (glass or plastic) with a fine needle (typically, 26- or 30-gauge).    Insert the needle tangentially into the vein and inject the solution slowly    while the needle is still in the vein. Apply only gentle pressure during injection    to prevent vein rupture. After the needle has been removed and the injection    site has been covered, apply compression in the form of a stocking or bandage.    After the treatment session, encourage the patient to walk for 15 to 20 minutes.    Keep the patient under observation to detect any anaphylactic or allergic reaction    (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS).
Maintain compression for 2 to 3 days after treatment of spider veins and for   5 to 7 days for reticular veins. For extensive varicosities, longer compression   treatment with compression bandages or a gradient compression stocking of a   higher compression class is recommended. Post-treatment compression is necessary   to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
Repeat treatments may be necessary if the extent of the varicose veins requires   more than 10 ml. These treatments should be separated by 1 to 2 weeks.
Small intravaricose blood clots (thrombi) that develop may be removed by stab   incision and thrombus expression (microthrombectomy).
