Plavix can be administered with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The recommended daily dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Although a higher dose regimen in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY], an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established.
Avoid using omeprazole or esomeprazole with Plavix. Omeprazole and esomeprazole significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix. When concomitant administration of a PPI is required, consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
