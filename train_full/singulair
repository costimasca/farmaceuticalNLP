SINGULAIR should be taken once daily in the evening. The following doses are recommended:
For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.
For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5-mg chewable tablet.
For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4-mg chewable tablet or one packet of 4-mg oral granules.

There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion.
For prevention of EIB, a single dose of SINGULAIR should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. The following doses are recommended:
For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.
For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5-mg chewable tablet.
An additional dose of SINGULAIR should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking SINGULAIR daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting Î²-agonist. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 6 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of SINGULAIR for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB.
For allergic rhinitis, SINGULAIR should be taken once daily. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs.
The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended:
For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.
For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5-mg chewable tablet.
For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4-mg chewable tablet or one packet of 4-mg oral granules.
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established.
The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended:
For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.
For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5-mg chewable tablet.
For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4-mg chewable tablet or one packet of 4-mg oral granules.
For pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age: one packet of 4-mg oral granules.
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established.
Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one SINGULAIR dose daily in the evening.
SINGULAIR 4-mg oral granules can be administered either directly in the mouth, dissolved in 1 teaspoonful (5 mL) of cold or room temperature baby formula or breast milk, or mixed with a spoonful of cold or room temperature soft foods; based on stability studies, only applesauce, carrots, rice, or ice cream should be used. The packet should not be opened until ready to use. After opening the packet, the full dose (with or without mixing with baby formula, breast milk, or food) must be administered within 15 minutes. If mixed with baby formula, breast milk, or food, SINGULAIR oral granules must not be stored for future use. Discard any unused portion. SINGULAIR oral granules are not intended to be dissolved in any liquid other than baby formula or breast milk for administration. However, liquids may be taken subsequent to administration. SINGULAIR oral granules can be administered without regard to the time of meals.
