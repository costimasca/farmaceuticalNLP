Preprandial glucose monitoring is recommended at treatment initiation and until a well-tolerated dose is established. If frequent symptoms of hypoglycemia or severe hypoglycemia occur, preprandial glucose monitoring should continue. The dosage of INCRELEX® should be individualized for each patient. The recommended starting dose of INCRELEX® is 0.04 to 0.08 mg/kg (40 to 80 micrograms/kg) twice daily by subcutaneous injection. If well-tolerated for at least one week, the dose may be increased by 0.04 mg/kg per dose, to the maximum dose of 0.12 mg/kg given twice daily. Doses greater than 0.12 mg/kg given twice daily have not been evaluated in children with Primary IGFD and, due to potential hypoglycemic  effects, should not be used. If hypoglycemia occurs with recommended doses despite adequate food intake, the dose should be reduced. INCRELEX® should be administered shortly before or after (± 20 minutes) a meal or snack. If the patient is unable to eat shortly before or after a dose for any reason, that dose of INCRELEX® should be withheld. Subsequent doses of INCRELEX® should never be increased to make up for one or more omitted dose.
INCRELEX® is administered by subcutaneous injection.
INCRELEX® injection sites should be rotated to a different site (upper arm, thigh, buttock or abdomen) with each injection to help prevent lipohypertrophy.
INCRELEX® should be administered using sterile disposable syringes and needles. The syringes should be of small enough volume so that the prescribed dose can be withdrawn from the vial with accuracy.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
If using syringes that measure dose in units, doses in mg/kg must be converted to units using the following formula: Weight (kg) x Dose (mg/kg) x 1 mL/10 mg x 100 units/1 mL = units/injection.
