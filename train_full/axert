The recommended dose of AXERT® (almotriptan malate) in adults and adolescents age 12 to 17 years is 6.25 mg to 12.5 mg, with the 12.5 mg dose tending to be a more effective dose in adults. As individuals may vary in their response to different doses of AXERT®, the choice of dose should be made on an individual basis.
If the headache is relieved after the initial AXERT® dose but returns, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours. The effectiveness of a second dose has not been established in placebo-controlled trials. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 25 mg. The safety of treating an average of more than four migraines in a 30-day period has not been established.
The recommended starting dose of AXERT® in patients with hepatic impairment is 6.25 mg. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 12.5 mg over a 24-hour period [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The recommended starting dose of AXERT® in patients with severe renal impairment is 6.25 mg. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 12.5 mg over a 24-hour period [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
