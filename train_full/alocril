The recommended dosage is one or two drops in each eye twice a day. ALOCRILÂ® (nedocromil)     ophthalmic solution should be used at regular intervals.
Treatment should be continued throughout the period of exposure (i.e., until the pollen season is over  or until exposure to the offending allergen is terminated), even when symptoms are absent.
