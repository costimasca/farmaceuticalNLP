Table 1: Recommended Infusion Rates for Flebogamma 10% DIF 
As there are significant differences in the half-life of  IgG among patients with PI, the frequency and amount of immunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient. Adjust the dose according to clinical response.
Adjust the dosage over time to achieve the desired serum trough IgG levels and clinical responses. No randomized controlled trial data are available to determine an optimum target trough serum IgG level.
The recommended initial infusion rate of Flebogamma 10% DIF is 0.01 mL per kg body weight per minute (1 mg per kg per min) for the first thirty minutes. If tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to 0.04 mL per kg body weight per minute (4 mg per kg per min) and if tolerated, gradually increased to a maximum of 0.08 mL per kg body weight per min (8 mg per kg per min).
Monitor patient vital signs throughout the infusion. Slow or stop the infusion if adverse reactions occur. If symptoms subside promptly, the infusion may be resumed at a lower rate that is comfortable for the patient.
For the first 2-3 infusions, Flebogamma 10% DIF may be administered at infusion rates slower than recommended rates. If after administration of the first few infusions no adverse drug reactions are observed, the infusion rate for subsequent infusions may be slowly increased to the maximum rate. For patients experiencing adverse drug reactions, reduce the infusion rate in subsequent infusions or administer IGIV at 5% concentration.
