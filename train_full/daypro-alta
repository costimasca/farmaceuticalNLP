Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of DAYPRO ALTA and other treatment options before deciding to use DAYPRO ALTA. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.
After observing the response to initial therapy with DAYPRO ALTA, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patientâ€™s needs.
Divided doses may be tried in patients unable to tolerate single doses. For osteoarthritis patients of low body weight or with milder disease, an initial dose of one 600 mg tablet once a day may be appropriate. The maximum total daily dose is 1200 mg.
For OA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) given orally once a day.
For RA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) given orally once a day.
