For Intravenous or Intramuscular Use
DO NOT MIX OR CO-INFUSE INVANZ WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS. DO NOT USE DILUENTS CONTAINING DEXTROSE (α-D-GLUCOSE).
INVANZ may be administered by intravenous infusion for up to 14 days or intramuscular injection for up to 7 days. W hen administered intravenously, INVANZ should be infused over a period of 30 minutes. Intramuscular administration of INVANZ may be used as an alternative to intravenous administration in the treatment of those infections for which intramuscular therapy is appropriate.
The dose of INVANZ in patients 13 years of age and older is 1 gram (g) given once a day [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The dose of INVANZ in patients 3 months to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg twice daily (not to exceed 1 g/day).
Table 1 presents treatment guidelines for INVANZ.
Table 1 : Treatment Guidelines for Adults and Pediatric Patients With Normal Renal Function* and Body Weight 
Table 2 presents prophylaxis  guidelines for INVANZ.
Table 2 : Prophylaxis Guidelines for Adults 
INVANZ may be used for the treatment of infections in adult patients with renal impairment. In patients whose creatinine clearance is  > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is necessary. Adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance  ≤ 10 mL/min/1.73 m²) should receive 500 mg daily. A supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended if ertapenem is administered within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis. There are no data in pediatric patients with renal impairment.
W hen adult patients on hemodialysis are given the recommended daily dose of 500 mg of INVANZ within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, a supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended following the hemodialysis session. If INVANZ is given at least 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, no supplementary dose is needed. There are no data in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration. There are no data in pediatric patients on hemodialysis.
W hen only the serum creatinine is available, the following formula1 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

No dose adjustment recommendations can be made in patients with hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

Instructions For Use Of
INVANZ® (Ertapenem for Injection) IN ADD-Vantage VIALS
For I.V. Use Only.
Peel overwrap from the corner and remove container. Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually.
Remove the protective covers from the top of the vial and the vial port on the diluent container as follows:
To remove the breakaway vial cap, swing the pull ring over the top of the vial and pull down far enough to start the opening. (SEE FIGURE 1.) Pull the ring approximately half way around the cap and then pull straight up to remove the cap. (SEE FIGURE 2.) NOTE: DO NOT ACCESS VIAL W ITH SYRINGE.
Figure 1 
Figure 2 
To remove the vial port cover, grasp the tab on the pull ring, pull up to break the three tie strings, then pull back to remove the cover. (SEE FIGURE 3.)
Screw the vial into the vial port until it will go no further. THE VIAL MUST BE SCREWED IN TIGHTLY TO ASSURE A SEAL. This occurs approximately ½ turn (180°) after the first audible click. (SEE FIGURE 4.) The clicking sound does not assure a seal; the vial must be turned as far as it will go. NOTE: Once vial is seated, do not attempt to remove. (SEE FIGURE 4.)
Recheck the vial to assure that it is tight by trying to turn it further in the direction of assembly.
Label appropriately.

Squeeze the bottom of the diluent container gently to inflate the portion of the container surrounding the end of the drug vial.
With the other hand, push the drug vial down into the container telescoping the walls of the container. Grasp the inner cap of the vial through the walls of the container. (SEE FIGURE 5.)
Pull the inner cap from the drug vial. (SEE FIGURE 6.) Verify that the rubber stopper has been pulled out, allowing the drug and diluent to mix.
Mix container contents thoroughly and use within the specified time.

Figure 6 
Confirm the activation and admixture of vial contents.
Check for leaks by squeezing container firmly. If leaks are found, discard unit as sterility may be impaired. Close flow control clamp of administration set.
Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container.
Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the pin is firmly seated.
NOTE: See full directions on administration set carton.
Lift the free end of the hanger loop on the bottom of the vial, breaking the two tie strings. Bend the loop outward to lock it in the upright position, then suspend container from hanger.
Squeeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber.
Open flow control clamp and clear air from set. Close clamp.
Attach set to venipuncture device. If device is not indwelling, prime and make venipuncture.
Regulate rate of administration with flow control clamp.
WARNING: Do not use flexible container in series connections.
INVANZ (Ertapenem for Injection) 1 g single dose ADD-Vantage® vials should be prepared with ADD-Vantage® diluent containers containing 50 mL or 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. W hen prepared with this diluent, INVANZ (Ertapenem for Injection) maintains satisfactory potency for 6 hours at room temperature (25°C) or for 24 hours under refrigeration (5°C) and used within 4 hours after removal from refrigeration. Solutions of INVANZ should not be frozen.
Before administering, see accompanying package circular for INVANZ (Ertapenem for Injection). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use, whenever solution and container permit. Solutions of INVANZ range from colorless to pale yellow. Variations of color within this range do not affect the potency of the product.
