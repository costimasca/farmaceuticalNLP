The recommended starting dose and highest recommended dose of PULMICORT RESPULES (budesonide inhalation suspension) ,   based on prior asthma therapy, are listed in the following table.
 
Dosing recommendations based on previous therapy are as follows:
In symptomatic children not responding to non-steroidal therapy, a starting   dose of 0.25 mg once daily may be considered. If once-daily treatment does not   provide adequate control, the total daily dose should be increased and/or administered   as a divided dose. In all patients, it is desirable to downward-titrate to the   lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.
PULMICORT RESPULES (budesonide inhalation suspension)  should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an   air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable   face mask. Ultrasonic nebulizers are not suitable for the adequate administration   of PULMICORT RESPULES (budesonide inhalation suspension)  and, therefore, are NOT recommended.
The effects of mixing PULMICORT RESPULES (budesonide inhalation suspension)  with other nebulizable medications    have not been adequately assessed. PULMICORT RESPULES (budesonide inhalation suspension)  should be administered    separately in the nebulizer [see PATIENT INFORMATION,    Administration with a jet nebulizer].
A Pari-LC-Jet Plus Nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a   Pari Master compressor was used to deliver PULMICORT RESPULES (budesonide inhalation suspension)  to each patient   in 3 U.S. controlled clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT   RESPULES delivered by other nebulizers and compressors have not been established.
