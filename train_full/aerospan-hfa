AEROSPAN Inhalation Aerosol should be administered by the orally inhaled route in asthmatic patients aged 6 years and older. This product contains a built-in spacer. Do not use with any external spacer or holding chamber devices. Instruct patients to prepare the inhaler for use by pulling the built-in purple actuator out from the gray spacer and snapping into an “L” shape prior to use. Pediatric patients should administer this product under adult supervision.
The onset and degree of symptom relief with orally inhaled corticosteroids is usually apparent within 2-4 weeks after the start of treatment, and varies with individual patients. The time to improvement in asthma control was not evaluated in clinical studies with AEROSPAN Inhalation Aerosol. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 3-4 weeks of therapy, higher doses may provide additional asthma control. The safety and efficacy of AEROSPAN Inhalation Aerosol when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established.
The recommended starting dosage and the highest recommended dosage of AEROSPAN Inhalation Aerosol are listed in Table 1.
Table 1: Recommended Doses of AEROSPAN Inhalation Aerosol  Note: In all patients it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.
