After preparation with oxidant-free sodium pertechnetate Tc99m injection the suggested dose range of technetium Tc99m medronate injection in the average patient (70 kg) is 370-740 MBq (10-20 mCi) given intravenously. Imaging post injection is optimal at 1 to 4 hours.
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Shielding should be utilized when preparing the technetium Tc99m medronate injection.
Slow administration of the drug over a period of 30 seconds is recommended.
The effective half-life was assumed to be the physical half-life for all calculated values. The estimated radiation absorbed doses2 to an average patient (70 kg) for an intravenous injection of a maximum dose of 740 MBq (20 mCi) of technetium Tc99m medronate injection are shown in Table 4.
Table 4. Absorbed Radiation Dose2

The typical total body exposure to a person administering a maximum dose of    740 MBq (20 mCi) of technetium Tc99m to a patient is about 0.2 ÂµSv, 0.02 mR.3
