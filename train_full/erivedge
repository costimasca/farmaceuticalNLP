The recommended dose of ERIVEDGE is 150 mg taken orally once daily until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Studies].
ERIVEDGE may be taken with or without food. Swallow capsules whole. Do not open or crush capsules.
If a dose of ERIVEDGE is missed, do not make up that dose; resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.
