The recommended dose of ZETIA is 10 mg once daily.
ZETIA can be administered with or without food.
ZETIA may be administered with a statin (in patients with primary hyperlipidemia) or with fenofibrate (in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia) for incremental effect. For convenience, the daily dose of ZETIA may be taken at the same time as the statin or fenofibrate, according to the dosing recommendations for the respective medications.
Dosing of ZETIA should occur either ≥2 hours before or ≥4 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. When given with simvastatin in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate  < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), doses of simvastatin exceeding 20 mg should be used with caution and close monitoring [see Use in Specific Populations].
No dosage adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
