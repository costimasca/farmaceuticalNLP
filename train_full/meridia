The recommended starting dose of MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate)  is 10 mg administered once daily with   or without food. If there is inadequate weight loss, the dose may be titrated   after four weeks to a total of 15 mg once daily. The 5 mg dose should be reserved   for patients who do not tolerate the 10 mg dose. Blood pressure and heart rate    changes should be taken into account when making decisions regarding dose titration   (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
Doses above 15 mg daily are not recommended. In most of the clinical trials,   MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate)  was given in the morning.
Analysis of numerous variable s has indicated that approximately 60% of patients   who lose at least 4 pounds in the first 4 weeks of treatment with a given dose   of MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate)  in combination with a reduced-calorie diet lose at least 5% (placebo-subtracted)   of their initial body weight by the end of 6 months to 1 year of treatment on   that dose of MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate) . Conversely , approximately 80% of patients who do not   lose at least 4 pounds in the first 4 weeks of treatment with a given dose of   MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate)  do not lose at least 5% (placebo-subtracted) of their initial body weight   by the end of 6 months to 1 year of treatment on that dose. If a patient has   not lost at least 4 pounds in the first 4 weeks of treatment, the physician   should consider reevaluation of therapy which may include increasing the dose   or discontinuation of MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate) .
The safety and effectiveness of MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate) , as demonstrated in double-blind, placebo-controlled    trials, have not been determined beyond 2 years at this time.
