Apply a thin layer of Ultravate Cream to the affected skin once or twice daily, as directed by your physician, and rub in gently and completely.
Ultravate (halobetasol propionate) Cream is a super-high potency topical corticosteroid; therefore, treatment should be limited to two weeks, and amounts greater than 50 g/wk should not be used. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
Ultravate Cream should not be used with occlusive dressings.
