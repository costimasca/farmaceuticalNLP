Patients with tinea (pityriasis) versicolor should apply Mentax速 (butenafine)     once daily for two weeks. In the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis,    Mentax速 (butenafine)  should be applied twice daily for 7 days OR once daily for 4 weeks    (NOTE: in separate clinical trials, the 7-day dosing regimen was less efficacious    than the 4-week regimen (see Clinical Studies     Section). While the clinical significance of this difference is unknown,    these data should be carefully considered before selecting the dosage regiment    for patients at risk for the development of bacterial cellulitis of the lower    extremity associated with interdigital cracking/fissuring).
Patients with tinea corporis or tinea cruris should apply Mentax速 (butenafine)     once daily for two weeks.
Sufficient Mentax速 (butenafine)  Cream should be applied to cover affected areas and immediately surrounding skin of patients with tinea versicolor, interdigital tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis and therapy should be reviewed.
