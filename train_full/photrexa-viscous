Using topical anesthesia,  debride the epithelium to a diameter of approximately 9 mm using standard  aseptic technique. Post epithelial debridement, instill 1 drop of Photrexa Viscous topically on the eye every 2 minutes for 30 minutes.
At the end of the 30 minute soaking period, examine the eye under the slit lamp for the presence of a yellow flare in the anterior chamber. If the yellow flare is not detected, instill 1 drop of Photrexa Viscous every 2 minutes for an additional 2 to 3 drops and recheck for the presence of a yellow flare. This process can be repeated as necessary.
Once the yellow flare is observed, perform ultrasound pachymetry. If corneal thickness is less than 400 microns, instill 2 drops of PHOTREXA every 5 to 10 seconds until the corneal thickness increases to at least 400 microns. Irradiation should not be performed unless this 400 micron threshold is met and the yellow flare is seen.
Irradiate the eye for 30 continuous minutes at 3mW/cmÂ² at a wavelength of 365 nm, centered over the  cornea, using the KXL System as per the instructions in the KXL manual. During irradiation, continue topical instillation of PHOTREXA VISCOUS onto the eye every 2 minutes for the 30 minute irradiation period.
For topical ophthalmic use. Do not inject.
Single use PHOTREXA VISCOUS and PHOTREXA only. Discard syringe(s) after use.
PHOTREXA VISCOUS and PHOTREXA are for use with the KXL System only.
PLEASE REFER TO THE KXL OPERATOR'S MANUAL FOR SPECIFIC DEVICE INSTRUCTIONS.
