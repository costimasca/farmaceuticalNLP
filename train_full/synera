SYNERA should only be applied to intact skin. Use immediately after opening the pouch.
While efficacy has not been established for children less than 3 years of age, safe use of SYNERA in infants 4 to 6 months of age was documented in one study.
Simultaneous or sequential application of multiple SYNERA patches is not recommended. However, application of one additional patch at a new location to facilitate venous access is acceptable after a failed attempt. When SYNERA is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations should be considered, as local anesthetics are thought to have at least additive toxicities. If irritation or a burning sensation occurs during application, remove the patch.
