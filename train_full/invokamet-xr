If an inducer of UGTs (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) is co-administered with INVOKAMET XR, consider increasing the dose of canagliflozin to a total daily dose of 300 mg once daily in patients currently tolerating INVOKAMET XR with 100 mg canagliflozin once daily who have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater and require additional glycemic control [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
Consider another antihyperglycemic agent in patients with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT inducer.
Discontinue INVOKAMET XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intraarterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart INVOKAMET XR if renal function is stable [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
