For intravenous use only.
The recommended dose of PRAXBIND is 5 g, provided as two separate vials each containing 2.5 g/50 mL idarucizumab (see Figure 1). There is limited data to support administration of an additional 5 g of PRAXBIND [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].

Patients being treated with dabigatran therapy have underlying disease states that predispose them to thromboembolic events. Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. To reduce this risk, resumption of anticoagulant therapy should be considered as soon as medically appropriate.
Idarucizumab is a specific reversal agent for dabigatran, with no impact on the effect of other anticoagulant or antithrombotic therapies.
Pradaxa treatment can be initiated 24 hours after administration of PRAXBIND [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
