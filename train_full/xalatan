The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as normal.
The dosage of XALATAN should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including XALATAN is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the intraocular  pressure (IOP) lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP.
Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after administration and the maximum effect is reached after 8 to 12 hours.
XALATAN may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart. Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of XALATAN, and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration
