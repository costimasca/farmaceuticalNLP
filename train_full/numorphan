Smaller doses of NUMORPHAN (oxymorphone)  than those recommended below should be used for    debilitated and elderly patients and those with severe liver disease.
Subcutaneous or intramuscular administration: initially 1 mg to 1.5 mg, repeated    every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Intravenous: 0.5 mg initially. In non debilitated    patients the dose can be cautiously increased until satisfactory pain relief    is obtained. For analgesia during labor 0.5 mg to 1 mg intramuscularly is recommended.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
One suppository, 5 mg, every 4 to 6 hours. In non debilitated patients the    dose can be cautiously increased until satisfactory pain relief is obtained.
