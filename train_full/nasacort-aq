Administer NASACORT AQ Nasal Spray by the intranasal route only. Shake NASACORT AQ Nasal Spray well before each use.
The recommended starting and maximum dose is 220 mcg per day as two sprays in each nostril once daily. Titrate an individual patient to the minimum effective dose to reduce the possibility of side effects. When the maximum benefit has been achieved and symptoms have been controlled, reducing the dose to 110 mcg per day (one spray in each nostril once a day) has been shown to be effective in maintaining control of the allergic rhinitis symptoms.
The recommended starting dose is 110 mcg per day given as one spray in each nostril once daily. Children not responding adequately to 110 mcg per day may use 220 mcg (2 sprays in each nostril) once daily. Once symptoms have been controlled, the dosage may be decreased to 110 mcg once daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
