The contents of one single use container (deliverable volume: 0.25 mL) should be instilled into the affected ear twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 7 days.
Wash hands before use. The solution should be warmed, by holding the container in the hands for at least 1 minute, to minimize the dizziness  that may result from the instillation of a cold solution into the ear canal. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then the solution should be instilled. This position should be maintained for at least 1 minute to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.
