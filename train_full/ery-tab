In most patients, ERY-TAB (erythromycin delayed-release tablets) are well absorbed   and may be given without regard to meals.
Adults: The usual dose is 250 mg four times daily in equally spaced    doses. The 333 mg tablet is recommended if dosage is desired every 8 hours.

However, twice-a-day dosing is not recommended when doses larger than 1 g daily    are administered.
Children: Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors    in determining the proper dosage. The usual dosage is 30 to 50 mg/kg/day, in    equally divided doses. For more severe infections, this dose may be doubled    but should not exceed 4 g per day.
