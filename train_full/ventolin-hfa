For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of symptoms associated with bronchospasm, the usual dosage for adults and children is 2 inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours; in some patients, 1 inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient. More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations is not recommended.
For prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm, the usual dosage for adults and children aged 4 years and older is 2 inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.
VENTOLIN HFA should be administered by the orally inhaled route only.
 Priming VENTOLIN HFA is essential to   ensure appropriate albuterol content in each actuation. Prime VENTOLIN HFA   before using for the first time, when the inhaler has not been used for more   than 2 weeks, or when the inhaler has been dropped. To prime VENTOLIN HFA,   release 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well before each   spray.
To ensure proper dosing and to prevent   actuator orifice blockage, wash the actuator with warm water and let it air-dry   completely at least once a week.
