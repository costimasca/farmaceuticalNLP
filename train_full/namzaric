Patient should start NAMZARIC the day following the last dose of memantine hydrochloride and donepezil hydrochloride administered separately.

Except when opened and sprinkled on applesauce, as described above, NAMZARIC capsules should be swallowed whole. NAMZARIC capsules should not be divided, chewed, or crushed.
