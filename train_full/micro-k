The usual dietary intake of potassium by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq    per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires    the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patients. The dose    for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day.    Doses of 40 to 100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium    depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such    that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose. Because of the potential    for gastric irritation (see WARNINGS), Micro-K (potassium chloride extended-release) ®    Extencaps® should be taken with meals and with a full glass of water or    other liquid.
Patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules may sprinkle the contents of the capsule onto a spoonful of soft food. The soft food, such as applesauce or pudding, should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with a glass of cool water or juice to ensure complete swallowing of the microcapsules. The food used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. Any microcapsule/food mixture should be used immediately and not stored for future use.
