For sublingual use only.
One GRASTEK tablet daily.
Administer the first dose of GRASTEK in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. After receiving the first dose of GRASTEK, observe the patient for at least 30 minutes to monitor for signs or symptoms of a severe systemic or a severe local allergic reaction. If the patient tolerates the first dose, the patient may take subsequent doses at home.
Administer GRASTEK to children under adult supervision. Take the tablet from the blister unit after carefully removing the foil with dry hands. Place the tablet immediately under the tongue. Allow it to remain there until completely dissolved. Do not swallow for at least 1 minute. Wash hands after handling the tablet. Do not take the tablet with food or beverage. Food or beverage should not be taken for the following 5 minutes after taking the tablet.
Initiate treatment at least 12 weeks before the expected onset of each grass pollen season and continue treatment throughout the season. For sustained effectiveness for one grass pollen season after cessation of treatment, GRASTEK may be taken daily for three consecutive years (including the intervals between the grass pollen seasons). The safety and efficacy of initiating treatment in season have not been established.
Data regarding the safety of restarting treatment after missing a dose of GRASTEK are limited. In the clinical trials, treatment interruptions for up to seven days were allowed.
Prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine to patients prescribed GRASTEK and instruct them in the proper use of emergency self-injection of epinephrine [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
