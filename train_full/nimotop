DO NOT ADMINISTER NIMOTOP (nimodipine)  CAPSULES INTRAVENOUSLY OR BY OTHER PARENTERAL    ROUTES (see WARNINGS). If Nimotop (nimodipine)  is inadvertently    administered intravenously, clinically significant hypotension may require cardiovascular    support with pressor agents. Specific treatments for calcium channel blocker    overdose should also be given promptly.
Nimotop (nimodipine)  is given orally in the form of ivory colored, soft gelatin 30 mg capsules    for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
The oral dose is 60 mg (two 30 mg capsules) every 4 hours for 21 consecutive    days, preferably not less than one hour before or two hours after meals. Oral    Nimotop® (nimodipine)  therapy should commence within 96 hours of the subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
If the capsule cannot be swallowed, e.g., at the time of surgery, or if the    patient is unconscious, a hole should be made in both ends of the capsule with    an 18 gauge needle, and the contents of the capsule extracted into a syringe.    A parenteral syringe can be used to extract the liquid inside the capsule, but    the liquid should always be transferred to a syringe that cannot accept a needle    and that is designed for administration orally or via a naso-gastric tube or    PEG. To help minimize administration errors, it is recommended that the syringe    used for administration be labeled “Not for IV Use”. The contents    should then be emptied into the patient's in situnaso-gastric tube and    washed down the tube with 30 mL of normal saline (0.9%). The efficacy and safety    of this method of administration has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.  
Patients with hepatic cirrhosis have substantially reduced clearance and approximately    doubled Cmax. Dosage should be reduced to 30 mg every 4 hours, with close monitoring    of blood pressure and heart rate.
