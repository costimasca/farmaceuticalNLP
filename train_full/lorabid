Renal Impairment: Loracarbef may be administered to patients with impaired renal function. The usual dose and schedule may be employed in patients with creatinine clearance levels of 50 ml/min or greater. Patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 49 ml/min may be given half of the recommended dose at the usual dosage interval, or the normal recommended dose at twice the usual dosage interval. Patients with creatinine clearance levels less than 10 ml/min may be treated with the recommended dose given every 3 to 5 days; patients on hemodialysis should receive another dose following dialysis.
When only the serum creatinine is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance (CLcr, ml/min). The equation assumes the patient's renal function is stable.
Males = [(weight in kg) ´ (140 - age)] ¸ [72 ´ serum creatinine (mg/100 ml)] Females = (0.85) ´ (above value) Reconstitution Directions for Oral Suspension
After mixing, the suspension may be kept at room temperature, 59° to 86°F (15° to 30°C), for 14 days without significant loss of potency. Keep tightly closed. Discard unused portion after 14 days.
