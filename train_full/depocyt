DepoCyt is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be used in handling DepoCyt. The use of gloves is recommended. If DepoCyt suspension contacts the skin, wash immediately with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, flush  thoroughly with water.
No further reconstitution or dilution is required. DepoCyt particles have a tendency to settle with time. Vials of DepoCyt should be allowed to warm to room temperature and gently agitated or inverted to re-suspend the particles immediately prior to withdrawal from the vial. Avoid aggressive agitation.
DepoCyt should be withdrawn from the vial immediately before administration. DepoCyt is a single dose vial and does not contain any preservative. DepoCyt should be used within 4 hours of withdrawal from the vial. Unused portions of each vial should be discarded properly [see HOW SUPPLIED/ Storage and Handling]. Do not save any unused portions for later administration. Do not mix DepoCyt with any other medications.
In-line filters must not be used when administering DepoCyt. DepoCyt is administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an intraventricular reservoir or by direct injection into the lumbar sac. DepoCyt should be injected slowly over a period of 1-5 minutes. Following drug administration by lumbar puncture, the patient should be instructed to lie flat for 1 hour. Patients should be observed by the physician for immediate toxic reactions.
For the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis, DepoCyt 50 mg (one vial of DepoCyt) is recommended to be given according to the following schedule:
 
Patients should be started on dexamethasone 4 mg twice a day either by mouth or intravenously for 5 days beginning on the day of DepoCyt injection.
If drug related neurotoxicity develops, the dose should be reduced to 25 mg. If it persists, treatment with DepoCyt should be discontinued.
