GaviLyte- N is usually administered orally, but may be given via nasogastric tube to patients who are unwilling or unable to drink the solution. Ideally, the patient should fast for approximately three or four hours prior to GaviLyte - N administration, but in no case should solid food be given for at least two hours before the solution is given.
Adults: At a rate of 240 mL (8oz.) every 10 minutes, until the rectal effluent is clear or 4 liters are consumed. Pediatric Patients (aged 6 months or greater): At a rate of 25 mL/kg/hour, until the rectal effluent is clear. Rapid drinking of each portion is preferred to drinking small amounts continuously. Nasogastric tube administration: Adults: At a rate of 20 to 30 m L per minute (11 to 1.8 liters per hour). Pediatric Patients (aged 6 months or greater): At a rate of 25 mL/kg/hour, until the rectal effluent is clear.
The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GaviLyte - N administration. Ingestion of 4 liters of GaviLyte - N solution prior to gastrointestinal examination produces satisfactory preparation in over 95% of patients. Various regimens have been used. One method is to schedule patients for examination in midmorning or later, allowing the patients three hours for drinking and an additional one hour period for complete bowel evacuation. Another method is to administer GaviLyte - N on the evening before examination.
Preparation of the solution: GaviLyte - N solution is prepared by filling the container to the 4 liter mark with water and shaking vigorously several times to insure that the ingredients are dissolved. Dissolution is facilitated by using lukewarm water. The solution is more palatable if chilled before administration. However, chilled solution is not recommended for infants. The reconstituted solution should be refrigerated and used within 48 hours. Discard any unused portion.
