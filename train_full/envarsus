To convert from a tacrolimus immediate-release product to ENVARSUS XR, administer an ENVARSUS XR once daily dose that is 80% of the total daily dose of the tacrolimus immediate-release product. Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations and titrate ENVARSUS XR dosage to achieve target whole blood trough concentration ranges of 4 to 11 ng/mL.
Measure tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations at least two times on separate days during the first week after initiation of dosing and after any change in dosage, after a change in co-administration of CYP3A inducers and/or inhibitors, or after a change in renal or hepatic function. When interpreting measured concentrations, consider that the time to achieve tacrolimus steady state is approximately 7 days after initiating or changing the ENVARSUS XR dose.
Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations using a validated assay [e.g., immunoassays or high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC/MS/MS)]. The immunosuppressive activity of tacrolimus is mainly due to the parent drug rather than to its metabolites. Immunoassays may react with metabolites as well as the parent drug. Therefore, whole blood tacrolimus trough concentrations obtained with immunoassays may be numerically higher than concentrations obtained with an assay using HPLC/MS/MS. Comparison of the whole blood tacrolimus trough concentrations of patients to those described in the prescribing information and other published literature must be made with knowledge of the assay method(s) employed.
