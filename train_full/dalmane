Dosage should be individualized for maximal beneficial effects. The usual adult    dosage is 30 mg before retiring. In some patients, 15 mg may suffice. In elderly    and/or debilitated patients, 15 mg is usually sufficient for a therapeutic response    and it is therefore recommended that therapy be initiated with this dosage.
