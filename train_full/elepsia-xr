ELEPSIA XR is administered once daily.
Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 1,000 mg once daily. The once daily dosage may be adjusted in increments of 1,000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended once daily dose of 3,000 mg.
ELEPSIA XR should be taken whole; do not split or cut tablets.
ELEPSIA XR is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Recommended doses and adjustment for patients with mild renal impairment are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:
