In patients with essential hypertension, the recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated, as needed to a maximum of 16 mg per day. The usual maintenance dose range is 4 mg to 8 mg administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses.
The recommended initial daily dosage of ACEON for the elderly is 4 mg daily, given in one or two divided doses. Experience with ACEON is limited in the elderly at doses exceeding 8 mg. Dosages above 8 mg should be administered with careful blood pressure monitoring and dose titration [see Use In Specific Populations].
In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension can occur following the initial dose of ACEON. Consider reducing the dose of diuretic prior to starting ACEON [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
In patients with stable coronary artery disease, ACEON should be given at an initial dose of 4 mg once daily for 2 weeks, and then increased as tolerated, to a maintenance dose of 8 mg once daily. In elderly patients (greater than 70 years), ACEON should be given as a 2 mg dose once daily in the first week, followed by 4 mg once daily in the second week and 8 mg once daily for maintenance dose if tolerated.
Perindoprilat elimination is decreased in renally impaired patients. ACEON is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance  <30 mL/min. For patients with lesser degrees of impairment, the initial dosage should be 2 mg/day and dosage should not exceed 8 mg/day. During dialysis, perindopril is removed with the same clearance as in patients with normal renal function.
