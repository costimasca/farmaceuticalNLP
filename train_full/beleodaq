The recommended dosage of Beleodaq is 1,000 mg/m² administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once daily on Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. Cycles can be repeated every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Table 1 displays the recommended Beleodaq dosage modifications for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Base dosage adjustments for thrombocytopenia and neutropenia on platelet and absolute neutrophil nadir (lowest value) counts in the preceding cycle of therapy.
Monitor complete blood counts at baseline and weekly. Perform serum chemistry tests, including renal and hepatic functions prior to the start of the first dose of each cycle.
Table 1: Dosage Modifications for Hematologic and Non-Hematologic Toxicities

As with other potentially  cytotoxic anticancer agents, exercise care in the handling and preparation of solutions prepared with Beleodaq.
