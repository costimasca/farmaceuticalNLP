It is important that HYCODAN oral solution is measured with an accurate measuring device (see PATIENT INFORMATION). A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, especially when a half a teaspoon is to be measured. It is strongly recommended that an accurate measuring device be used. A pharmacist can provide an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose.
One (1) tablet or 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of the oral solution every 4 to 6 hours as needed; do not exceed six (6) tablets or 30 mL (6 teaspoonfuls) in 24 hours.
One-half (1/2) tablet or 2.5 mL (1/2 teaspoonful) of the oral solution every 4 to 6 hours as needed; do not exceed three (3) tablets or 15 mL (3 teaspoonfuls) in 24 hours.
