Amiloride HCl should be administered with food.
Amiloride HCl, one 5 mg tablet daily, should be added to the usual antihypertensive   or diuretic dosage of a kaliuretic diuretic. The dosage may be increased to   10 mg per day, if necessary. More than two 5 mg tablets of amiloride HCl daily   usually are not needed, and there is little controlled experience with such   doses. If persistent hypokalemia is documented with 10 mg, the dose can be increased   to 15 mg, then 20 mg, with careful monitoring of electrolytes.
In treating patients with congestive heart failure after an initial diuresis    has been achieved, potassium loss may also decrease and the need for amiloride   HCl should be re-evaluated. Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Maintenance   therapy may be on an intermittent basis.
If it is necessary to use amiloride HCl alone (see INDICATIONS), the    starting dosage should be one 5 mg tablet daily. This dosage may be increased    to 10 mg per day, if necessary. More than two 5 mg tablets usually are not needed,    and there is little controlled experience with such doses. If persistent hypokalemia    is documented with 10 mg, the dose can be increased to 15 mg, then 20 mg, with    careful monitoring of electrolytes.
