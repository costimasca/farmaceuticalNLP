CARMOLÂ® HC (Hydrocortisone Acetate Cream DSP, 1%) is generally applied    to the affected area as a thin film two to four times daily, depending on the    severity of the condition. Occlusive dressings may be used for the management    of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. If an infection develops, the use of    occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy    instituted.
