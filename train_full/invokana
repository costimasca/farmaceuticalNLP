The recommended starting dose of INVOKANA (canagliflozin) is 100 mg once daily, taken before the first meal of the day. In patients tolerating INVOKANA 100 mg once daily who have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater and require additional glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 300 mg once daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ,  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PATIENT INFORMATION].
In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of INVOKANA is recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , Use In Specific Populations and PATIENT INFORMATION].
Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of INVOKANA and periodically thereafter.
The dose of INVOKANA is limited to 100 mg once daily in patients with moderate renal impairment with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 .
Initiation of INVOKANA is not recommended in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 .
Use of INVOKANA is not recommended when eGFR is persistently less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and  Use In Specific Populations].
INVOKANA is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].
If an inducer of UGTs (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) is co-administered with INVOKANA, consider increasing the dosage to 300 mg once daily in patients currently tolerating INVOKANA 100 mg once daily who have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater and require additional glycemic control [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
Consider another antihyperglycemic agent in patients with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT inducer.
