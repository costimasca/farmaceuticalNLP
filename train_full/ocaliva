The recommended starting dosage of OCALIVA is 5 mg orally once daily in adult patients who have not achieved an adequate biochemical  response to an appropriate dosage of UDCA for at least 1 year or are intolerant to UDCA [see Clinical Studies].
If an adequate reduction in ALP and/or total bilirubin has not been achieved after 3 months of OCALIVA 5 mg once daily, and the patient is tolerating OCALIVA, increase the dosage of OCALIVA to 10 mg once daily [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies].
The maximum recommended dosage of OCALIVA is 10 mg once daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
For patients with intolerable pruritus on OCALIVA, consider one or more of the following:
Consider discontinuing OCALIVA treatment in patients who continue to experience persistent, intolerable pruritus.
Treatment with OCALIVA in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment should be initiated and monitored by a healthcare provider with experience managing PBC.
The recommended starting dosage of OCALIVA for moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment is 5 mg once weekly. If an adequate reduction in ALP and/or total bilirubin has not been achieved after 3 months of OCALIVA 5 mg once weekly, and the patient is tolerating the drug, increase the dosage of OCALIVA to 5 mg twice weekly (at least three days apart) and subsequently to 10 mg twice weekly (at least three days apart) depending on response and tolerability [see Use in Specific Populations].
Monitor patients during treatment with OCALIVA for the occurrence of liver-related adverse reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Weigh the potential risks against the benefits of continuing treatment with OCALIVA in patients who have experienced clinically significant liver-related adverse reactions.
