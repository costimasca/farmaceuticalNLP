Inspect the bag and contents prior to administration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Inspect Smoflipid to ensure that the emulsion has not separated. The lipid emulsion should be a homogenous liquid with a milky appearance. Discard the bag if there appears to be a phase separation of the emulsion, or if any signs of discoloration, particulates, and/or leakage are observed.



For Single Use Only
Discard unused portion.
Simultaneous transfer of amino acid injection, dextrose injection, and Smoflipid to  the PN container is also permitted. Use gentle agitation during admixing to minimize localized concentration effects; shake bags gently after each addition.
Discard the admixture if any of these are observed.
