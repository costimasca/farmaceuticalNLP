Application may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive   individuals. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue   therapy, or the dosing has been reduced to a lower concentration (in patients   with psoriasis) or to an interval the patient can tolerate, therapy can be resumed,   or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the   patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application should   be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response   and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once daily   dosing frequencies.
For psoriasis: It is recommended that treatment start with TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel)   0.05% Gel, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated.   Apply TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel)  Gel once a day, in the evening, to psoriatic lesions,   using enough (2 mg/cm²) to cover only the lesion with a thin film to no   more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application,   the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they   should be applied at least an hour before application of TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel)  Gel.   Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of   tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel)  Gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis.
For acne: Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin   film of TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel)  Gel 0.1% (2 mg/cm²) once a day, in the evening,   to the skin where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected   area. TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel)  Gel was investigated for up to 12 weeks during clinical trials for acne.
