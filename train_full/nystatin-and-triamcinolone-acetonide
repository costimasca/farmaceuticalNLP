Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream is usually applied to the affected areas twice daily in the morning and the evening by gently and thoroughly massaging the preparation into the skin. The cream should be discontinued if symptoms persist after 25 days of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).
Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream should not be used with occlusive dressings.
