FACTIVE can be taken with or without food and should be swallowed whole with a liberal amount of liquid.  The recommended dose of FACTIVE is 320 mg daily, according to the following table (Table 4).
Table 4. Recommended Dosage Regimen of FACTIVE   The clinical decision regarding the use of a 5 day or 7 day regimen should be guided by results of the initial sputum culture. 
*MDRSP: multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, includes isolates previously known as PRSP (penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and are strains resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics: penicillin (MIC ≥2 µg/mL), 2nd generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
The recommended dose and duration of FACTIVE should not be exceeded (see Table 2).
 Dose adjustment in patients with creatinine clearance >40 mL/min is not required. Modification of the dosage is recommended for patients with creatinine  clearance ?40 mL/min. Table 5 provides dosage guidelines for use in patients with renal impairment.
Table 5. Recommended Doses for Patients with Renal Impairment 
Patients requiring routine hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) should receive 160 mg every 24 hours.
When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance.

 No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.
No dosage adjustment is recommended.
