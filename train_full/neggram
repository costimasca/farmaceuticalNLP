Antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum; sucralfate; divalent or     trivalent cations such as iron; multivitamins containing zinc; or VidexÂ®     (Didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets of the pediatric powder for oral solution     should not be taken within the two-hour period before or within the two-hour     period after taking nalidixic acid.
The recommended dosage for initial therapy in adults is 1 g administered four     times daily for one or two weeks (total daily dose, 4 g). For prolonged therapy,     the total daily dose may be reduced to 2 g after the initial treatment period.     Underdosage during initial treatment may predispose to emergence of bacterial resistance.
Until further experience is gained, NegGram should not be administered to infants     younger than three months. Dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age and     under should be calculated on the basis of body weight. The recommended total     daily dosage for initial therapy is 25 mg/lb/day (55 mg/kg/day), administered     in four equally divided doses. For prolonged therapy, the total daily dose may     be reduced to 15 mg/lb/day (33 mg/kg/day). NegGram Suspension or NegGram Caplets     of 250 mg may be used. One 250 mg caplet is equivalent to one teaspoon (5mL)     of the suspension.
