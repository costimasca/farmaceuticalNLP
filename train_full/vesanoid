The recommended dose is 45 mg/m2/day administered as two evenly   divided doses until complete remission is documented. Therapy should be discontinued   30 days after achievement of complete remission or after 90 days of treatment,   whichever occurs first.
If after initiation of treatment of VESANOID (tretinoin)  the presence of the t(15;17) translocation is not confirmed by cytogenetics and/or by polymerase chain reaction studies and the patient has not responded to VESANOID (tretinoin) , alternative therapy appropriate for acute myelogenous leukemia should be considered.
VESANOID (tretinoin)  is for the induction of remission only. Optimal consolidation   or maintenance regimens have not been determined. All patients should, therefore,   receive a standard consolidation and/or maintenance chemotherapy regimen for   APL after induction therapy with VESANOID (tretinoin) , unless otherwise contraindicated.
