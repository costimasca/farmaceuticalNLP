DO NOT INJECT [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]
Apply Oraqix on the gingival margin around the selected teeth using the blunt-tipped applicator included in the package. Wait 30 seconds, and then fill the periodontal pockets with Oraqix using the blunt-tipped applicator until the gel becomes visible at the gingival margin. Wait another 30 seconds before starting treatment. A longer waiting time does not enhance the anesthesia. Anesthetic effect, as assessed by probing of pocket depths, has a duration of approximately 20 minutes (individual overall range 14 â€“ 31 minutes). If the anesthesia starts to wear off, Oraqix may be re-applied if needed. Typically, one cartridge (1.7g) or less of Oraqix will be sufficient for one quadrant of the dentition.
When administered, Oraqix should be a liquid. If it has formed a gel, it should be placed in a refrigerator (do not freeze) until it becomes a liquid again. When in the liquid state, the air bubble visible in the cartridge will move if the cartridge is tilted.
The maximum recommended dose of Oraqix at one treatment session is 5 cartridges, i.e., 8.5g gel.
