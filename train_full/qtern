In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition prior to initiation of QTERN [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and Use in Specific Populations].
The recommended dose of QTERN is a 10 mg dapagliflozin/5 mg saxagliptin tablet taken orally once daily in the morning with or without food.
Do not split or cut QTERN tablets.
Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of QTERN therapy and periodically thereafter.
Do not initiate QTERN in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m².
Discontinue QTERN if eGFR falls persistently below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use in Specific Populations].
QTERN is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].
Do not coadminister QTERN with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
