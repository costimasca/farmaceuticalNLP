Prior to treating patients with ADZENYS XR-ODT, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically re-evaluate the need for ADZENYS XR-ODT use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and Drug Abuse And Dependence].
ADZENYS XR-ODT may be taken with or without food. Individualize the dosage according to the therapeutic needs and response of the patient.
ADZENYS XR-ODT should be taken as follows:
The recommended starting dosage is 6.3 mg once daily in the morning. Increase in increments of 3.1 mg or 6.3 mg at weekly intervals. The maximum recommended dose is 18.8 mg daily for patients 6 to 12 years, and 12.5 mg daily for patients 13 to 17 years [see Use In Specific Populations, Clinical Studies].
The recommended dose is ADZENYS XR-ODT 12.5 mg daily.
Patients taking ADDERALL XR may be switched to ADZENYS XR-ODT at the equivalent dose taken once daily [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Refer to Table 1 for equivalent doses of ADZENYS XR-ODT and ADDERALL XR. ADDERALL XR (dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules) is also referred to as mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine product extended-release capsules (MAS ER).

If switching from any other amphetamine products, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with ADZENYS XR-ODT using the titration schedule [see Pediatric Patients].
Do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Agents that alter urinary pH can impact urinary excretion and alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents (e.g., ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels, while alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) increase blood levels. Adjust ADZENYS XR-ODT dosage accordingly [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
