The recommended dose of NESINA is 25 mg once daily. NESINA may be taken with or without food.
No dose adjustment of NESINA is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl]  ≥ 60 mL/min).
The dose of NESINA is 12.5 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl  ≥ 30 to  < 60 mL/min).
The dose of NESINA is 6.25 mg once daily for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl  ≥ 15 to  < 30 mL/min) or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl  < 15 mL/min or requiring  hemodialysis). NESINA may be administered without regard to the timing of  dialysis. NESINA has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal  dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Because there is a need for dose adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of NESINA therapy and periodically thereafter.
