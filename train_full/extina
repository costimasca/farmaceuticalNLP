EXTINA® Foam should be applied to the affected area(s) twice daily for four weeks.
Hold the container upright, and dispense EXTINA® Foam into the cap of the can or other cool surface in an amount sufficient to cover the affected area(s). Dispensing directly onto hands is not recommended, as the foam will begin to melt immediately upon contact with warm skin. Pick up small amounts of EXTINA® Foam with the fingertips, and gently massage into the affected area(s) until the foam disappears. For hair-bearing areas, part the hair, so that EXTINA® Foam may be applied directly to the skin (rather than on the hair).
Avoid contact with the eyes and other mucous membranes. EXTINA® Foam is not for ophthalmic, oral or intravaginal use.
