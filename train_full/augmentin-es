AUGMENTIN ES-600, 600 mg/5 mL, does not contain the same amount of clavulanic   acid (as the potassium salt) as any of the other suspensions of AUGMENTIN. AUGMENTIN   ES-600 contains 42.9 mg of clavulanic acid per 5 mL, whereas the 200 mg/5 mL   suspension of AUGMENTIN contains 28.5 mg of clavulanic acid per 5 mL and the   400 mg/5 mL suspension contains 57 mg of clavulanic acid per 5 mL. Therefore,   the 200 mg/5 mL and 400 mg/5 mL suspensions of AUGMENTIN should not be substituted   for AUGMENTIN ES-600, as they are not interchangeable. 
Pediatric patients 3 months and older: Based on the amoxicillin component    (600 mg/5 mL), the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600 is 90 mg/kg/day divided   every 12 hours, administered for 10 days (see chart below).
 
Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg and more: Experience with AUGMENTIN   ES-600 (600 mg/5 mL formulation) in this group is not available.
Adults: Experience with AUGMENTIN ES-600 (600 mg/5 mL formulation) in   adults is not available and adults who have difficulty swallowing should not   be given AUGMENTIN ES-600 (600 mg/5 mL) in place of the 500-mg or 875-mg tablet   of AUGMENTIN.
Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic function   monitored at regular intervals. (See WARNINGS.)
Prepare a suspension at time of dispensing as follows: Tap bottle until all   the powder flows freely. Add approximately 2/3 of the total amount of water   for reconstitution (see table below) and shake vigorously to suspend   powder. Add remainder of the water and again shake vigorously.
AUGMENTIN ES-600 (600 mg/5 mL Suspension)  
Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 600 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate and   42.9 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.
NOTE: SHAKE ORAL SUSPENSION WELL BEFORE USING.
Information for the Pharmacist: For patients who wish to alter the taste   of AUGMENTIN ES-600, immediately after reconstitution 1 drop of FLAVORxâ„¢   (apple, banana cream, bubble gum, cherry, or watermelon flavor) may be added   for every 5 mL of AUGMENTIN ES-600. The resulting suspension is stable for 10   days under refrigeration. Other than the 5 flavors listed above, GlaxoSmithKline   has not evaluated the stability of AUGMENTIN ES-600 when mixed with other flavors   distributed by FLAVORx.
Administration: To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance,   AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be taken at the start of a meal. Absorption of clavulanate   potassium may be enhanced when AUGMENTIN ES-600 is administered at the start   of a meal.
