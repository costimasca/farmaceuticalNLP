ABILIFY MAINTENA is only to be administered by intramuscular injection by a healthcare professional. The recommended starting and maintenance dose of ABILIFY MAINTENA is 400 mg monthly (no sooner than 26 days after the previous injection).
For patients who have never taken aripiprazole, establish tolerability with oral aripiprazole prior to initiating treatment with ABILIFY MAINTENA. Due to the half-life of oral aripiprazole, it may take up to 2 weeks to fully assess tolerability.
After the first ABILIFY MAINTENA injection, administer oral aripiprazole (10 mg to 20 mg) for 14 consecutive days to achieve therapeutic aripiprazole concentrations during initiation of therapy. For patients already stable on another oral antipsychotic (and known to tolerate aripiprazole), after the first ABILIFY MAINTENA injection, continue treatment with the antipsychotic for 14 consecutive days to maintain therapeutic antipsychotic concentrations during initiation of therapy.
If there are adverse reactions with the 400 mg dosage, consider reducing the dosage to 300 mg once monthly.
If the second or third doses are missed:
If the fourth or subsequent doses are missed:
Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors for greater than 14 days (see Table 1). Dosage adjustments for 200 mg and 160 mg are obtained only by using the 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials for intramuscular deltoid or gluteal injection.
If the CYP3A4 inhibitor or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn, the ABILIFY MAINTENA dosage may need to be increased [see Dosage Overview for the Treatment of Schizophrenia above].
Avoid the concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with ABILIFY MAINTENA for greater than 14 days because the blood levels of aripiprazole are decreased and may be below the effective levels.
Dosage adjustments are not recommended for patients with concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP2D6 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers for less than 14 days.
Table 1: Dose Adjustments of ABILIFY MAINTENA in Patients who are known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers and Patients Taking Concomitant CYP2D6 Inhibitors, 3A4 Inhibitors, and/or CYP3A4 Inducers for Greater than 14 days 
ABILIFY MAINTENA comes in two types of kits. See instructions for reconstitution/injection/disposal procedures for 1) Pre-filled Dual Chamber Syringe, and 2) Vials.
There are two aripiprazole formulations for intramuscular use with different dosages, dosing frequencies, and indications. ABILIFY MAINTENA is a long-acting aripiprazole formulation with 4 week dosing intervals indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. In contrast, aripiprazole injection (9.75 mg per vial) is a short-acting formulation indicated for agitation in patients with schizophrenia or mania. Do not substitute these products. Refer to the prescribing information for aripiprazole injection for more information about aripiprazole injection.
ABILIFY MAINTENA comes in two types of kits. See instructions for reconstitution/injection/disposal procedures for 1) Pre-filled Dual Chamber Syringe available in 300 mg or 400 mg strength syringes [see section below], and 2) Single-use vials available in 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials [see  section below].
The 200 mg and 160 mg dosage adjustments are obtained only by using the 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials.
For deep intramuscular deltoid or gluteal injection by healthcare professionals only. Do not administer by any other route. Inject full syringe contents immediately following reconstitution. Administer once monthly.
Lay out and confirm that components listed below are provided in the kit:
Reconstitute at room temperature.
a) Push plunger rod slightly to engage threads. And then, rotate plunger rod until the rod stops rotating to release diluent. After plunger rod is at complete stop, middle stopper will be at the indicator line (See Figure 1).
Figure 1 
b) Vertically shake the syringe vigorously for 20 seconds until drug is uniformly milky-white (See Figure 2).
Figure 2 
c) Visually inspect the syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted ABILIFY MAINTENA suspension should appear to be a uniform, homogeneous suspension that is opaque and milky-white in color.
Use appropriate aseptic techniques throughout injection procedure. For deep intramuscular injection only.
a) Twist and pull off Over-cap and Tip-cap (See Figure 3).
Figure 3 
b) Select appropriate needle (See Figure 4).
