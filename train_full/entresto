A starting dose of 24/26 mg twice-daily is recommended for patients not currently taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and for patients previously taking low doses of these agents. Double the dose of ENTRESTO every 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.
A starting dose of 24/26 mg twice-daily is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR  < 30 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²). Double the dose of ENTRESTO every 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.
No starting dose adjustment is needed for mild or moderate renal impairment.
A starting dose of 24/26 mg twice-daily is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B classification). Double the dose of ENTRESTO every 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.
