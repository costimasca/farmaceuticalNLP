The recommended adult dose of intravenous Thallous Chloride Tl-201 for planar myocardial imaging is 37 to 74 MBq (1 to 2 mCi). The recommended intravenous doses for SPECT myocardial imaging are 74 to 111 MBq (2 to 3 mCi). The efficacy of a 1.0 mCi dose for SPECT imaging has not been well established.
For the localization of parathyroid hyperactivity, Thallous Chloride Tl-201 may be administered before, with or after a minimal dose of a thyroid imaging agent such as sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m or sodium iodide I-123 to enable thyroid subtraction imaging.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if contents are turbid.
Waterproof gloves should be worn during the handling procedures.
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.
With a shielded sterile syringe, aseptically withdraw the material for use.
For resting Thallous Chloride Tl-201 studies, imaging should begin 10 to 20 minutes after injection. Myocardial-to-background ratios are improved when patients are injected upright and in the fasting state; the upright position reduces the hepatic and gastric Thallium Tl-201 concentration.
When utilized in conjunction with exercise stress testing, Thallous Chloride Tl-201 should be administered at the inception of a period of maximum stress which is sustained for approximately 30 seconds after injection. Imaging should begin within ten minutes after administration to obtain maximum target-to-background ratios. Several investigators have reported that within two hours after the completion of stress testing the target-to-background ratios may decrease significantly in lesions that are attributable to transient ischemia.
The estimated absorbed radiation doses4 at calibration time to an    average patient (70 kg) from an intravenous injection of Thallous Chloride Tl-201    are shown in Table 4.
