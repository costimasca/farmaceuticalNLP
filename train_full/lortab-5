Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related.
The usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage for adults should not exceed 8 tablets.
