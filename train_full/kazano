Assess renal function prior to initiation of KAZANO and periodically thereafter.
KAZANO is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see CONTRAINDICATIONS and  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
KAZANO is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m² because these patients require a lower daily dosage of alogliptin than what is available in the fixed combination KAZANO product.
Discontinue KAZANO at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Reevaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart KAZANO if renal function is stable [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
