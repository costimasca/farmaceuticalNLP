Fluothane (halothane)  may be administered by the nonrebreathing technique, partial rebreathing, or closed technique. The induction dose varies from patient to patient but is usually within the range of 0.5% to 3%. The maintenance dose varies from 0.5% to 1.5%. 
Fluothane (halothane)  may be administered with either oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. 
Fluothane (halothane)  should not be kept indefinitely in vaporizer bottles not specifically designed for its use. Thymol does not volatilize along with Fluothane (halothane)  and, therefore, accumulates in the vaporizer and may, in time, impart a yellow color to the remaining liquid or to wicks in vaporizers. The development of such discoloration may be used as an indicator that the vaporizer should be drained and cleaned, and the discolored Fluothane (halothane, USP) discarded. Accumulation of thymol may be removed by washing with diethyl ether. After cleaning a wick or vaporizer, make certain all the diethyl ether has been removed before reusing the equipment to avoid introducing ether into the system. 
Because of the more rapid uptake of Fluothane (halothane)  and the increased blood concentration required for anesthesia in younger patients, the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) 1 values will decrease with age as follows:
