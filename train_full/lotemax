Steroid Responsive Disease Treatment: Apply one to two drops of LOTEMAX (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension)     into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) four times daily. During the    initial treatment within the first week, the dosing may be increased, up to    1 drop every hour, if necessary. Care should be taken not to discontinue therapy    prematurely. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient    should be re-evaluated (See PRECAUTIONS).
Post-Operative Inflammation: Apply one to two drops of LOTEMAX (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension)  into    the conjunctival sac of the operated eye(s) four times daily beginning 24 hours    after surgery and continuing throughout the first 2 weeks of the post-operative    period.
