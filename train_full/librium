 Because of the wide range of clinical indications for Librium (chlordiazepoxide) , the optimum    dosage varies with the diagnosis and response of the individual patient. The    dosage, therefore, should be individualized for maximum beneficial effects.

Preoperative Apprehension and Anxiety: On days preceding surgery, 5 to 10 mg    orally, 3 or 4 times daily. If used as preoperative medication, 50 to 100 mg    IM* 1 hour prior to surgery.

For the relief of withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, the parenteral form*    is usually used initially. If the drug is administered orally, the suggested    initial dose is 50 to 100 mg, to be followed by repeated doses as needed until    agitation is controlled up to 300 mg per day. Dosage should then be reduced    to maintenance levels.
