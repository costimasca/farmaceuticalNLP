Ensure the face is clean, makeup and contact lenses are removed. Once nightly, place one drop of LATISSE® (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.03% on the disposable sterile applicator supplied with the package and apply evenly along the skin of the upper eyelid margin at the base of the eyelashes. The upper lid margin in the area of lash growth should feel lightly moist without runoff. Blot any excess solution runoff outside the upper eyelid margin with a tissue or other absorbent cloth. Dispose of the applicator after one use. Repeat for the opposite eyelid margin using a new sterile applicator.
Do not reuse applicators and do not use any other brush/applicator to apply LATISSE® .
Do not apply to the lower eyelash line [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and PATIENT INFORMATION].
Additional applications of LATISSE® will not increase the growth of eyelashes.
Upon discontinuation of treatment, eyelash growth is expected to return to its pre-treatment level.
