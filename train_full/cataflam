Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of CATAFLAM速 (diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets) and other treatment options before deciding to use CATAFLAM. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).
After observing the response to initial therapy with CATAFLAM, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

For the relief of osteoarthritis the recommended dosage is 100-150 mg/day in divided doses, 50 mg twice a day. or three times a day.
For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis the recommended dosage is 150-200 mg/day in divided doses, 50 mg three times a day or four times a day.
