The recommended starting dose of NORTHERA is 100 mg, taken orally three times daily: upon arising in the morning, at midday, and in the late afternoon at least 3 hours prior to bedtime (to reduce the potential for supine hypertension during sleep). Administer NORTHERA consistently, either with food or without food. Take NORTHERA capsule whole. Titrate to symptomatic response, in increments of 100 mg three times daily every 24 to 48 hours up to a maximum dose of 600 mg three times daily (i.e., a maximum total daily dose of 1,800 mg).
Monitor supine blood pressure prior to initiating NORTHERA and after increasing the dose.
Patients who miss a dose of NORTHERA should take their next scheduled dose.
