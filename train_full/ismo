(SEE INDICATIONS AND USAGE)
The recommended regimen of Ismo (isosorbide mononitrate)  tablets is 20 mg (one tablet) twice daily,    with the two doses given 7 hours apart. For most patients, this can be accomplished    by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later. Dosage    adjustments are not necessary for elderly patients or patients with altered    renal or hepatic function. As noted above (CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY), multiple studies of organic nitrates have shown that    maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels results in refractory tolerance.    The dosing regimen for Ismo (isosorbide mononitrate)  tablets provides a daily nitrate-free interval to    avoid the development of this tolerance. As also noted under CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY, well-controlled studies have shown that tolerance to Ismo (isosorbide mononitrate)     tablets is avoided when using the twice-daily regimen in which the two doses    are given 7 hours apart. This regimen has been shown to have antianginal efficacy    beginning 1 hour after the first dose and lasting at least 5 hours after the    second dose. The duration (if any) of antianginal activity beyond 12 hours has    not been studied; large controlled studies with other nitrates suggest that    no dosing regimen should be expected to provide more than about 12 hours of    continuous antianginal efficacy per day.
In clinical trials, Ismo (isosorbide mononitrate)  tablets have been administered in a variety of regimens. Single doses less than 20 mg have not been adequately studied, while single doses greater than 20 mg have demonstrated no greater efficacy than doses of 20 mg.
