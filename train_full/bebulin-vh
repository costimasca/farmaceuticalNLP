One International Unit (IU) of Factor IX activity/kg will increase the plasma level of Factor IX by 0.8%. Accordingly, the following formula is provided for dosage calculations:
Number of Factor IX IU required = bodyweight (kg) x desired Factor IX increase (% of normal) x 1.2.
The response to treatment will vary from patient to patient. Exact dosage determination should be based on localization and extent of hemorrhage, and the level of Factor IX to be achieved. Close laboratory monitoring of the Factor IX level is required to determine proper dosage, particularly with severe hemorrhage and major surgery. Larger doses than those derived from the above formula may be required, particularly if treatment is delayed.
Approximate desired Factor IX levels, typical initial doses, and the average duration of treatment are suggested in Table 3. For minor bleeding, a single dose will usually be sufficient; otherwise a second dose may be given after 24 hours. More severe hemorrhage will require several doses at approximately 24-hour intervals. For maintenance therapy, usually two thirds of the initial dose is infused.
Table 3. Management of Specific Types of Bleeding 
Dosage guidelines for surgical procedures are suggested in Table 4. Administer preoperative loading dose one hour prior to surgery. Depending on the type of surgery, continue replacement therapy over one to several weeks until adequate wound healing is achieved. The average treatment interval will initially be 12 hours, while in the later postoperative period, 24 hours is adequate.
Table 4: Management of Surgical Procedures 
For tooth extraction, the same initial dose as for minor surgery is recommended and one infusion should be sufficient. In case of extraction of several teeth, replacement therapy for up to one week may be necessary using the same doses as for minor surgery.8-11
