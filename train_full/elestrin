Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a  postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.
A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
The gel is applied onto the skin in a thin layer. The recommended area of application is the upper arm to shoulder (approximately 320 cmÂ²).
ELESTRIN is applied once daily to the upper arm for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause using a metered-dose pump which delivers 0.87 gram of estradiol gel (0.52 mg estradiol) per actuation (1 pump).
Patients should be started with the lowest effective dose of ELESTRIN, which is one pump per day (0.87 g per day, which contains 0.52 mg of estradiol).
Subsequent dosage adjustment may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider.
