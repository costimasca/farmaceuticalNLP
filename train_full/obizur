1. Once all vials have been reconstituted, connect a large syringe to the vial adapter by gently pushing the syringe tip down onto the luer lock in the center of the vial adapter, and turning clockwise until the syringe is secured.
2. Invert the vial; push the air in the syringe into the vial and withdraw the reconstituted OBIZUR into the syringe (Figure I).

3. Unscrew the large syringe counterclockwise from the vial adapter, and repeat this process for all reconstituted vials of OBIZUR until the total volume to be administered is reached.
4. Administer the reconstituted OBIZUR intravenously at a rate of 1 to 2 mL per minute.
