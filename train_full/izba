The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. IZBA (travoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.003% should not be administered more than once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may decrease the intraocular pressure lowering effect.
Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 2 hours after the first administration with maximum effect reached after 12 hours.
IZBA may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.
