The recommended dose of CYCLOSET is 1.6 mg to 4.8 mg administered once daily within two hours after waking in the morning. CYCLOSET should be taken with food to potentially reduce gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea.
CYCLOSET should be initiated at one tablet (0.8 mg) and increased by one tablet per week until a maximum daily dose of 6 tablets (4.8 mg) or until the maximal tolerated number of tablets between 2 and 6 per day is reached.
CYCLOSET dose should not exceed 1.6 mg once daily during concomitant use of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin). Avoid concomitant use of CYCLOSET and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antimycotics, HIV protease inhibitors) and ensure adequate washout of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor drug before initiating CYCLOSET treatment [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
