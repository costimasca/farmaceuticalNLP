 The recommended dose of Duagen (dutasteride)  is 1 capsule (0.5 mg) taken orally once a day. The capsules should be swallowed 
 whole. Duagen (dutasteride)  may be administered with or without food. 
 No dosage adjustment is necessary for subjects with renal impairment or for the elderly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics: Geriatric and Renal Impairment). Due to the absence of data in patients with hepatic impairment, no dosage recommendation can be made (see PRECAUTIONS: General).
