Inject the contents of the ampule or vial rapidly into the antecubital vein,    after taking precautions to avoid extravasation. A scalp (butterfly) needle    attached to a small syringe is ideal for administration. A syringe, filled with    fluorescein, is attached to transparent tubing and a 25 gauge scalp vein needle    for injection.
Insert the needle and draw the patient's blood to the hub of the syringe so    that a small air bubble separates the patient's blood in the tubing from    the fluorescein. With the room lights on, slowly inject the blood back into    the vein while watching the skin over the needle tip. If the needle has extravasated,    the patient's blood will be seen to bulge the skin and the injection should    be stopped before any fluorescein is injected. When assured that extravasation    has not occurred, the room light may be turned off and the fluorescein injection    completed. Luminescence appears in the retina and choroidal vessels in 9 to    14 seconds and can be observed by standard viewing equipment. If potential allergy    is suspected, an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous    administration, i.e., 0.05 mL injection intradermally to be evaluated 30 to    60 minutes following injection. For pediatric patients, the dose is calculated    on the basis of 35 mg for each ten pounds of body weight. Parenteral drug products    should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration, whenever    solution and container permit.
