Intramuscular: Adults and older children: For severe hypomagnesemia,    1 to 5 g (2 to 10 mLof 50% solution) daily in divided doses; administration    is repeated daily until serum levels have returned to normal. If deficiency    is not severe, 1 g (2 mL of 50% solution) can be given once or twice daily.    Serum magnesium levels should serve as a guide to continued dosage.
Intravenous: 1 to 4 g magnesium sulfate (magnesium sulfate (magnesium sulfate injection)  injection)  may be given intravenously in    10% to 20% solution, but only with great caution; the rate should not exceed    1.5 mL of 10% solution or equivalent per minute until relaxation is obtained.
Intravenous Infusion: 4 g in 250 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection at a rate    not exceeding 3 mL per minute.
Usual Dose Range: 1 to 40 g daily.
Electrolyte Replenisher: Intramuscular 1 to 2 g in 50% solution four    times a day until serum magnesium is within normal limits.
Usual Pediatric Dose: Intramuscular 20 to 40 mg per kg of body weight    in a 20% solution repeated as necessary.
For Eclampsia: Initially 1 to 2 g in 25% or 50% solution is given intramuscularly.    Subsequently, 1 g is given every 30 minutes until relief is obtained. The blood    pressure should be monitored after each injection.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
