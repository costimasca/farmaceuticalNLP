The recommended daily dose in children and adults is 1-5 mg/kg body weight    per day. The usual effective dose is 1-2 mg/kg/day but higher doses may be required,    and the dose should be individualized. Response is not often immediate, and    a minimum trial of three to six months should be given. Following remission,    some patients may be maintained without the drug; others may be maintained on    an established lower daily dosage. A continued maintenance dose is usually necessary    in patients with congenital aplastic anemia.
