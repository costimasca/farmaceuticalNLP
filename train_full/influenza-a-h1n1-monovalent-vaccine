Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (see DESCRIPTION), whenever suspension and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. Any vaccine that has been frozen or is suspected of being frozen must not be used.
When using a preservative-free, single-dose syringe, shake the syringe thoroughly and administer the dose immediately.
When using the multi-dose vial, shake the vial thoroughly before withdrawing each dose, and administer the dose immediately. Between uses, store the vial at 2 -8°C (36-46°F) (see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling). Once the stopper has been pierced, the vial must be discarded within 28 days.
Clinical studies are ongoing with Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine to determine the optimal dosage, number of doses and schedule. 
Available data show that children 9 years of age and younger are largely serologically naïve to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.1 Based upon these data Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine should be administered as follows:
Children 6 months through 35 months of age should receive two 0.25 mL doses approximately 4 weeks apart.2
Children 36 months through 9 years of age should receive two 0.5 mL doses approximately 4 weeks apart.2
Children 10 years of age and older should receive a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose.2
The preferred sites for intramuscular injections are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in toddlers and young children.
Persons 18 years of age and older should receive a single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.
