As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
CUTIVATE® Cream should not be used with occlusive dressings. CUTIVATE® Cream should not be applied in the diaper area, as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressings.
