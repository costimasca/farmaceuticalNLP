RYTHMOL SR can be taken with or without food. Do not crush or further divide the contents of the capsule.
The dose of RYTHMOL SR must be individually titrated on the basis of response and tolerance. Initiate therapy with RYTHMOL SR 225 mg given every 12 hours. Dosage may be increased at a minimum of 5 day interval to 325 mg given every 12 hours. If additional therapeutic effect is needed, the dose of RYTHMOL SR may be increased to 425 mg given every 12 hours.
In patients with hepatic impairment or those with significant widening of the QRS complex or second or third degree AV block, consider reducing the dose.
The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6   inhibition with the simultaneous administration of propafenone may significantly   increase the concentration of propafenone and thereby increase the risk of proarrhythmia   and other adverse events. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of RYTHMOL SR with   both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor, [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS   and DRUG INTERACTIONS].
