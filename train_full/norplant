The NORPLANT (levonorgestrel implants (unavailable in us))  SYSTEM consists of six SilasticÂ® capsules, each containing   36 mg of the progestin, levonorgestrel. The total administered (implanted) dose   is 216 mg. Implantation of all six capsules should be performed during the first   7 days of the onset of menses by a health-care professional instructed in the   NORPLANT (levonorgestrel implants (unavailable in us))  SYSTEM insertion technique. Insertion is subdermal in the midportion   of the upper arm about 8 to 10 cm above the elbow crease. Distribution should   be in a fanlike pattern, about 15 degrees apart, for a total of 75 degrees.   Proper insertion will facilitate later removal. (See section on Insertion/Removal.)
