AUGMENTIN XR should be taken at the start of a meal to enhance the absorption of amoxicillin and to minimize the potential for  gastrointestinal intolerance. AUGMENTIN XR is not recommended to be taken with a high-fat meal, because clavulanate absorption is decreased. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is 4,000 mg/250 mg daily according to the following table:
 
Tablets of AUGMENTIN (250 mg or 500 mg) CANNOT be used to provide the same dosages as AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets. This is because AUGMENTIN XR contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid, while the AUGMENTIN 250-mg and 500-mg tablets each contain 125 mg of clavulanic acid. In addition, the Extended Release Tablet provides an extended time course of plasma amoxicillin concentrations compared to immediate-release Tablets. Thus, two AUGMENTIN 500-mg tablets are not equivalent to one AUGMENTIN XR tablet.
Scored AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are available for adult patients who have difficulty swallowing. The scored tablet is not intended to reduce the dosage of medication taken; as stated in the table above, the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is two tablets twice a day (every 12 hours).
The pharmacokinetics of AUGMENTIN XR have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. AUGMENTIN XR is contraindicated in patients with a creatinine clearance of  <  30 mL/min and in hemodialysis patients [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].
Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic function monitored at regular intervals [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Pediatric patients who weigh 40 kg or more and can swallow tablets should receive the adult dose [see Use in Specific Populations].
No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly [see Use In Specific Populations].
