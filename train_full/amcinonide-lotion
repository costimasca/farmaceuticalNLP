Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin    film from two to three times daily depending on the severity of the condition.
The lotion may be applied topically to the specified lesions, particularly to those in hairy areas, two times per day.The lotion should be rubbed into the affected area completely, and the area should be protected from washing, clothing, rubbing, etc.until the lotion is dried. Occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions.
If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued    and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.
