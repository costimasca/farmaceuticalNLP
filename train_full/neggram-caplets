Antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum; sucralfate; divalent or   trivalent cations such as iron; multivitamins containing zinc; or Videx®   (Didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets of the pediatric powder for oral solution   should not be taken within the two-hour period before or within the two-hour   period after taking nalidixic acid.
The recommended dosage for initial therapy in adults is 1 g administered four   times daily for one or two weeks (total daily dose, 4 g). For prolonged therapy,   the total daily dose may be reduced to 2 g after the initial treatment period.   Underdosage during initial treatment may predispose to emergence of bacterial   resistance.
The normal dosage of nalidixic acid may be employed in patients with plasma   creatinine of less than 300 μmol/L (creatinine clearance more than 20 mL/minute).   Dosage should be halved in patients with plasma creatinine of more than 300   μmol/L (creatinine clearance 20 mL/minute or less).
Until further experience is gained, NegGram should not be administered to infants   younger than three months. Dosage in pediatric patients 12 years of age and   under should be calculated on the basis of body weight. The recommended total   daily dosage for initial therapy is 25 mg/lb/day (55 mg/kg/day), administered   in four equally divided doses. For prolonged therapy, the total daily dose may   be reduced to 15 mg/lb/day (33 mg/kg/day). NegGram Caplets of 250 mg may be   used.
