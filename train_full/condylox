The prescriber should ensure that the patient is fully aware of the correct method of therapy and identify which specific warts should be treated.
Apply twice daily for 3 consecutive days, then discontinue for 4 consecutive    days. This one week cycle of treatment may be repeated until there is no visible    wart tissue or for a maximum of four cycles. If there is incomplete response    after four treatment cycles, discontinue treatment and consider alternative    treatment. Safety and effectiveness of more than four treatment cycles has not    been established. There is no evidence to suggest that more frequent application    will increase efficacy, but additional applications would be expected to increase    the rate of local adverse reactions and systemic absorption.
Condylox Gel (podofilox gel)  0.5% should be applied to the warts with the applicator tip or    finger. Application on the surrounding normal tissue should be minimized. Treatment    should be limited to 10 cm2 or less of wart tissue and to no more    than 0.5 g of the gel per day.
Care should be taken to allow the gel to dry before allowing the return of opposing skin surfaces to their normal positions. Patients should be instructed to wash their hands thoroughly before and after each application.
