For intravenous infusion only.
Adenoscan should be given as a continuous peripheral intravenous infusion.
The recommended intravenous dose for adults is 140 mcg/kg/min infused for six minutes (total dose of 0.84 mg/kg).
The required dose of thallium-201 should be injected at the midpoint of the Adenoscan infusion (i.e., after the first three minutes of Adenoscan). Thallium-201 is physically compatible with Adenoscan and may be injected directly into the Adenoscan infusion set.
The injection should be as close to the venous access as possible to prevent an inadvertent increase in the dose of Adenoscan (the contents of the IV tubing) being administered.
There are no data on the safety or efficacy of alternative Adenoscan infusion protocols.
The safety and efficacy of Adenoscan administered by the intracoronary route have not been established.
The following Adenoscan infusion nomogram may be used to determine the appropriate infusion rate corrected for total body weight:
 
This nomogram was derived from the following general formula:
0.140 (mg/kg/min) x total body weight (kg)/ Adenoscan concentration (3mg / mL) = Infusion rate (mL/min)
Note: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
