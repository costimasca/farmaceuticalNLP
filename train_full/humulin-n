Inspect HUMULIN N visually before use. It should not contain particulate matter and should appear uniformly cloudy after mixing. Do not use HUMULIN N if particulate matter is seen.
HUMULIN N should only be administered subcutaneously. Administer in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall, thigh, upper arm, or buttocks. To reduce the risk of lipodystrophy, rotate the injection site within the same region from one injection to the next [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Do not administer HUMULIN N intravenously or intramuscularly and do not use HUMULIN N in an insulin infusion pump.
Individualize and adjust the dosage of HUMULIN N based on the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal.
Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and Use In Specific Populations].
Dosage adjustment may be needed when HUMULIN N is coadministered with certain drugs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
Dosage adjustment may be needed when switching from another insulin to HUMULIN N [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
HUMULIN N may be used with a prandial insulin if indicated. HUMULIN N may be mixed with HUMULIN R or HUMALOG before injection.
