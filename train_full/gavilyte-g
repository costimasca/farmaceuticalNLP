The recommended dose for adults is 4 liters of GaviLyte-G solution prior to gastrointestinal examination, as ingestion of this dose produces a satisfactory preparation in over 95% of patients. Ideally, the patients should fast for approximately three or four hours priorto GaviLyte-G administration, but in no case should solid food be given for at least two hours before the solution is given.
GaviLyte-G is usually administered orally, but may be given via nasogastric tube to patients who are unwilling or unable to drink the solution. Oral administration is at a rate of 240 mL (8oz.) every 10 minutes, until 4 liters are consumed or the rectal effluent is clear. Rapid drinking of each portion is preferred to drinking small amounts continuously. Nasogastric tube administration is at the rate of 20 to 30 mL per minute (1.2 to 1.8 liters per hour). The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of GaviLyte-G administration.
Various regimens have been used. One method is to schedule patients for examination in midmorning or later, allowing the patients three hours for drinking and an additional one hour period for complete bowel evacuation. Another method is to administer GaviLyte-G on the evening before the examination, particularly if the patient is to have a barium enema
GaviLyte-G is prepared by filing the container to the 4 liter mark with water and shaking vigorously several times to ensure that the ingredients are dissolved. Dissolution is facilitated by using lukewarm water. The solution is more palatable if chilled before admin istration. The reconstituted solution should be refrigerated and used within 48 hours. Discard any unused portion.
