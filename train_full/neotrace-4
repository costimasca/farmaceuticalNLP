The suggested dosage ranges for the four trace elements in neonates and pediatric patients are: 
Zinc: For full term infants and children up to 5 years of age, 100 mcg zinc/kg/day is recommended. For premature infants up to 3 kg in body weight, 300 mcg zinc/kg/day is suggested. 
Copper: For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage level is 20 mcg copper/kg/day. 
Manganese: For pediatric patients, a dosage of 2 to 10 mcg manganese/kg/day is suggested.
Chromium: For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage is 0.14 to 0.20 mcg/kg/day. 
Periodic monitoring of plasma levels of zinc, copper, manganese and chromium is suggested as a guideline preparation. 
Aseptic addition of Neotrace®-4 to the TPN solution under a laminar wflow hood is recommended. The trace elements present in Neotrace®-4 are physically compatible with the electrolytes and vitamins usually present in the amino acid/dextrose solution used for TPN. 
Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
