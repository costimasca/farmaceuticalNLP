Since thioridazine is associated with a dose-related prolongation of the QTc    interval, which is a potentially life-threatening event, its use should be reserved    for schizophrenic patients who fail to respond adequately to treatment with    other antipsychotic drugs. Dosage must be individualized and the smallest effective    dosage should be determined for each patient (see INDICATIONS and WARNINGS).
The usual starting dose for adult schizophrenic patients is 50 to 100 mg three times a day, with a gradual increment to a maximum of 800 mg daily if necessary. Once effective control of symptoms has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced gradually to determine the minimum maintenance dose. The total daily dosage ranges from 200 to 800 mg, divided into two to four doses.
For pediatric patients with schizophrenia who are unresponsive to other agents, the recommended initial dose is 0.5 mg/kg/day given in divided doses. Dosage may be increased gradually until optimum therapeutic effect is obtained or the maximum dose of 3 mg/kg/ day has been reached.
