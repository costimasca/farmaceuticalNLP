TRITEC (ranitidine bismuth citrate)  400 mg b.i.d plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d.
TRITEC (ranitidine bismuth citrate)  400 mg b.i.d.
 An alternative dosage regimen of TRITEC (ranitidine bismuth citrate)  400 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks (28 days) in conjunction with clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. for the first 2 weeks (14 days) has been shown to be equally effective. 
Dosage Adjustment in Elderly Patients: No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. (See PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use and clarithromycin package insert.) 
Dosage Adjustment in Renally Impaired Patients: Because the principal route of excretion is renal, care should be exercised when administering this combination therapy to renally impaired patients. This combination therapy is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 25 mL/min.
