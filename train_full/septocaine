Table 1 (below) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Septocaine® (articane hcl and epinephrine injection)    for various types of anesthetic procedures. The dosages suggested in this table   are for normal healthy adults, administered by submucosal infiltration or nerve    block.
Table 1: Recommended Dosages for Both Strengths 
The recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required   for most routine procedures. The actual volumes to be used depend on a number   of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia,   degree of muscular relaxation, and condition of the patient. In all cases, the   smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given.
The onset of anesthesia and the duration of anesthesia are proportional to   the volume and concentration (i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used. Caution   should be exercised when employing large volumes because the incidence of side   effects may be dose-related.
For most routine dental procedures, Septocaine® (articane hcl and epinephrine injection)  containing epinephrine    1:200,000 is preferred. However, when more pronounced hemostasis or improved   visualization of the surgical field are required, Septocaine® (articane hcl and epinephrine injection)  containing   epinephrine 1:100,000 may be used.
Dose reduction may be required in debilitated patients, acutely ill patients,    elderly patients, and pediatric patients commensurate with their age and physical     condition. No studies have been performed in patients with renal or liver dysfunction.    Caution should be used in patients with severe liver disease.
