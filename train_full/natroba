Shake bottle well. Apply sufficient NATROBA Topical Suspension to cover dry scalp, then apply to dry hair. Depending on hair length, apply up to 120 mL (one bottle) to adequately cover scalp and hair. Leave on for 10 minutes, then thoroughly rinse off NATROBA Topical Suspension with warm water. If live lice are seen 7 days after the first treatment, a second treatment should be applied. Avoid contact with eyes.
