Table 1: Dosing Formula for Surgical Patients and Pregnant Women 
AT activity monitoring is required for proper treatment. Check AT activity once or twice per day with dose adjustments made according to Table 2.
Table 2: AT Activity Monitoring and Dose Adjustment 
As surgery or delivery may rapidly decrease the AT activity levels, check the AT level just after surgery or delivery. If AT activity level is below 80%, an additional bolus dose may be administered to rapidly restore decreased AT activity level. In such instances, the loading dose formulae in Table 1 should be used, utilizing in the calculation the last available AT activity result. Thereafter, restart the maintenance dose at the same rate of infusion as before the bolus.
