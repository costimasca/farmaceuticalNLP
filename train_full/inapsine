Dosage should be individualized. Some of the factors to be considered    in determining the dose are age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological    condition, use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used and the surgical    procedure involved.
Vital signs and ECG should be monitored routinely.
Adult dosage: The maximum recommended initial dose of INAPSINE (droperidol)  is 2.5    mg IM or slow IV. Additional 1.25 mg doses of INAPSINE (droperidol)  may be administered to    achieve the desired effect. However, additional doses should be administered    with caution, and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.
Children's dosage: For children two to 12 years of age, the maximum    recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg, taking into account the patient's age    and other clinical factors. However, additional doses should be administered    with caution, and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.
See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for use of INAPSINE (droperidol)  with other CNS    depressants and in patients with altered response.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If such abnormalities are observed, the drug should not be administered.
