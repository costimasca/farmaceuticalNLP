Sodium Acetate (sodium acetate (sodium acetate (sodium acetate injection)  injection)  injection)  Injection, USP 40 mEq is administered intravenously only after    dilution in a larger volume of fluid. The dose and rate of administration are    dependent upon the individual needs of the patient. Serum sodium should be monitored    as a guide to dosage. Using aseptic technique, all or part of the contents of    one or more vials may be added to other intravenous fluids to provide any desired    number of milliequivalents (mEq) of sodium (Na+) with an equal number    of acetate (CH3COO-).
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration. See PRECAUTIONS.
