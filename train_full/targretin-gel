Targretin® gel should be initially applied once every other day for the   first week. The application frequency should be increased at weekly intervals   to once daily, then twice daily, then three times daily and finally four times   daily according to individual lesion tolerance. Generally, patients were able   to maintain a dosing frequency of two to four times per day. Most responses   were seen at dosing frequencies of two times per day and higher. If application   site toxicity occurs, the application frequency can be reduced. Should severe   irritation occur, application of drug can be temporarily discontinued for a   few days until the symptoms subside. See CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy:   Category X.
Sufficient gel should be applied to cover the lesion with a generous coating.   The gel should be allowed to dry before covering with clothing. Because unaffected   skin may become irritated, application of the gel to normal skin surrounding   the lesions should be avoided. In addition, do not apply the gel near mucosal   surfaces of the body.
A response may be seen as soon as four weeks after initiation of therapy but   most patients require longer application. With continued application, further   benefit may be attained. The longest onset time for the first response among   the responders was 392 days based on the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion   Severity in the multicenter study. In clinical trials, Targretin® gel was   applied for up to 172 weeks.
Targretin® gel should be continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit.
Occlusive dressings should not be used with Targretin® gel.
