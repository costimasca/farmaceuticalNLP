Methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide tablet 5 mg)  tablet 5 mg)  tablet 5 mg)  is administered orally. Therapy should be individualized according to patient response. This therapy should be titrated to gain maximal therapeutic response as well as the minimal dose possible to maintain that therapeutic response.
The usual adult dose ranges from 2.5 mg to 10 mg once daily. Maximum effective single dose is 10 mg; larger single doses do not accomplish greater diuresis, and are not recommended.
The usual adult dose ranges from 2.5 to 5 mg once daily.
If control of blood pressure is not satisfactory after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy with 5 mg once daily, another antihypertensive drug should be added. Increasing the dosage of methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide tablet 5 mg)  tablet 5 mg)  tablet 5 mg)  will usually not result in further lowering of blood pressure.
Methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide tablet 5 mg)  tablet 5 mg)  tablet 5 mg)  may be either employed alone for mild to moderate hypertension or concurrently with other antihypertensive drugs in the management of more severe forms of hypertension. Combined therapy may provide adequate control of hypertension with lower dosage of the component drugs and fewer or less severe side effects.
When other antihypertensive agents are to be added to the  regimen, this should be accomplished gradually. Ganglionic blocking agents should be given at only half the usual dose since their effect is potentiated by pretreatment with methyclothiazide tablets.
