The usual dietary potassium intake by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses of 40-100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose. The dose should be taken after a meal.
K-LOR (potassium chloride)  20 mEq powder provides 20 mEq of potassium chloride.
Each 20 mEq (one K-LOR (potassium chloride)  20 mEq packet) of potassium should be dissolved in at    least 4 oz (approximately 1/2 glassful) cold water or juice. This preparation,    like other potassium supplements, must be properly diluted to avoid the possibility    of gastrointestinal irritation.
