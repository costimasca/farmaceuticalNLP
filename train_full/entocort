The recommended dosage of ENTOCORT EC is:
9 mg orally once daily for up to 8 weeks. Repeated 8 week courses of ENTOCORT EC can be given for recurring episodes of active disease.
9 mg orally once daily for up to 8 weeks, followed by 6 mg once daily for 2 weeks.
The recommended dosage in adults, following an 8 week course(s) of treatment for active disease and once the patient’s symptoms are controlled (CDAI less than 150), is ENTOCORT EC 6 mg orally once daily for maintenance of clinical remission up to 3 months. If symptom control is still maintained at 3 months an attempt to taper to complete cessation is recommended. Continued treatment with ENTOCORT EC 6 mg for more than 3 months has not been shown to provide substantial clinical benefit.
Patients with mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon have been switched from oral prednisolone to ENTOCORT EC with no reported episodes of adrenal insufficiency. Since prednisolone should not be stopped abruptly, tapering should begin concomitantly with initiating ENTOCORT EC treatment.
Consider reducing the dosage of ENTOCORT EC to 3 mg once daily for adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations].
