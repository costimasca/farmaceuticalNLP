Use the lowest effective dose for the patient.
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg. Dosing can be raised to 2 mg or 3 mg if clinically indicated. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels of LUNESTA following use of the 2 mg or 3 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. The total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 3 mg, once daily immediately before bedtime [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg in elderly or debilitated patients.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, or in patients coadministered LUNESTA with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, the total dose of LUNESTA should not exceed 2 mg [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Dosage adjustments may be necessary when LUNESTA is combined with other CNS depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Taking LUNESTA with or immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would be expected to reduce the effect of LUNESTA on sleep latency [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
