The dosage of Ferrlecit is expressed in terms of mg of elemental iron. Each 5 mL sterile, single-use vial contains 62.5 mg of elemental iron (12.5 mg/mL).
Do not mix Ferrlecit with other medications, or add to  parenteral nutrition solutions for intravenous infusion. The compatibility of Ferrlecit with intravenous infusion vehicles other than 0.9% sodium chloride has not been evaluated. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration, whenever the solution and container permit. If diluted, use immediately.
Ferrlecit treatment may be repeated if iron deficiency reoccurs.
The recommended dosage of Ferrlecit for the repletion treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is 10 mL of Ferrlecit (125 mg of elemental iron). Ferrlecit may be diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour per dialysis session. Ferrlecit may also be administered undiluted as a slow intravenous injection (at a rate of up to 12.5 mg/min) per dialysis session. For repletion treatment most patients may require a cumulative dose of 1000 mg of elemental iron administered over 8 dialysis sessions. Ferrlecit has been administered at sequential dialysis sessions by infusion or by slow intravenous injection during the dialysis session itself.
Data from Ferrlecit postmarketing spontaneous reports indicate that individual doses exceeding 125 mg may be associated with a higher incidence and/or severity of adverse events [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
The recommended pediatric dosage of Ferrlecit for the repletion treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is 0.12 mL/kg Ferrlecit (1.5 mg/kg of elemental iron) diluted in 25 mL 0.9% sodium chloride and administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour per dialysis session. The maximum dosage should not exceed 125 mg per dose.
