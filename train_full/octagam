For intravenously use only
As there are significant differences in the half-life of  IgG among patients with primary humoral immunodeficiencies, the frequency and amount of immunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient. The proper amount can be determined by monitoring clinical response.
The dose of Octagam 5% liquid for replacement therapy in primary humoral immunodeficiency diseases is 300 to 600 mg/kg body weight (6-12 ml/kg) administered every 3 to 4 weeks. The dosage may be adjusted over time to achieve the desired trough levels and clinical responses.
If a patient is at risk of measles exposure (ie., outbreak in US or travel to endemic areas outside of the US) and receives a dose of less than 400 mg/kg every 3 to 4 weeks, the dose should be increased to at least 400 mg/kg. If a patient has been exposed to measles, this dose should be administered as soon as possible after exposure.
If a patient on regular treatment missed a dose, the missed dose should be administered as soon as possible, and then treatment should continue as before.
Octagam 5% liquid should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if turbid and/or discoloration is observed.
Octagam 5% liquid should be at room temperature during administration. Only administer intravenously.
Any bottle that has been opened should be used promptly. Partially used bottles should be discarded.
Octagam 5% liquid is not supplied with an infusion set. If an in-line filter is used the pore size should be 0.2 – 200 microns.
Do not use a needle of larger than 16 gauge to prevent the possibility of coring. Insert needle only once, within the stopper area delineated (by the raised ring for penetration). The stopper should be penetrated perpendicular to the plane of the stopper within the ring.
It is recommended that Octagam 5% liquid be initially infused at infusion rates stated below, at least until the physician has had adequate experience with a given patient.
Infusion rates: 0.5 mg/kg/min (30 mg/kg/hr for the first 30 minutes; if tolerated, advance to 1 mg/kg/min (60 mg/kg/hr) for the second 30 minutes; and if further tolerated, advance to 2 mg/kg/min (120 mg/kg/hr) for the third 30 minutes. Thereafter the infusion can be maintained at a rate up to, but not exceeding, 3.33 mg/kg/min (200 mg/kg/hr).
For patients judged to be at risk for developing renal dysfunction, administer Octagam 5% liquid at the minimum infusion rate practicable, not to exceed 0.07 ml/kg (3.3 mg/kg)/minute (200 mg/kg/hour).
Table 1 
Certain severe adverse drug reactions may be related to the rate of infusion. Slowing or stopping the infusion usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly.
Ensure that patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency are not volume depleted; discontinue Octagam 5% liquid if renal function deteriorates.
For patients at risk of renal dysfunction or thromboembolic events, administer Octagam 5% liquid at the minimum infusion rate practicable.
Octagam 5% liquid must not be mixed with other medicinal products or administered simultaneously with other intravenous preparations in the same infusion set.
Octagam 5% liquid may be stored for 24 months at +2°C to + 25°C (36°F to 77°F) from the date of manufacture.
Do not freeze. Frozen product should not be used.
Do not use after expiration date.
