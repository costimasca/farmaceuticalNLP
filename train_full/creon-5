Clinical experience should dictate initial starting dose. Doses should be taken during meals or snacks, not before or after. Do not take without food.
Usual initial starting dosage is two to four CREON 5 (pancrelipase delayed-release minimicrospheres)  Capsules per meal or snack.
The exact dosage of CREON 5 (pancrelipase delayed-release minimicrospheres)  Capsules should be selected based on clinical experience for this age group. Patients can be started on one to two capsules per meal or snack.
For cystic fibrosis patients, typical doses are 1,500 - 3,000 USP lipase units/kg/meal. Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the disease, control of steatorrhea and maintenance of good nutritional status. Doses in excess of 6,000 USP lipase units/kg/meal are not recommended.
Dose increases, if required, should occur with careful monitoring of body weight and stool fat content. When changing strengths of pancreatic enzyme products, care should be taken to maintain equivalent lipase units for each divided dosage.
It is important to ensure adequate hydration of patients at all times while taking pancreatic enzymes.
Where swallowing of capsules is difficult, the capsules may be carefully opened and the MINIMICROSPHERES added to a small amount of soft food, with a pH less than 5.5. The soft food should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with a glass of water or juice to insure swallowing.
