Initiate dosing at 0.01 to 0.3 mcg/kg/min as a continuous intravenous infusion. Dosing may be increased in increments of 0.05 to 0.1 mcg/kg/minute every 15 minutes or longer, until target blood pressure is reached [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]; the maximal infusion rate reported in clinical studies was 1.6 mcg/kg/minute. Doses lower than 0.1 mcg/kg/min and slow up-titration have been associated with less reflex tachycardia. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours.
Oral antihypertensive agents can be added during fenoldopam infusion or after discontinuation.
Initiate dosing at 0.2 mcg/kg/minute and titrate dose by 0.3 to 0.5 mcg/kg/min every 20-30 minutes to a maximum dose of 0.8 mcg/kg/minute. Higher doses generally produced no further decreases in MAP but did worsen tachycardia.
Dilute contents of ampules or vials with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose in Water before infusion. Each ampule or vial is for single use only. Discard diluted solution if not being administered to a patient after 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at refrigerated temperature. Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If particulate matter or cloudiness is observed, discard the drug.

Rates of infusion in mL/hour for fenoldopam may be calculated using the following formula:

Infusion Rate (mL/h) =
Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows:
Example 1: for a 60 kg patient at an initial dose of 0.01 mcg/kg/min using a 40 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Example 2: for a 10 kg patient at a dose of 0.2   mcg/kg/min using a 60 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as   follows:
