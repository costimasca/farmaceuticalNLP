Shake the syringe vigorously before administering the vaccine and shake the multidose vial preparation each time before withdrawing a dose of vaccine.
Inspect FLUVIRIN® syringes and multidose vials visually for particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to administration [see DESCRIPTION]. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.
Between uses, return the multidose vial to the recommended storage conditions between 2° and 8°C (36° and 46°F). Do not freeze. Discard if the vaccine has been frozen.
A separate sterile syringe and needle must be used for each injection to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one person to another. Needles should be disposed of properly and not recapped.
It is recommended that small syringes (0.5 mL or 1 mL) should be used to minimize any product loss.
For intramuscular use only.
The dose and schedule for Fluvirin is presented in Table 1.
TABLE 1 : Fluvirin Dose and Schedule 
In children, the needle size may range from 7/8 to 1¼ inches, depending on the size of the child's deltoid muscle, and should be of sufficient length to penetrate the muscle tissue. The anterolateral thigh can be used, but the needle should be longer, usually 1 inch.
In adults, a needle of  ≥ 1 inch is preferred because needles  < 1 inch might be of insufficient length to penetrate muscle tissue in certain adults. The preferred site for intramuscular injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The vaccine should not be injected in the gluteal  region or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk.
