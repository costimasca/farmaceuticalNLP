With the patient in recumbent or seated position a capsule of amyl nitrite (amyl nitrite inhalant)     is held away from the face, crushed between the fingers, and held under the    patient's nose. Two to six inhalations of the vapors from the capsule are usually    sufficient to promptly produce therapeutic effects. Caution is recommended to    avoid inhalation of excessive amounts of the drug when it is administered by    someone other than the patient. If necessary, the dose may be repeated in 3    to 5 minutes.
