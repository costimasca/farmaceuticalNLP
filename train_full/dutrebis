DUTREBIS is a fixed-dose combination product containing 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of raltegravir. The recommended dosage of DUTREBIS in adults, adolescents (16 years of age and older), and pediatric patients (6 through 16 years of age and weighing at least 30 kg) is one tablet taken twice daily orally with or without food.
Administer DUTREBIS in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The maximum dose of DUTREBIS is one tablet (150 mg lamivudine/300 mg raltegravir) taken twice daily.
DUTREBIS is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of  < 50 mL/min. If creatinine clearance decreases to  < 50 mL/min, DUTREBIS should be switched to the individual components (lamivudine and raltegravir) to allow for lamivudine dose reduction. Please refer to the full prescribing information for lamivudine and raltegravir for dosing instructions.
