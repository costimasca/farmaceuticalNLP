Use the lowest dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of VIMOVO and other treatment options before deciding to use VIMOVO. VIMOVO does not allow for administration of a lower daily dose of esomeprazole. If a dose of esomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more appropriate, a different treatment should be considered.
The dosage is one tablet twice daily of VIMOVO 375 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole or 500 mg naproxen and 20 mg of esomeprazole.
The tablets are to be swallowed whole with liquid. Do not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet. VIMOVO is to be taken at least 30 minutes before meals.
Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  < 30 mL/min) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use In Specific Populations].
Monitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely and consider a possible dose reduction based on the naproxen component of VIMOVO.
VIMOVO should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations].
The safety and efficacy of VIMOVO in children younger than 18 years has not been established. VIMOVO is therefore not recommended for use in children.
