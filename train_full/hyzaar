The usual starting dose of HYZAAR is 50/12.5 (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. The dosage can be increased after 3 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 100/25 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies]. 
Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 50 mg monotherapy with HYZAAR 50/12.5 once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to two tablets of HYZAAR 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of HYZAAR 100/25 once daily.
Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 100 mg monotherapy with HYZAAR 100/12.5 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of HYZAAR 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of HYZAAR 100/25 once daily.
Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on HYZAAR 50/12.5 once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. Evaluate the clinical response to HYZAAR 50/12.5 and, if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of HYZAAR 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of HYZAAR 100/25 once daily.
In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on 50 mg losartan potassium, initiate treatment with HYZAAR 50/12.5. If additional blood pressure reduction is needed, increase the dose to HYZAAR 100/12.5, followed by HYZAAR 100/25. For further blood pressure reduction add other antihypertensives [see Clinical Studies].
