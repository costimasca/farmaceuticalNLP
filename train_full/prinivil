Initial therapy in adults: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose. Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give a greater effect.
If blood pressure is not controlled with PRINIVIL alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg).
The recommended starting dose in adult patients with hypertension taking diuretics is 5 mg once per day [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
For pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate  > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², the recommended starting dose is 0.07 mg/kg once daily (up to 5 mg total). Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response up to a maximum of 0.61 mg/kg (up to 40 mg) once daily. Doses above 0.61 mg/kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
PRINIVIL is not recommended in pediatric patients  < 6 years or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate  < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [see Use in Specific Populations and Clinical Studies].
The recommended starting dose for PRINIVIL, when used with diuretics and (usually) digitalis as adjunctive therapy is 5 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose in these patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium  < 130 mEq/L) is 2.5 mg once daily. Increase as tolerated to a maximum of 40 mg once daily.
Diuretic dose may need to be adjusted to help minimize hypovolemia, which may contribute to hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS]. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of PRINIVIL does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.
In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, give PRINIVIL 5 mg orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg once daily. Dosing should continue for at least 6 weeks.
Initiate therapy with 2.5 mg in patients with a low systolic blood pressure (100-120 mmHg) during the first 3 days after the infarct [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. If hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure  ≤ 100 mmHg) consider doses of 2.5 or 5 mg. If prolonged hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure  < 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) discontinue PRINIVIL.
No dose adjustment of PRINIVIL is required in patients with creatinine clearance  > 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 10-30 mL/min, reduce the initial dose of PRINIVIL to half of the usual recommended dose (i.e., hypertension, 5 mg; heart failure or acute MI, 2.5 mg). For patients on hemodialysis or creatinine clearance  < 10 mL/min, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
