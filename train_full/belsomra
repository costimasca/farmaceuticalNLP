Use the lowest dose effective for the patient.
The recommended dose for BELSOMRA is 10 mg, taken no more than once per night and within 30 minutes of going to bed, with at least 7 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective, the dose can be increased. The maximum recommended dose of BELSOMRA is 20 mg once daily.
Exposure to BELSOMRA is increased in obese compared to non-obese patients, and in women compared to men. Particularly in obese women, the increased risk of exposure-related adverse effects should be considered before increasing the dose [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
When BELSOMRA is combined with other CNS depressant drugs, dosage adjustment of BELSOMRA and/or the other drug(s) may be necessary because of potentially additive effects [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended dose of BELSOMRA is 5 mg when used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors and the dose generally should not exceed 10 mg in these patients. BELSOMRA is not recommended for use with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
Time to effect of BELSOMRA may be delayed if taken with or soon after a meal.
