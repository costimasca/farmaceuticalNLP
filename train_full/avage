Application may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive   individuals. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue   therapy, or the dosing has been reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate,   therapy can be resumed, or the frequency of application can be increased as   the patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application   should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic   response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than   once daily dosing frequencies.
Apply a pea-sized amount once a day at bedtime to lightly cover the entire   face including the eyelids if desired. Facial moisturizers may be used as frequently   as desired. If any makeup is present it should be removed before applying AVAGE®   (TAZAROTENE) Cream 0.1% to the face. If the face is washed or a bath or shower   is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the cream.   If emollients or moisturizers are used, they can be applied either before or   after application of tazarotene cream ensuring that the first cream or lotion   has absorbed into the skin and has dried completely. Frequency of application   should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic   response and skin tolerance. If the frequency of dosing is reduced, it should   be noted that efficacy at a reduced frequency of application has not been established.   The duration of the mitigating effects on facial fine wrinkling, mottled hypo-   and hyperpigmentation, and benign facial lentigines following discontinuation   of AVAGE® (TAZAROTENE) Cream 0.1% has not been studied.
