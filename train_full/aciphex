Table 1 shows the recommended dosage of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets in adults and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older. The use of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 1 year to less than 12 years of age because the lowest available tablet strength (20 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients. Use another rabeprazole formulation for pediatric patients 1 year to less than 12 years of age.
