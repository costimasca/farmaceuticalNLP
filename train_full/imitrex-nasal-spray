In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg of IMITREX Nasal    Spray administered into 1 nostril were effective for the acute treatment of    migraine in adults. A greater proportion of patients had headache response following    a 20-mg dose than following a 5- or 10-mg dose (see Clinical    Trials). Individuals may vary in response to doses of IMITREX Nasal    Spray. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing    the possible benefit of the 20-mg dose with the potential for a greater risk    of adverse events. A 10-mg dose may be achieved by the administration of a single    5-mg dose in each nostril. There is evidence that doses above 20 mg do not provide    a greater effect than 20 mg.
If the headache returns, the dose may be repeated once after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 40 mg. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.
