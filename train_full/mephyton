MEPHYTON (phytonadione)  Summary of Dosage Guidelines (See circular    text for details) 
To correct excessively prolonged prothrombin times caused by oral anticoagulant    therapy â€“ 2.5 to 10 mg or up to 25 mg initially is recommended. In rare instances    50 mg may be required. Frequency and amount of subsequent doses should be determined    by prothrombin time response or clinical condition. (See WARNINGS.)    If, in 12 to 48 hours after oral administration, the prothrombin time has not    been shortened satisfactorily, the dose should be repeated.
If possible, discontinuation or reduction of the dosage of drugs interfering    with coagulation mechanisms (such as salicylates, antibiotics) is suggested    as an alternative to administering concurrent MEPHYTON (phytonadione) . The severity of the    coagulation disorder should determine whether the immediate administration of    MEPHYTON (phytonadione)  is required in addition to discontinuation or reduction of interfering    drugs.
A dosage of 2.5 to 25 mg or more (rarely up to 50 mg) is recommended, the amount    and route of administration depending upon the severity of the condition and    response obtained.
The oral route should be avoided when the clinical disorder would prevent proper    absorption. Bile salts must be given with the tablets when the endogenous supply    of bile to the gastrointestinal tract is deficient.
