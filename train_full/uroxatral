The recommended dosage is one 10 mg UROXATRAL (alfuzosin HCl) extended-release tablet once daily. The extent of absorption of alfuzosin is 50% lower under fasting conditions. Therefore, Uroxatral should be taken with food and with the same meal each day. The tablets should not be chewed or crushed.
