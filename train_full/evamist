Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
Evamist therapy should be initiated with one spray per day. Dosage adjustment should be guided by the clinical response.
Before applying the first dose from a new applicator, the pump should be primed by spraying 3 sprays with the cover on. The container should be held upright and vertical for spraying.
One, two or three sprays are applied each morning to  adjacent, non-overlapping areas on the inner surface of the forearm, starting near the elbow. Sprays should be allowed to dry for approximately 2 minutes before covering the site with clothing. The site should not be washed for at least one hour. Application of Evamist to other skin surfaces has not been adequately studied. Evamist should not be applied to skin surfaces other than the forearm.
Strict adherence to the following precautions is advised in order to minimize the potential for secondary exposure to estradiol from Evamist-treated skin. Women should cover the Evamist application site with clothing if another person may come into contact with that area of skin after the spray dries. Additional precautions to minimize unintentional secondary exposure are outlined in Patient Counseling Information [see PATIENT INFORMATION and in the Patient Information Leaflet at the end of the prescribing information.
