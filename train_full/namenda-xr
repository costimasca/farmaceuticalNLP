The dosage of NAMENDA XR shown to be effective in a controlled clinical trial is 28 mg once daily.
The recommended starting dose of NAMENDA XR is 7 mg once daily. The dose should be increased in 7 mg increments to the recommended maintenance dose of 28 mg once daily. The minimum recommended interval between dose increases is one week. The dose should only be increased if the previous dose has been well tolerated. The maximum recommended dose is 28 mg once daily.
NAMENDA XR can be taken with or without food. NAMENDA XR capsules can be taken intact or may be opened, sprinkled on applesauce, and thereby swallowed. The entire contents of each NAMENDA XR capsule should be consumed; the dose should not be divided.
Except when opened and sprinkled on applesauce, as described above, NAMENDA XR should be swallowed whole. NAMENDA XR capsules should not be divided, chewed, or crushed.
If a patient misses a single dose of NAMENDA XR, that patient should not double up on the next dose. The next dose should be taken as scheduled. If a patient fails to take NAMENDA XR for several days, dosing may need to be resumed at lower doses and retitrated as described above.
Patients treated with NAMENDA may be switched to NAMENDA XR capsules as follows:
It is recommended that a patient who is on a regimen of 10 mg twice daily of NAMENDA be switched to NAMENDA XR 28 mg once daily capsules the day following the last dose of 10 mg NAMENDA. There is no study addressing the comparative efficacy of these 2 regimens.
In a patient with severe renal impairment, it is recommended that a patient who is on a regimen of 5 mg twice daily of NAMENDA be switched to NAMENDA XR 14 mg once daily capsules the day following the last dose of 5 mg NAMENDA.
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 5 â€“ 29 mL/min, based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation), the recommended maintenance dose (and maximum recommended dose) is 14 mg/day [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
