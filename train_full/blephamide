A small amount, approximately 1/2 inch ribbon of ointment, should be applied in the conjunctival sac three or four times daily and once or twice at night.
Not more than 8 g should be prescribed initially.
The dosing of BLEPHAMIDEÂ® ophthalmic ointment may be reduced, but care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely. In chronic conditions, withdrawal of treatment should be carried out by gradually decreasing the frequency of application.
If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated (see PRECAUTIONS).
