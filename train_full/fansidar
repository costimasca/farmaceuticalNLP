The dosage should be swallowed whole, and not chewed, with plenty of fluids    after a meal.
Treatment of Acute Malaria 
  
The malaria risk must be carefully weighed against the risk of serious adverse    drug reactions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). If Fansidar (sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine)  is prescribed    for prophylaxis, it is important that the physician inquires about sulfonamide    intolerance and points out the risk and the need for immediate drug withdrawal    if skin reactions do occur.
The first dose of Fansidar (sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine)  should be taken 1 or 2 days before arrival in an    endemic area; administration should be continued during the stay and for 4 to    6 weeks after return.
  
Prophylaxis with Fansidar (sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine)  should not be continued for more than two years,    since no experience of more prolonged administration is available to date.
