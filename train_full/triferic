Inspect Triferic ampules for signs of precipitation prior to mixing with the bicarbonate concentrate. Triferic ampules appear slightly yellow-green in color.
Triferic should only be added to the bicarbonate concentrate and should NOT be added to acid concentrate mixtures.
Triferic 50 mL ampule can be added to each 25 gallons (94.6 L) of master bicarbonate mix at each center at a ratio of one (1) 50 mL ampule for each 25 gallons of bicarbonate concentrate.
Administer Triferic to patients at each dialysis  procedure for as long as patients are receiving maintenance hemodialysis therapy for CKD.
The dosage of TrifericÂ® is expressed as mg of iron (III). Each mL of Triferic contains 5.44 mg of iron as iron (III).
Hemodialysis solutions should be used within 24 hours of the preparation of the Triferic/bicarbonate concentrate mixture.
