The recommended starting dosage of XADAGO is 50 mg administered orally once daily (at the same time of day), without regard to meals. After two weeks, the dosage may be increased to 100 mg once daily, based on individual need and tolerability.
Daily dosages of XADAGO above 100 mg have not been shown to provide additional benefit, and higher dosages increase the risk for adverse reactions. XADAGO has been shown to be effective only in combination with levodopa/carbidopa [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE].
If a dose is missed, the next dose should be taken at the same time the next day.
XADAGO 100 mg should be tapered by decreasing the dose to 50 mg for one week before stopping [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B: 7-9), the maximum recommended dosage of XADAGO is 50 mg orally once daily. XADAGO is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C: 10-15) [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. If a patient taking 50 mg XADAGO progresses from moderate to severe hepatic impairment, discontinue XADAGO.
