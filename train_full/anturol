The recommended dosage is three pumps of ANTUROL (84 mg/day) applied once daily   to clean, dry, intact skin on the abdomen, or upper arms/shoulders, or thighs.   Apply immediately after actuating the dose. Application sites may be rotated   to reduce the potential for local site reactions [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].   ANTUROL is for topical application only and should not be ingested. Wash hands   immediately after product application. Patients should cover the application   site with clothing after the gel has dried if direct skin-to-skin contact at   the application site is anticipated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
