The recommended starting dose of VOTRIENT is 800 mg orally once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. The dose of VOTRIENT should not exceed 800 mg.
Do not crush tablets due to the potential for increased rate of absorption which may affect systemic exposure [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If a dose is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours until the next dose.
In RCC, the initial dose reduction should be 400 mg, and additional dose decrease or increase should be in 200-mg steps based on individual tolerability.
In STS, a decrease or increase should be in 200-mg steps based on individual tolerability.
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, alternatives to VOTRIENT should be considered. If VOTRIENT is used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the dose should be reduced to 200 mg per day. VOTRIENT is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) increases pazopanib concentrations and should be avoided. Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted, reduce the dose of VOTRIENT to 400 mg. Further dose reductions may be needed if adverse effects occur during therapy [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pazopanib concentrations and should be avoided. Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. VOTRIENT should not be used in patients who cannot avoid chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
