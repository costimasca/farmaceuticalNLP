Mestinon (pyridostigmine)  is available in three dosage forms:
Syrup - raspberry-flavored, containing 60 mg pyridostigmine bromide    per teaspoonful (5 mL). This form permits accurate dosage adjustment for children    and "brittle" myasthenic patients who require fractions of 60 mg doses.    It is more easily swallowed, especially in the morning, by patients with bulbar    involvement.
Conventional Tablets - each containing 60 mg pyridostigmine bromide.
Timespan Tablets - each containing 180 mg pyridostigmine bromide.    This form provides uniformly slow release, hence prolonged duration of drug    action; it facilitates control of myasthenic symptoms with fewer individual    doses daily. The immediate effect of a 180 mg Timespan Tablet is about equal    to that of a 60 mg Conventional Tablet; however, its duration of effectiveness,    although varying in individual patients, averages 2½ times that of a 60 mg dose.
Dosage: The size and frequency of the dosage must be adjusted    to the needs of the individual patient.
Syrup and Conventional Tablets - The average dose is ten 60 mg    tablets or ten 5 mL teaspoonfuls daily, spaced to provide maximum relief when    maximum strength is needed. In severe cases as many as 25 tablets or teaspoonfuls    a day may be required, while in mild cases one to six tablets or teaspoonfuls    a day may suffice.
Timespan Tablets - One to three 180 mg tablets, once or twice    daily, will usually be sufficient to control symptoms; however, the needs of    certain individuals may vary markedly from this average. The interval between    doses should be at least 6 hours. For optimum control, it may be necessary to    use the more rapidly acting regular tablets or syrup in conjunction with Timespan    therapy.
Note: For information on a diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis, and    for the evaluation and stabilization of therapy, please see product literature    on Tensilon® (edrophonium chloride).
