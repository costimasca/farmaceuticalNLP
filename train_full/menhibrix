MENHIBRIX is to be reconstituted only with the accompanying saline diluent. The reconstituted vaccine should be a clear and colorless solution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.
