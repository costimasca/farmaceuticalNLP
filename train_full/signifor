The recommended dosage range of SIGNIFOR is 0.3 to 0.9 mg by subcutaneous injection twice a day. The recommended initial dose is either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg twice a day. Titrate dose based on response and tolerability.
Patients should be evaluated for a treatment response [clinically meaningful reduction in 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels and/or improvement in signs or symptoms of the disease] and should continue receiving therapy with SIGNIFOR as long as benefit is derived [see Clinical Studies]. Maximum urinary free cortisol reduction is typically seen by two months of treatment [see Clinical Studies]. For patients who are started on 0.6 mg twice a day, a dosage increase to 0.9 mg twice a day may be considered based on the response to the treatment, as long as the 0.6 mg dosage is well tolerated by the patient.
Management of suspected adverse reactions may require temporary dose reduction of SIGNIFOR. Dose reduction by 0.3 mg decrements per injection is suggested.
Prior to the start of SIGNIFOR, patients should have baseline levels of the following:
Patients should also have a baseline electrocardiogram and gallbladder ultrasound [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Treatment of patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus should be intensively optimized with anti-diabetic therapy prior to starting SIGNIFOR [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), the recommended initial dosage is 0.3 mg twice a day and the maximum dosage is 0.6 mg twice a day. Avoid the use of SIGNIFOR in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) [see Use in Specific Populations].
