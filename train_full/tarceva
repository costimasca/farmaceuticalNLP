Select patients for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with TARCEVA based on the presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in tumor or plasma specimens [See  Clinical Studies]. If these mutations are not detected in a plasma specimen, test tumor tissue if available. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of EGFR mutations in NSCLC is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.
The recommended daily dose of TARCEVA for NSCLC is 150 mg taken on an empty stomach, i.e., at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food. Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
The recommended daily dose of TARCEVA for pancreatic cancer is 100 mg taken once daily in combination with gemcitabine. Take TARCEVA on an empty stomach, i.e., at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food. Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs [see  Clinical Studies].
