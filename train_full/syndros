Starting Dosage
The recommended adult starting dosage of SYNDROS is 2.1 mg orally twice daily, one hour before lunch and one hour before dinner. 
In elderly patients, consider initiating SYNDROS at 2.1 mg once daily one hour before dinner or at bedtime to reduce the risk of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations].
Dosing later in the day may reduce the frequency of Central Nervous System (CNS) adverse reactions. CNS adverse reactions are dose-related [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]; therefore monitor patients and reduce the dosage as needed. If CNS adverse reactions of feeling high, dizziness, confusion, and somnolence occur, they usually resolve in 1 to 3 days and usually do not require dosage reduction. If CNS adverse reactions are severe or persistent, reduce the dose to 2.1 mg once daily one hour before dinner or in the evening at bedtime.
Dosage Titration
Starting Dosage
The recommended starting dosage of SYNDROS is 4.2 mg/m²orally administered 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for a total of 4 to 6 doses per day.
In elderly patients, consider initiating SYNDROS at 2.1 mg/m² once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations].
Because food delays the absorption of SYNDROS, administer the first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. Subsequent doses can be taken without regard to meals.
Because food can substantially change the systemic exposure to dronabinol and its active metabolite, the timing of dosing in relation to meal times should be kept consistent for each chemotherapy cycle, once the dosage has been determined from the titration process.
Dosage Titration
Monitor patients for adverse reactions and consider decreasing the dose to 2.1 mg once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS adverse reactions.
