Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ZORVOLEX and other treatment options before deciding to use ZORVOLEX. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The effectiveness of ZORVOLEX when taken with food has not been studied in clinical studies. Taking ZORVOLEX with food may cause a reduction in effectiveness compared to taking ZORVOLEX on an empty stomach [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
For management of mild to moderate acute pain, the dosage is 18 mg or 35 mg orally three times daily.
For management of osteoarthritis pain, the dosage is 35 mg orally three times daily.
Patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of ZORVOLEX compared to patients with normal hepatic function [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. As with other diclofenac products, start treatment at the lowest dose. If efficacy is not achieved with the lowest dose, discontinue use.
ZORVOLEX capsules are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral diclofenac even if the milligram strength is the same. ZORVOLEX capsules contain diclofenac free acid whereas other diclofenac products contain a salt of diclofenac, i.e., diclofenac potassium or sodium. A 35 mg dose of ZORVOLEX is approximately equal to 37.6 mg of sodium diclofenac or 39.5 mg of potassium diclofenac. Therefore, do not substitute similar dosing strengths of other diclofenac products without taking this into consideration.
