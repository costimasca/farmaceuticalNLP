Shielding should be utilized when preparing Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid    Injection.
In average ADULT (70 kg) patients: The suggested dose range used for liver/spleen    images is 37 to 296 megabecquerels (1 to 8 millicuries) and for bone marrow    images is 111 to 444 megabecquerels (3 to 12 millicuries) of Technetium Tc 99m    Sulfur Colloid Injection.
In PEDIATRIC patients: The suggested intravenous doses employed for various    diagnostic indications are as follows: Liver/spleen imaging: The dose range    is 0.56 to 2.78 megabecquerels (15 to 75 microcuries) per kilogram of body weight    with a usual dose of 1.85 megabecquerels (50 microcuries) per kg body weight,    except in newborns in whom the administered dose should be 7.4 to 18.5 megabecquerels    (200 to 500 microcuries). A minimum dose of 7.4 megabecquerels (200 microcuries)    should be employed for this procedure.
Bone marrow imaging: The dose range is 1.11 to 5.55 megabecquerels (30 to 150    microcuries) per kilogram of body weight. A minimum dose of 22.2 megabecquerels    (600 microcuries) is suggested for this procedure. (See Table 5)
In average ADULT (70 kg) patients: The suggested oral dose range is 5.55-11.1    megabecquerels (150-300 microcuries) for gastroesophageal studies. The suggested    oral dose range for pulmonary aspiration studies is 11.1-18.5 megabecquerels    (300-500 microcuries).
In PEDIATRIC patients: The suggested oral dose range in infants and children    is 3.7-11.1 megabecquerels (100-300 microcuries) for gastroesophageal and pulmonary    aspiration studies.
The drug should be incorporated into a milk feeding when administered orally.    Equally good results may be obtained by intubating the stomach and directly    instilling the material into the stomach, followed by a dextrose or milk meal.    This latter method avoids the introduction of radiation into the esophagus:    thus, any tracer appearing there must be due to reflux.
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration    system immediately prior to administration. Parenteral drug products should    be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  
The suggested intraperitoneal dosage range used in the average patient (70    kg) for peritoneo-venous (LeVeen) shunt patency evaluation is 37 to 111 megabecquerels    (1 to 3 millicuries). Adequate measures should be taken to assure uniform mixing    with peritoneal fluid. Serial images of both the shunt and target organ should    be obtained and correlated with other clinical findings. Alternately, the drug    may be administered by percutaneous transtubal injection. The suggested percutaneous    transtubal (efferent limb) dosage range for the average patient (70 kg) is 12    to 37 megabecquerels (0.3 to 1.0 millicurie) in a volume not to exceed 0.5 mL.  
Transperitoneal absorption of Sulfur Colloid may occur, but it occurs slowly.    Therefore, the most definitive scintigraphic evaluation of shunt patency will    be obtained if there is visualization of both the shunt itself and the liver    and/or spleen within the first three hours post intraperitoneal injection.
The estimated absorbed radiation doses2 to an average ADULT patient    (70 kg) from an intravenous injection of a maximum dose of 296 megabecquerels    (8 millicuries) of Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid Injection are shown in Table    4.

In PEDIATRIC patients, the radiation absorbed doses, using the maximum recommended    doses for liver/spleen imaging [2.78 megabecquerels (75 microcuries) per kilogram    of body weight] and for bone marrow imaging [5.55 megabecquerels (150 microcuries)    per kilogram of body weight], except in the newborn where the doses used for    calculating the radiation absorbed dose estimates are 18.5 megabecquerels (500    microcuries) for liver/spleen imaging and 22.2 megabecquerels (600 microcuries)    for bone marrow imaging, are shown in Table 5.

Calculations for the absorbed radiation dose are based upon an effective half-time    of 3 hours for the open shunt and 6.02 hours for the closed shunt and an even    distribution of the radiopharmaceutical in the peritoneal cavity with no biological    clearance.
