Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of VICOPROFEN (hydrocodone and ibuprofen)  and other    treatment options before deciding to use VICOPROFEN (hydrocodone and ibuprofen) . Use the lowest effective    dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment    goals (see WARNINGS).
After observing the response to initial therapy with VICOPROFEN (hydrocodone and ibuprofen) , the dose and    frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
For the short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of acute pain,    the recommended dose of VICOPROFEN (hydrocodone and ibuprofen)  is one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as necessary.    Dosage should not exceed 5 tablets in a 24-hour period. It should be kept in    mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related.
The lowest effective dose or the longest dosing interval should be sought for    each patient (see WARNINGS), especially in the elderly. After observing    the initial response to therapy with VICOPROFEN (hydrocodone and ibuprofen) , the dose and frequency of dosing    should be adjusted to suit the individual patient's need, without exceeding    the total daily dose recommended.
