One to two drops of IOPIDINE 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution should be instilled in the affected eye(s) three times daily. Since IOPIDINE 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution will be used with other ocular glaucoma therapies, an approximate 5 minute interval between instillation of each medication should be practiced to prevent washout of the previous dose. NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. NOT FOR ORAL INGESTION.
