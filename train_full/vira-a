Administer approximately one-half inch of VIRA-A (vidarabine)  Ophthalmic Ointment, 3%, into the lower conjunctival  sac five times daily at three-hour intervals.
If there are no signs of improvement after 7 days, or complete re-epithelialization has not occurred by 21 days, other forms of therapy should be considered. Some severe cases may require longer treatment.
Too frequent administration should be avoided.
After re-epithelialization has occurred, treatment for an additional 7 days at a reduced dosage (such as twice daily) is recommended in order to prevent recurrence.
The following topical antibiotics: gentamicin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol; or topical steroids: prednisolone or dexamethasone have been administered concurrently with VIRA-A (vidarabine)  Ophthalmic Ointment, 3%.
