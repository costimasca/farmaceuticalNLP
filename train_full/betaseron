The recommended starting dose is 0.0625 mg (0.25 mL) subcutaneously every other day, with dose increases over a sixweek period to the recommended dose of 0.25 mg (1 mL) every other day (see Table 1).
Table 1: Schedule for Dose Titration 
If a dose of BETASERON is missed, then it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers or is able to take it. The patient should not take BETASERON on two consecutive days. The next injection should be taken about 48 hours (two days) after that dose. If the patient accidentally takes more than their prescribed dose, or takes it on two consecutive days, they should be instructed to call their healthcare provider immediately.
Concurrent use of analgesics and/or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu-like symptoms associated with BETASERON use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
