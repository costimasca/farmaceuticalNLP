The recommended dosage of VARUBI in adults in combination with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone is shown in Table 1. There is no drug interaction between rolapitant and dexamethasone, so no dosage adjustment for dexamethasone is required. Administer a dexamethasone dose of 20 mg on Day 1 [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Administer VARUBI prior to the initiation of each chemotherapy cycle, but at no less than 2 week intervals.
Administer VARUBI without regards to meals.
