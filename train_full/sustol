The recommended dosage of SUSTOL is 10 mg administered subcutaneously. Administer SUSTOL in combination with dexamethasone at least 30 minutes before the initiation of MEC or AC combination chemotherapy. Administer SUSTOL on Day 1 of chemotherapy and not more frequently than once every 7 days because of the extended-release properties of the formulation.
For patients receiving MEC, the recommended dexamethasone dosage is 8 mg intravenously on Day 1. For patients receiving AC combination chemotherapy regimens, the recommended dexamethasone dosage is 20 mg intravenously on Day 1, followed by 8 mg orally, twice a day, on Days 2, 3 and 4.
If SUSTOL is administered with an NK1 receptor antagonist, see the prescribing information of the NK1 receptor antagonist for the recommended dexamethasone dosage.
In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 59 mL/min), administer SUSTOL on Day 1 of chemotherapy and not more frequently than once every 14 days. Avoid SUSTOL in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min) [see Use In Specific Populations].
