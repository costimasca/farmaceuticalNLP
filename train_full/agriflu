Shake each pre-filled syringe to aid inspection before administering the vaccine and shake the multi-dose vial each time before withdrawing a dose of vaccine. Inspect AGRIFLU visually for the presence of particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration, whenever suspension and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, do not use the contents. (see DESCRIPTION)
Between uses, return the multi-dose vial to the recommended storage conditions between 2째 and 8째C (36째 and 46째F). A separate sterile syringe and needle must be used for each injection to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one person to another. It is recommended that small syringes (0.5 mL or 1 mL) should be used to minimize any product loss.
Do not use the vaccine if it has been frozen. Needles should be disposed of properly and not recapped.
AGRIFLUshould be administered as a single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection, preferably in the region of the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.
The vaccine should not be injected in the gluteal region or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk.
