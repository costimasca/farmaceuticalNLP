There is intersubject variation in the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and incidence of side effects with SORIATANE. A number of the more common side effects are dose-related. Individualization of dosage is required to achieve sufficient therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Therapy with SORIATANE should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg per day, given as a single dose with the main meal. Maintenance doses of 25 to 50 mg per day may be given dependent upon an individual patient's response to initial treatment. Relapses may be treated as outlined for initial therapy.
When SORIATANE is used with  phototherapy, the prescriber should decrease the phototherapy dose, dependent on the patient's individual response (see PRECAUTIONS: General).

SORIATANE must only be dispensed in no more than a monthly supply. A SORIATANE Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time SORIATANE is dispensed, as required by law.
