The recommended dosage is 1 or 2 mL (8,500 to 17,000 I.U.) or 1 or 2 full measuring scoops (each full measuring scoop equals 1mL; 28 drops from the SUCRAID container tip equals 1mL) taken orally with each meal or snack diluted with 2 to 4 ounces of water, milk or infant formula. The beverage or infant formula should be served cold or at room temperature. The beverage or infant formula should not be warmed or heated before or after addition of SUCRAID because heating is likely to decrease potency. SUCRAID should not be reconstituted or consumed with fruit juice since its acidity may reduce the enzyme activity.
It is recommended that approximately half of the dosage be taken at the beginning of the meal or snack and the remainder be taken during the meal or snack.
The recommended dosage is as follows:
1 mL (8,500 I.U.) (one full measuring scoop or 28 drops) per meal or snack for patients up to 15 kg in body weight.
2mL (17,000 I.U.) (two full measuring scoops or 56 drops) per meal or snack for patients over 15 kg in body weight.
Dosage may be measured with the 1 mL measuring scoop (provided) or by drop count method (1mL equals 28 drops from the SUCRAID container tip).
