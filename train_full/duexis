Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of DUEXIS and other treatment options before deciding to use DUEXIS. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended daily dose of DUEXIS (ibuprofen and famotidine) 800 mg/26.6 mg is a single tablet administered orally three times per day.
DUEXIS tablets should be swallowed whole, and should not be cut to supply a lower dose. Do not chew, divide, or crush tablets.
Patients should be instructed that if a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon possible. However, if the next scheduled dose is due, the patient should not take the missed dose, and should be instructed to take the next dose on time. Patients should be instructed not to take 2 doses at one time to make up for a missed dose.
