NOTE: ZYDERM collagen implant should be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures. DO NOT FREEZE.
Prior to test implantation with ZYDERM collagen implant, the patient should be provided with a copy of the Patient Brochure. The patient should be fully apprised of the indications, contraindications, warnings, precautions, treatment-associated reactions, adverse reactions, and method of administration of ZYDERM collagen implant. Patients also should be advised that supplemental “touch-up” implantations may be required to maintain maximum correction.
Occasionally, a normal skin test will exhibit a palpable      bead of collagen in the absence of inflammation, swelling or pruritus. If the     test implantation response is equivocal, it is recommended that a second test     implantation be administered in the opposite arm and evaluated prior to the     initiation of treatment. The majority of retest responses will occur within 72     hours; however, the repeat test also should be observed for the full 4 weeks.
Clinical experience has shown that the screening of the test implant cannot be overemphasized. However, a negative skin test does not preclude the possibility of the patient subsequently developing a delayed hypersensitivity response to the implant material following additional exposures.
(For those patients not exhibiting an untoward test response):
