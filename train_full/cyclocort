Apply a thin layer to affected area once or twice daily and gently rub in. Allow adequate time for absorption after each application before applying an emollient.
CYCLOCORT® should not be used for longer than 5 days on the face, axillae, scrotum and scalp (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS).
CYCLOCORT® should not be used for longer than 2 to 3 weeks on the body (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS). If the condition worsens or does not improve within 2 weeks, treatment and diagnosis should be re-evaluated.
Avoid abrupt discontinuation of CYCLOCORT® therapy once control is achieved as rebound of pre-existing dermatoses can occur. Continue an emollient as maintenance therapy.
The safety and effectiveness of CYCLOCORT® in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not been established (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Special Populations, Pediatrics (< 18 Years Of Age)).
CYCLOCORT® should be used with caution in geriatric patients due to increased risk of renal or hepatic impairment in this population. The minimum quantity should be used for the shortest duration to achieve the desired therapeutic benefit (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Special Populations, Geriatrics (> 65 Years Of Age)).
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the minimum quantity should be used for the shortest duration to achieve the desired therapeutic benefit (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Special Populations, Patients With Renal / Hepatic Impairment).
In the event of a missed dose, CYCLOCORT® should be applied as soon as possible after the missed dose is remembered. If this is close to the scheduled application time or the next dose, the patient should wait and apply the next scheduled dose. The usual schedule should be resumed thereafter.
