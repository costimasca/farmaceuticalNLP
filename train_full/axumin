Axumin is a radioactive drug and should be handled with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure during administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Use waterproof gloves and effective shielding, including syringe shields, when handling and administering Axumin.
The recommended dose is 370 MBq (10 mCi) administered as an intravenous bolus injection.
Position the patient supine with arms above the head. Begin PET scanning 3 to 5 minutes after completion of the Axumin injection. It is recommended that image acquisition should start from midthigh and proceed to the base of the skull. Typical total scan time is between 20 to 30 minutes.
Localization of prostate cancer recurrence in sites typical for prostate cancer recurrence is based on fluciclovine F 18 uptake in comparison with tissue background. For small lesions (less than 1cm in diameter) focal uptake greater than blood pool should be considered suspicious for prostate cancer recurrence. For larger lesions, uptake equal to or greater than bone marrow is considered suspicious for prostate cancer recurrence.
The radiation absorbed doses estimated for adult patients following intravenous injection of Axumin are shown in Table 1. Values were calculated from human biodistribution data using OLINDA/EXM (Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment/Exponential Modeling) software.
The (radiation absorbed) effective dose resulting from the administration of the recommended activity of 370 MBq of Axumin is 8 mSv. For an administered activity of 370 MBq (10 mCi), the highestmagnitude radiation doses are delivered to the pancreas, cardiac wall, and uterine wall: 38 mGy, 19 mGy, and 17 mGy, respectively. If a CT scan is simultaneously performed as part of the PET procedure, exposure to ionizing radiation will increase in an amount dependent on the settings used in the CT acquisition.
