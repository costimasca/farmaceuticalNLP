BLOXIVERZ should be administered by trained healthcare providers familiar with the use, actions, characteristics, and complications of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) and neuromuscular block reversal agents. Doses of BLOXIVERZ should be individualized, and a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to determine the time of initiation of BLOXIVERZ and should be used to determine the need for additional doses.
BLOXIVERZ is for intravenous use only and should be injected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute. The BLOXIVERZ dosage is weight-based [see Dosage in Adults].
Prior to BLOXIVERZ administration and until complete recovery of normal ventilation, the patient should be well ventilated and a patent airway maintained. Satisfactory recovery should be judged by adequacy of skeletal muscle tone and respiratory measurements in addition to the response to peripheral nerve stimulation.
An anticholinergic agent, e.g., atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate, should be administered prior to or concomitantly with BLOXIVERZ [see Anticholinergic (Atropine or Glycopyrrolate) Administration]
Adult guidelines should be followed when BLOXIVERZ is administered to pediatric patients. Pediatric patients require BLOXIVERZ doses similar to those for adult patients.
An anticholinergic agent, e.g., atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate, should be administered prior to or concomitantly with BLOXIVERZ. The anticholinergic agent should be administered intravenously using a separate syringe. In the presence of bradycardia, it is recommended that the anticholinergic agent be administered prior to BLOXIVERZ.
