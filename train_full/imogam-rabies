Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to administration,  whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exist, the vaccine should not be administered. 
Imogam® Rabies - HT (rabies immune globulin (human))  should be used in conjunction with Rabies Vaccine such   as Rabies Vaccine Imovax® Rabies,  for intramuscular immunization,  vaccine   prepared from human diploid cell cultures.  The recommended dose of Imogam®   Rabies - HT is 20 IU/kg (0. 133 mL/kg) or 9 IU/lb (0. 06 mL/lb) of body weight   administered at time of the first vaccine dose.  25, 26, 43 The gluteal   area should never be used for HDCV,  RVA,  or PCEC injections because administration   of HDCV in this area results in lower neutralizing antibody titers. 1, 43, 44   If anatomically feasible,  the full dose of Rabies Immune Globulin (Human) (RIG)   should be thoroughly infiltrated in the area around and into the wounds.  Any   remaining volume should be injected intramuscularly at a site distant from vaccine   administration. 1 Two injections would be given in the gluteal muscle if the   volume is greater than 5 mL. 
Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) should never be administered in the    same syringe or into the same anatomical site as vaccine.  Because HRIG may partially    suppress active production of antibody,  no more than the recommended dose should    be given. 1, 27
