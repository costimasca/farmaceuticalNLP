The onset of action of Prostigmin (neostigmine)  given orally is slower than when given parenterally,    but the duration of action is longer and the intensity of action more uniform.    Dosage requirements for optimal results vary from 15 mg to 375 mg per day. In    some instances it may be necessary to exceed these dosages, but the possibility    of cholinergic crisis must be recognized. The average dose is 10 tablets (150    mg) administered over a 24-hour period. The interval between doses is of paramount    importance. The dosage schedule should be adjusted for each patient and changed    as the need arises. Frequently, therapy is required day and night. Larger portions    of the total daily dose may be given at times when the patient is more prone    to fatigue (afternoon, mealtimes, etc.). The patient should be encouraged to    keep a daily record of his or her condition to assist the physician in determining    an optimal therapeutic regimen.
