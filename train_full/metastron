The recommended dose of Metastron is 148 MBq, 4 mCi, administered by slow intravenous injection (1-2 minutes). Alternatively, a dose of 1.5 -2.2 MBq/kg, 40-60 μCi/kg body weight may be used.
Repeated administrations of Metastron should be based on an individual patient's response to therapy, current symptoms, and hematologic status, and are generally not recommended at intervals of less than 90 days.
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.
The estimated radiation dose that would be delivered over time by the intravenous injection of 37 MBq, 1 mCi of Strontium-89 to a normal healthy adult is given in Table 4. Data are taken from the ICRP publication “Radiation Dose to Patients from Radiopharmaceuticals”-ICRP #53, Vol. 18, No. 1-4, Page 171, Pergamon Press, 1988.
Table 4: Strontium-89 Dosimetry 
When blastic osseous metastases are present, significantly enhanced localization of the radiopharmaceutical will occur with correspondingly higher doses to the metastases compared with normal bones and other organs.
The radiation dose hazard in handling Strontium-89 Chloride injection during dose dispensing and administration is similar to that from phosphorus-32. The beta emission has a range in water of about 8 mm (max.) and in glass of about 3 mm, but the bremsstrahlung radiation may augment the contact dose.
Measured values of the dose on the surface of the unshielded vial are about 65 mR/minute/mCi.
It is recommended that the vial be kept inside its transportation shield whenever possible.
