For intramuscular administration only.
Children 2 months to  < 3 years of age: Primary  immunization with IXIARO consists of two (2) 0.25 mL doses, administered 28 days apart.
Individuals 3 years of age and older: Primary immunization with IXIARO consists of two (2) 0.5 mL doses, administered 28 days apart.
Complete the primary immunization series at least 1 week prior to potential exposure to JEV.
Individuals 17 years of age and older: If the primary series of two doses was completed more than 1 year previously, a booster dose may be given if ongoing exposure or re-exposure to JEV is expected.
Infants, children and adolescents 2 months to  < 17 years of age: The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose has not been evaluated.
IXIARO is administered intramuscularly. The preferred sites for intramuscular injection are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants 2 to 11 months of age, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (or the  deltoid muscle if muscle mass is adequate) in children 1 to  < 3 years of age, or the deltoid muscle in individuals 3 years of age and older.
Do not administer intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.
Prior to agitation, IXIARO is a clear liquid with a white precipitate. Before administration, shake the syringe well to obtain a white, opaque, homogeneous suspension.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If either of these conditions exists, do not administer.
*If the plunger stopper is pushed beyond the red line, do not administer the vaccine. Repeat the procedure using a new pre-filled syringe.
