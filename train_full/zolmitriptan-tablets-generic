The recommended starting dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally-scored 2.5 mg tablet in half. The maximum recommended single dose of zolmitriptan tablets is 5 mg.
In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose.
If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking zolmitriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24-hour period.
The safety of zolmitriptan tablets in the treatment of an average of more than three migraines in a 30-day period has not been established.
The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one-half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablets) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day.
If zolmitriptan tablets is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
