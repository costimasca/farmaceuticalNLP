Just before use, shake the vial well, until a uniform, white, cloudy suspension results.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exist, the product should not be administered.
Using a sterile needle and syringe and aseptic technique, withdraw and administer a 0.5 mL dose of Quadracel vaccine intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.
