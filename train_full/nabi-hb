This product is for intramuscular use only.  The use of this product by the   intravenous route is not indicated.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected   visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
It is important to use a separate vial, sterile syringe, and needle for each   individual patient, in order to prevent transmission of infectious agents from   one person to another.  Any vial of Nabi-HB, Hepatitis B Immune Globulin   (Human) that has been entered should be used promptly. Do not reuse or save   for future use.  This product contains no preservative; therefore, partially   used vials should be discarded immediately.
Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) may be administered at the same time (but   at a different site), or up to one month preceding hepatitis B vaccination without   impairing the active immune response to hepatitis B vaccine11.

Women admitted for delivery, who were not screened for HBsAg during the prenatal    period, should be tested.  While test results are pending, the newborn infant   should receive hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth (see manufacturers'   recommendations for dose).  If the mother is later found to be HBsAg-positive,   the infant should receive 0.5 mL Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) as soon   as possible and within seven days of birth; however, the efficacy of Hepatitis   B Immune Globulin (Human) administered after 48 hours of age is not known10,19.   Testing for HBsAg and anti-HBs is recommended at 12-15 months of age.  If  HBsAg   is not detectable and anti-HBs is present, the child has been protected12.
