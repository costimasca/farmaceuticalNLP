The written prescription for NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  should include the full    name, to avoid confusion with NovoLog® (insulin aspart) and NovoLog®    Mix 70/30 (70% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 30% insulin aspart injection,    (rDNA origin). 
NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  should be administered within 15 minutes of meal initiation    up to three times daily. It is intended only for subcutaneous injection into    the abdominal wall, thigh, or upper arm. NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  should not be    administered intravenously.
No clinical studies have been conducted comparing NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  to    proportionate doses of insulin aspart (NovoLog®) and an intermediate-acting    insulin that are mixed by the patient prior to injection. Initiating or switching    to a regimen that contains a NovoLog® Mix formulation, as with any change    in an insulin regimen, will require careful blood glucose monitoring to ensure    adequacy of glycemic control and to avoid hypoglycemia.
Dose regimens of NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  will vary among patients and should    be determined by the health care professional familiar with the patient's lifestyle    variables. As with all insulins, the duration of action may vary according to    the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature, and level of physical activity    and conditioning.
PenFill®Cartridges for 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible delivery    devices*
NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  PenFill® suspension should be visually inspected    and resuspended immediately before use. The resuspended NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)     must appear uniformly white and cloudy. Before inserting the cartridge into    the insulin delivery system, roll the cartridge between your palms 10 times.  
The cartridge should be kept horizontal while rolling. Thereafter, turn the    cartridge upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge    to the other. Do this at least 10 times. The rolling and turning procedure must    be repeated until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Mixing    is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature. Inject immediately.    Before each subsequent injection, turn the 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible    delivery devices* upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the    cartridge to the other. Repeat this at least 10 times until the suspension appears    uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately.
Always remove the needle after each injection and store the 3 mL PenFill®    cartridge compatible delivery device without a needle attached. This prevents    contamination and/or infection, entry of air into the insulin reservoir, or    leakage of insulin and will ensure accurate dosing. Always use a new needle    for each injection to prevent contamination. Used needles or lancets should    be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic    containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty    coffee can). Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly. 
*NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  PenFill® cartridges are designed for use with Novo    Nordisk 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible insulin delivery devices, with    or without the addition of a NovoPen® 3 PenMate®, and NovoFine®    disposable needles.
NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  suspension should be visually inspected and resuspended    immediately before use. The resuspended NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  must appear uniformly    white and cloudy. Before use, roll the disposable NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  FlexPen®    Prefilled syringe between your palms 10 times. This procedure should be carried    out with the NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  FlexPen® Prefilled syringe in a horizontal    position. Thereafter, turn the disposable NovoLog® Mix 50/50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection)  FlexPen®    Prefilled syringe upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the    reservoir to the other.
