Initiate treatment with 1.25 mg given once a day for at least 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, the dose may be increased to 2.5 mg given once a day if a desired benefit has not been achieved and the patient is tolerating ZELAPAR. There is no evidence that doses greater than 2.5 mg a day provide additional benefit, and they should ordinarily be avoided because of the potential increased risk of adverse events.
Take ZELAPAR in the morning before breakfast and without liquid. Patients should avoid ingesting food or liquids for 5 minutes before and after taking ZELAPAR.
Patients should not attempt to push ZELAPAR through the foil backing. Patients should PEEL BACK the backing of one or two blisters (as prescribed) with dry hands, and GENTLY remove the tablet(s). Patients should IMMEDIATELY place the ZELAPAR tablet(s) on top of the tongue where it will disintegrate in seconds.
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic disease (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9), the daily dose of ZELAPAR should be reduced (from 2.5 to 1.25 mg daily), depending on the clinical response. ZELAPAR is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
No dose adjustment of ZELAPAR is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 89 mL/min). The maintenance dose of ZELAPAR (1.25 mg or 2.5 mg) is determined by the individual clinical response. ZELAPAR is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with end-stage renal disease [ESRD] (creatinine clearance [CLcr]  < 30 mL/min) [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
