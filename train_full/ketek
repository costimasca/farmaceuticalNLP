The dosage of KETEK tablets is 800 mg (2 tablets of 400 mg) taken orally once daily for 7â€“10 days in patients 18 years or older. KETEK tablets can be administered with or without food.
In the presence of severe renal impairment (CLCR less than 30 mL/min), including patients who need dialysis, reduce the dosage of KETEK to 600 mg once daily. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, give KETEK after the dialysis session on dialysis days. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]
In the presence of severe renal impairment (CLCR less than 30 mL/min), with coexisting hepatic impairment, reduce the dosage of KETEK to 400 mg once daily. Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLCR of 30 mL/min or more) with or without coexisting hepatic impairment do not require a dosage adjustment. No dosage adjustments of KETEK are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment alone. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]
