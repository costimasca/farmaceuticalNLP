No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection.
Co-administration of BOTOX Cosmetic and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of BOTOX Cosmetic may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects.
The effect of administering different botulinum  neurotoxin products at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin.
Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of BOTOX Cosmetic.
