Table 1: Dosage Information 
Due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, a reduction in dosage of Precedex or other concomitant anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics or opioids may be required when co-administered [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
Dosage reductions may need to be considered for adult patients with hepatic impairment, and geriatric patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling of Precedex.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
Precedex must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to achieve required concentration (4 mcg/mL) prior to administration. Preparation of solutions is the same, whether for the loading dose or maintenance infusion.
To prepare the infusion, withdraw 2 mL of Precedex Injection, and add to 48 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a total of 50 mL. Shake gently to mix well.
Precedex in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is supplied in glass containers containing a premixed, ready to use dexmedetomidine hydrochloride solution in 0.9% sodium chloride in water. No further dilution of these preparations are necessary.
Precedex infusion should not be co-administered through the same intravenous catheter with blood or plasma because physical compatibility has not been established.
Precedex has been shown to be incompatible when administered with the following drugs: amphotericin B, diazepam.
Precedex has been shown to be compatible when administered with the following intravenous fluids:
Compatibility studies have demonstrated the potential for absorption of Precedex to some types of natural rubber. Although Precedex is dosed to effect, it is advisable to use administration components made with synthetic or coated natural rubber gaskets.
