The usual recommended starting dose of Tekturna is 150 mg once daily. In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled, the daily dose may be increased to 300 mg. Doses above 300 mg did not give an increased blood pressure response but resulted in an increased rate of diarrhea. The antihypertensive effect of a given dose is substantially attained (85% to 90%) by 2 weeks.
Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking Tekturna with regard to meals. High fat meals decrease absorption substantially [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
