Streptococcal Infections Group A—Infections of the upper-respiratory tract, skin and soft-tissue infections, scarlet fever, and erysipelas.
The following doses are recommended:
Adults and pediatric patients over 60 lbs. in weight: 2,400,000 units.
Pediatric patients from 30 to 60 lbs.: 900,000 units to 1,200,000 units.
Pediatric patients under 30 lbs.: 600,000 units.
NOTE: Treatment with the recommended dosage is usually given at a single session using multiple IM sites when indicated. An alternative dosage schedule may be used, giving one-half (½) the total dose on day 1 and one-half (½) on day 3. This will also insure the penicillinemia required over a 10-day period; however, this alternate schedule should be used only when the physician can be assured of the patient's cooperation.
600,000 units in pediatric patients and 1,200,000 units in adults, repeated every 2 or 3 days until the temperature is normal for 48 hours. Other forms of penicillin may be necessary for severe cases.
Bicillin C-R is intended for Intramuscular Injection ONLY. Do not inject into or near an artery or nerve, or intravenously or admix with other intravenous solutions. (See WARNINGS section).
Administer by DEEP INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION in the upper, outer quadrant of the buttock (dorsogluteal) or the anterolateral thigh (ventrogluteal). In neonates, infants and small children, the midlateral aspect of the thigh may be preferable. When doses are repeated, vary the injection site.
Because of the high concentration of suspended material in this product, the needle may be blocked if the injection is not made at a slow, steady rate.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
