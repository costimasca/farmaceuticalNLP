The recommended dose of CAPRELSA is 300 mg taken orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
CAPRELSA may be taken with or without food.
Do not take a missed dose within 12 hours of the next dose.
Do not crush CAPRELSA tablets. The tablets can be dispersed in 2 ounces of water by stirring for approximately 10 minutes (will not completely dissolve). Do not use other liquids for dispersion. Swallow immediately after dispersion. Mix any remaining residue with 4 additional ounces of water and swallow.
The dispersion can also be administered through nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes.
The 300 mg daily dose can be reduced to 200 mg (two 100 mg tablets) and then to 100 mg for Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or greater toxicities.
Interrupt CAPRELSA for the following:
For recurrent toxicities, reduce the dose of CAPRELSA to 100 mg after resolution or improvement to CTCAE Grade 1 severity, if continued treatment is warranted.
Because of the 19-day half-life, adverse reactions including a prolonged QT interval may not resolve quickly. Monitor appropriately [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance â‰¥30 to <50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use In Specific Populations].
CAPRELSA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment [see Use In Specific Populations].
