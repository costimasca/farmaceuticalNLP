Because food can reduce the bioavailability of zafirlukast, ACCOLATE should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.
The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in adults and children 12 years and older is 20 mg twice daily.
The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in children 5 through 11 years of age is 10 mg twice daily.
Based on cross-study comparisons, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in elderly patients (65 years of age and older), such that Cmax and AUC are approximately twice those of younger adults. In clinical trials, a dose of 20 mg twice daily was not associated with an increase in the overall incidence of adverse events or withdrawals because of adverse events in elderly patients.
ACCOLATE is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment including hepatic cirrhosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). The clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis such that the Cmax and AUC are approximately 50 - 60% greater than those of normal adults. ACCOLATE has not been evaluated in patients with hepatitis or in long-term studies of patients with cirrhosis.
Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment.
