Each Transderm ScopÂ® patch is formulated to deliver in-vivo approximately 1mg of scopolamine over 3 days. Only one patch should be worn at any time. Do not cut the patch.
The patch should be applied only to the skin in the postauricular (hairless area behind one ear) area.
After the patch is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, the hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and dried. Upon removal, the patch should be discarded. To prevent any traces of scopolamine from coming into direct contact with the eyes, after administration of the patch, the hands and the application site should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and dried. [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling and PATIENT INFORMATION]
For caesarian section surgery, to minimize exposure of the newborn baby to the drug, apply the patch one hour prior to caesarian section
Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed.
Should the patch become displaced, it should be discarded, and a fresh one placed on the hairless area behind the other ear.
If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, the first patch should be removed and a fresh one placed on the hairless area behind the other ear.
For perioperative use, the patch should be kept in place for 24 hours following surgery at which time it should be removed and discarded.
