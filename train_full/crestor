CRESTOR can be administered as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food. The tablet should be swallowed whole.
When initiating CRESTOR therapy or switching from another HMGCoA reductase inhibitor therapy, the appropriate CRESTOR starting dose should first be utilized, and only then titrated according to the patientâ€™s response and individualized goal of therapy.
After initiation or upon titration of CRESTOR, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and the dosage adjusted accordingly.

In homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the recommended dose is 20 mg orally once daily in patients 7 to 17 years of age.
In Asian patients, consider initiation of CRESTOR therapy with 5 mg once daily due to increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations. The increased systemic exposure should be taken into consideration when treating Asian patients not adequately controlled at doses up to 20 mg/day [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 5 mg once daily [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
