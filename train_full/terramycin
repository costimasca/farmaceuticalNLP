Adults:  The usual daily dose is 250 mg administered once every 24 hours or 300 mg given in divided doses at 8 to 12 hour intervals. 
For children above eight years of age:  15-25 mg/kg of body weight up to a maximum of 250 mg per single daily injection. Dosage may be divided and given at 8 to 12 hour intervals. 
Intramuscular therapy should be reserved for situations in which oral therapy is not feasible. 
The intramuscular administration of oxytetracycline produces lower blood levels than oral administration in the recommended dosages. Patients placed on intramuscular oxytetracycline should be changed to the oral dosage form as soon as possible. If rapid, high blood levels are needed, oxytetracycline should be administered intravenously. 
In patients with renal impairment:  (See " WARNINGS ") Total dosage should be decreased by reduction of recommended individual doses and/or by extending time intervals between doses.
