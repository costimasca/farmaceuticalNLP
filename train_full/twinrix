Shake well before use. With thorough agitation, TWINRIX is a slightly turbid white suspension. Do not administer if it appears otherwise. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.
For the prefilled syringes, attach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly.
For the vials, use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to withdraw the 1-mL dose and administer intramuscularly. Changing needles between drawing vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient is not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual.
TWINRIX should be administered by intramuscular injection only as a 1-mL dose. Administer in the deltoid  region. Do not administer in the gluteal region; such injections may result in a suboptimal response.
Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.
Standard dosing schedule consists of 3 doses (1 mL each), given intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months. Alternatively, an accelerated schedule of 4 doses (1 mL each), given intramuscularly on days 0, 7, and 21 to 30 followed by a booster dose at month 12 may be used.
