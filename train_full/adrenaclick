Selection of the appropriate Adrenaclick dosage strength is determined according to patient body weight.
Inject Adrenaclick intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, through clothing if necessary. Instruct caregivers of young children who are prescribed an Adrenaclick and who may be uncooperative and kick or move during an injection to hold the leg firmly in place and limit movement prior to and during an injection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Each Adrenaclick contains a single dose of epinephrine  for single use injection. Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from Adrenaclick are fixed, consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0.15 mg are deemed necessary.
The prescriber should carefully assess each patient to determine the most appropriate dose of epinephrine, recognizing the life-threatening nature of the reactions for which this drug is indicated.
With severe persistent anaphylaxis, repeat injections with an additional Adrenaclick may be necessary. More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The epinephrine solution in the viewing window of Adrenaclick should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration. Epinephrine is light sensitive and should be stored in the outer case provided to protect it from light [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling].
