Central Cranial Diabetes Insipidus: This drug is administered into the    nose through a soft, flexible plastic rhinal tube which has four graduation    marks on it that measure 0.2, 0.15, 0.1 and 0.05 mL. DDAVP Rhinal Tube (desmopressin acetate rhinal tube)     dosage must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according    to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters:    adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients    with nasal congestion and blockage have often responded well to intranasal DDAVP.    The usual dosage range in adults is 0.1 to 0.4 mL daily, either as a single    dose or divided into two or three doses. Most adults require 0.2 mL daily in    two divided doses. The morning and evening doses should be separately adjusted    for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. For children aged 3 months    to 12 years, the usual dosage range is 0.05 to 0.3 mL daily, either as a single    dose or divided into two doses. About 1/4 to 1/3 of patients can be controlled    by a single daily dose of DDAVP administered intranasally. Fluid restriction    should be observed. (See WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS,    Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use.)
Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the    kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients    with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have    decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may    be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics, CONTRAINDICATIONS,    and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.)
