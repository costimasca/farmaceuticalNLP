The recommended starting dosage of ORFADIN is 0.5 mg/kg orally twice daily. Titrate the dose for individual patients, as needed based on biochemical and/or clinical response. Adjust the dose of nitisinone individually. Monitor plasma and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations, liver function parameters and alpha-fetoprotein levels. If succinylacetone is still detectable one month after the start of nitisinone treatment, increase the nitisinone dosage to 0.75 mg/kg twice daily. A maximum dosage of 1 mg/kg orally twice daily may be needed based on the evaluation of all biochemical parameters.
If the biochemical response is satisfactory, the dosage should be adjusted only according to body weight gain.
In addition to the tests above, during the initiation of therapy or if there is a deterioration in the patient's condition, it may be necessary to follow all available biochemical parameters more closely (i.e. plasma succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte porphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity).
The oral suspension will be dispensed with an oral syringe of appropriate size and a bottle adaptor provided by a pharmacist or other healthcare provider.
