VisionBlue® (trypan blue)  is packaged in a 2.25 mL syringe to which a blunt cannula has to be attached.
After opening the eye, an air bubble is injected into the anterior chamber of the eye in order to minimize dilution of VisionBlue® (trypan blue)  by the aqueous. VisionBlue® (trypan blue)  is carefully applied onto the anterior lens capsule using a blunt cannula. Sufficient staining is achieved as soon as the dye has contacted the capsule. The anterior chamber is then irrigated with balanced salt solution to remove all excess dye. An anterior capsulotomy can then be performed.
