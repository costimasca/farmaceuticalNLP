Therapy with this product should be limited to 10 days. (See WARNINGS.)
The external auditory canal should be thoroughly cleansed and dried with a sterile cotton applicator.
When using the calibrated dropper:
For adults, 5 drops of the suspension should be instilled into the affected ear 3 or 4 times daily.
For pediatric patients, 4 drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal.
The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 5 minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.
If preferred, a cotton wick may be inserted into the canal and then the cotton may be saturated with the suspension. This wick should be kept moist by adding further solution every 4 hours. The wick should be replaced at least once every 24 hours.
