Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal  woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.
A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
Cenestin therapy consists of a single tablet taken orally once daily.
Patients should be started at Cenestin 0.45 mg daily. Subsequent dosage adjustment may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider. The lowest effective dose of Cenestin for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms has not been determined.
Cenestin therapy consists of a single tablet taken orally once daily.
When prescribing solely for the treatment of symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, topical vaginal products should be considered.
