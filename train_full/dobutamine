Do not add dobutamine injection to 5% Sodium Bicarbonate Injection or to any other strongly alkaline solution. Because of potential physical incompatibilities, it is recommended that dobutamine hydrochloride not be mixed with other drugs in the same solution. Dobutamine hydrochloride should not be used in conjunction with other agents or diluents containing both sodium bisulfite and ethanol.
At the time of administration, dobutamine injection must be further diluted in an IV container. Dilute 20 mL of dobutamine in at least 50 mL of diluent and dilute 40 mL of dobutamine in at least 100 mL of diluent. Use one of the following intravenous solutions as a diluent: Dextrose Injection 5%, Dextrose 5% and Sodium Chloride 0.45% Injection, Dextrose 5% and Sodium Chloride 0.9% Injection, Dextrose Injection 10%, Isolyte M with 5% Dextrose Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection, 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection, Normosol -M in D5-W, 20% Osmitrol in Water for Injection, Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9%, or Sodium Lactate Injection. Intravenous solutions should be used within 24 hours.
The rate of infusion needed to increase cardiac output usually ranged from 2.5 to 15 mcg/kg/min (see table). On rare occasions, infusion rates up to 40 mcg/kg/min have been required to obtain the desired effect.

Rates of infusion in mL/h for Dobutamine Injection concentrations of 500 mcg/mL, 1000 mcg/mL, and 2000 mcg/mL are given in Table 2.

The rate of administration and the duration of therapy should be adjusted according to the patient's response as determined by heart rate, presence of ectopic activity, blood pressure, urine flow, and, whenever possible, measurement of central venous or pulmonary wedge pressure and cardiac output.
Concentrations of up to 5,000 mcg/mL have been administered to humans (250 mg/50 mL). The final volume administered should be determined by the fluid requirements of the patient.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
