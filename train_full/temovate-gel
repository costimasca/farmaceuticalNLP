 Apply a thin layer of TEMOVATE Gel (clobetasol propionate gel)  to the affected skin areas twice daily    and rub in gently and completely (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).
TEMOVATE Gel (clobetasol propionate gel)  is a super-high potency topical corticosteroid; therefore, treatment    should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and amounts greater than 50 g/week    should not be used.
As with other highly active corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
TEMOVATE Gel (clobetasol propionate gel)  should not be used with occlusive dressings.
Geriatric Use: In studies where geriatric patients (65 years of age    or older, see PRECAUTIONS) have been treated    with TEMOVATE Gel (clobetasol propionate gel) , safety did not differ from that in younger patients; therefore,    no dosage adjustment is recommended.
