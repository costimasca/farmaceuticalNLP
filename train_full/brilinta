In the management of ACS, initiate BRILINTA treatment with a 180 mg loading dose. Administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year after an ACS event. After one year administer 60 mg twice daily.
Do not administer BRILINTA with another oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor.
Use BRILINTA with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Clinical Studies]. A patient who misses a dose of BRILINTA should take one tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time.
For patients who are unable to swallow tablets whole, BRILINTA tablets can be crushed, mixed with water and drunk. The mixture can also be administered via a nasogastric tube (CH8 or greater) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
