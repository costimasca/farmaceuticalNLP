The recommended dose of COMPLERA is one tablet taken orally once daily with food [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Because COMPLERA is a fixed-dose combination, it should not be prescribed for patients requiring dose reduction such as those with moderate or severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL per minute).
If COMPLERA is coadministered with rifabutin, an additional 25 mg tablet of rilpivirine (EdurantÂ®) once per day is recommended to be taken concomitantly with COMPLERA and with a meal for the duration of the rifabutin coadministration [See DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
