For topical use only. RHOFADE is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
Prime the RHOFADE pump before using for the first time. To do so, with the pump in the upright position, repeatedly depress the actuator until cream is dispensed and then pump three times. Discard the cream from priming actuations. It is only necessary to prime the pump before the first dose.
RHOFADE tubes do not require priming.
Apply a pea-sized amount of RHOFADE cream, once daily in a thin layer to cover the entire face (forehead, nose, each cheek, and chin) avoiding the eyes and lips. Wash hands immediately after applying RHOFADE cream.
