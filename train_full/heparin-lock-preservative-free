To prevent clot formation in a heparin lock set or central venous catheter    following its proper insertion, Preservative-Free Heparin Lock Flush Solution,   USP is injected via the injection hub in a quantity sufficient to fill the entire   device. This solution should be replaced each time the device is used. Aspirate   before administering any solution via the device in order to confirm patency   and location of needle or catheter tip. If the drug to be administered is incompatible   with heparin, the entire device should be flushed with normal saline before   and after the medication is administered; following the second saline flush,   Preservative-Free Heparin Lock Flush Solution, USP may be reinstilled into the   device. The device manufacturer's instructions should be consulted for specifics   concerning its use.
