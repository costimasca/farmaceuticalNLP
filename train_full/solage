Patients require detailed instruction to obtain maximal benefits and to understand all the precautions necessary to use this product with greatest safety. The physician should review the Patient Information. Apply Solagé to the solar lentigines using the applicator tip while avoiding application to the surrounding skin. Use twice daily, morning and evening at least 8 hours apart, or as directed by a physician. Patients should not shower or bathe the treatment areas for at least 6 hours after application of Solagé. Special caution should be taken when applying Solagé to avoid the eyes, mouth, paranasal creases, and mucous membranes.
Application of Solagé may cause transitory stinging, burning or irritation.
Improvement continues gradually through the course of therapy and should be apparent by 24 weeks. Patients should avoid exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) or wear protective clothing while using Solagé. Data are not available to establish how or whether Solagé is degraded (either by sunlight or by normal interior lighting) following application to the skin.
With discontinuation of Solagé therapy, a majority of patients will experience some repigmentation over time of their lesions.
Applications of larger amounts of medication or more frequently than recommended will not lead to more rapid or better results, and marked redness, peeling, irritation, or hypopigmentation (abnormal lightening) of the skin may occur.
Patients treated with Solagé may use cosmetics but should wait 30 minutes before applying.
Not for oral, ophthalmic or intravaginal use.
