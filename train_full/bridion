BRIDION (sugammadex) injection, for intravenous use, should be administered by trained healthcare providers familiar with the use, actions, characteristics, and complications of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) and neuromuscular block reversal agents.
Doses and timing of BRIDION administration should be based on monitoring for twitch responses and the extent of spontaneous recovery that has occurred.
Administer BRIDION intravenously as a single bolus injection. The bolus injection may be given over 10 seconds, into an existing intravenous line. BRIDION has only been administered as a single bolus injection in clinical trials.
From the time of BRIDION administration until complete recovery of neuromuscular function, monitor the patient to assure adequate  ventilation and maintenance of a patent airway. Satisfactory recovery should be determined through assessment of skeletal muscle tone and respiratory measurements in addition to the response to peripheral nerve stimulation.
The recommended dose of BRIDION does not depend on the  anesthetic regimen.
BRIDION can be used to reverse different levels of rocuronium-or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade.
BRIDION dosing is based on actual body weight.
May inject BRIDION into the intravenous line of a running infusion with the following intravenous solutions:
Ensure the infusion line is adequately flushed (e.g., with 0.9% sodium chloride) between administration of BRIDION and other drugs.
Do not mix BRIDION with other products except those listed above.
BRIDION is physically incompatible with verapamil, ondansetron, and ranitidine.
Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.
