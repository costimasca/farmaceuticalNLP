The recommended dose is one to two drops of Betaxolol Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution (betaxolol hydrochloride)  in the affected eye(s) twice daily. In some patients, the intraocular pressure lowering responses to Betaxolol Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution (betaxolol hydrochloride)  may require a few weeks to stabilize. As with any new medication, careful monitoring of patients is advised. 
If the intraocular pressure of the patients is not adequately controlled on this regimen, concomitant therapy with pilocarpine and other miotics, and/or epinephrine and/or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be instituted.
