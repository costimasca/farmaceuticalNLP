The usual dosage in adult and pediatric patients is 6 grams per day administered   orally in divided doses of 3 grams twice daily. In pediatric patients less than   3 years of age, dosage may be started at 100 mg/kg/day divided in twice daily   doses, and then increased weekly by 50 mg/kg increments.
Therapy with Cystadane (betaine anhydrous)  should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in the    management of patients with homocystinuria. Patient response to Cystadane (betaine anhydrous)  can    be monitored by homocysteine plasma levels. Dosage in all patients can be gradually    increased until plasma total homocysteine is undetectable or present only in    small amounts. Response (by homocysteine plasma levels) usually occurs within    several days and steady state within a month. Plasma methionine concentrations    should be monitored in patients with CBS deficiency [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Dosages of up to 20 grams per day have been necessary to control homocysteine   levels in some patients. However, one pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic in   vitro simulation study indicated minimal benefit from exceeding a twice-daily   dosing schedule and a 150 mg/kg/day dosage for Cystadane (betaine anhydrous) .
The prescribed amount of Cystadane (betaine anhydrous)  should be measured with the measuring scoop   provided (one level 1.7 mL scoop is equal to 1 gram of betaine anhydrous powder)   and then dissolved in 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 mL) of water, juice, milk, or   formula, or mixed with food for immediate ingestion.
