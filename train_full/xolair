Administer Xolair 75 to 375 mg by subcutaneous injection every 2 or 4 weeks. Determine dose (mg) and dosing frequency by serum total IgE  level (IU/mL) measured before the start of treatment, and by body weight (kg).
Adjust doses for significant changes in body weight during treatment (see Table 1, 2 and 3).
Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment cannot be used as a guide for dose determination.
Periodically reassess the need for continued therapy based upon the patient's disease severity and level of asthma control.
Adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older: Initiate dosing according to Table 1 or 2.
Table 1: Subcutaneous Xolair Doses Every 4 Weeks for Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma 
Table 2: Subcutaneous Xolair Doses Every 2 Weeks for Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma 
Pediatric patients 6 to  < 12 years of age: Initiate dosing according to Table 3.
Table 3: Subcutaneous Xolair Doses Every 2 or 4 Weeks* for Pediatric Patients with Asthma Who Begin Xolair Between the Ages of 6 to  < 12 Years 
Administer Xolair 150 or 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks.
Dosing of Xolair in CIU patients is not dependent on serum IgE (free or total) level or body weight.
The appropriate duration of therapy for CIU has not been evaluated. Periodically reassess the need for continued therapy.
The supplied Xolair lyophilized powder must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) USP, using the following instructions:
Administer Xolair by subcutaneous injection. The injection may take 5-10 seconds to administer because the solution is slightly viscous. Do not administer more than 150 mg (contents of one vial) per injection site. Divide doses of more than 150 mg among two or more injection sites (Table 4).
