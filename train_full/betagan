The recommended starting dose is one to two drops of BETAGAN速 (levobunolol)  ophthalmic   solution 0.5% in the affected eye(s) once a day. Typical dosing with BETAGAN速 (levobunolol)    0.25% is one to two drops twice daily. In patients with more severe or uncontrolled   glaucoma, BETAGAN速 (levobunolol)  0.5% can be administered b.i.d. As with any new medication,   careful monitoring of patients is advised. Dosages above one drop of BETAGAN速 (levobunolol)    0.5% b.i.d. are not generally more effective. If the patient's IOP is not at   a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy with dipivefrin and/or   epinephrine, and/or pilocarpine and other miotics, and/or systemically administered   carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, can be instituted. Patients   should not typically use two or more topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking   agents simultaneously.
