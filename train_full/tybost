Administer TYBOST in conjunction with atazanavir or darunavir and other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of adults with HIV-1 infection. The recommended dosages of TYBOST and atazanavir or darunavir given with food are presented in Table 1. TYBOST must be coadministered at the same time as atazanavir or darunavir [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Consult the prescribing information for atazanavir or darunavir.
Table 1 : Recommended Dosing Regimens 
Prior to starting TYBOST, assess estimated creatinine clearance because TYBOST decreases estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular  function [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. When coadministering TYBOST with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), assess estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein at baseline [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
TYBOST coadministered with tenofovir DF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min because dose adjustment of tenofovir DF is required below 50 mL/min and such dose adjustments have not been established for coadministration with TYBOST [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS].
