The maximum recommended daily dose is 60 mL (960 mg trimethoprim) per day.

When renal function is impaired, a reduced dosage should be employed, as shown in Table 2.
Table 2: Impaired Renal Function Dosage Guidelines 
Administer the solution by intravenous infusion over a period of 60 to 90 minutes. Avoid administration by rapid infusion or bolus injection. Do NOT administer BACTRIM intramuscularly.
Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.
BACTRIM must be diluted. Each 5 mL should be added to 125 mL of 5% dextrose in water. After diluting with 5% dextrose in water, the solution should not be refrigerated and should be used within 6 hours.
If a dilution of 5 mL per 100 mL of 5% dextrose in water is desired, it should be used within 4 hours.
In those instances where fluid restriction is desirable, each 5 mL may be added to 75 mL of 5% dextrose in water. Under these circumstances the solution should be mixed just prior to use and should be administered within 2 hours.
If upon visual inspection there is cloudiness or evidence of crystallization after mixing, the solution should be discarded and a fresh solution prepared.
Do NOT mix Bactrim in 5% dextrose in water with drugs or solutions in the same container.
After initial entry into the vial, the remaining contents must be used within 48 hours.
The following infusion systems have been tested and found satisfactory: unit-dose glass containers; unit-dose polyvinyl chloride and polyolefin containers. No other systems have been tested and therefore no others can be recommended.
