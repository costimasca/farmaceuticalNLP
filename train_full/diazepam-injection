Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. The usual recommended    dose in older children and adults ranges from 2 mg to 20 mg I.M. or I.V., depending    on the indication and its severity. In some conditions, e.g., tetanus, larger    doses may be required. (See dosage for specific indications.) In acute conditions    the injection may be repeated within one hour although an interval of 3 to 4    hours is usually satisfactory. Lower doses (usually 2 mg to 5 mg) and slow increase    in dosage should be used for elderly or debilitated patients and when other    sedative drugs are administered. (See WARNINGS    and ADVERSE REACTIONS.)
For dosage in infants above the age of 30 days and children, see the specific indications below. When intravenous use is indicated, facilities for respiratory assistance should be readily available.
Intramuscular: Diazepam Injection, USP should be injected deeply    into the muscle.
Intravenous use: (See WARNINGS,    particularly for use in children.) The solution should be injected slowly, taking    at least one minute for each 5 mg (1 mL) given. Do not use small veins, such    as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Extreme care should be taken to    avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation.
Do not mix or dilute diazepam with other solutions or drugs in syringe or infusion flask. If it is not feasible to administer diazepam directly I.V., it may be injected slowly through the infusion tubing as close as possible to the vein insertion.
Once the acute symptomatology has been properly controlled with diazepam injection, the patient may be placed on oral therapy with diazepam if further treatment is required.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit    (see PRECAUTIONS). NOTE: Solution    may appear colorless to light yellow.
