TO BE ADMINISTERED INTRAMUSCULARLY ONLY
Infant dose: For infants under 2500 grams—900 units/kg/24 hours in 2 or 3 divided doses. For infants over 2500 grams—1,000 units/kg/24 hours, in 2 or 3 divided doses. Intramuscular injections of the solution should be given in the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks, alternating right and left and avoiding multiple injections in the same region because of the transient pain following injection.
Should be dissolved in sodium chloride injection containing 2 percent procaine hydrochloride. The concentration of the  antibiotic in the solution should not be less than 5,000 units per mL or more than 10,000 units per mL.
Diluents containing parabens should not be used to reconstitute bacitracin; cloudy solutions and precipitate formation have occurred.
Reconstitution of the 50,000 unit vial with 9.8 mL of diluent will result in a concentration of 5,000 units per mL.
Solutions are stable for one week when stored in a refrigerator 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F).
