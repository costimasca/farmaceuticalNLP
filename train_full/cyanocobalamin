Avoid using the intravenous route. Use of this product intravenously will result in almost all of the vitamin being lost in the urine.
Pernicious Anemia:Parenteral vitamin B12 is the recommended treatment   and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form   is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered   by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement   and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on   alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks.   By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should   be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly   if needed.
Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption: Where the oral route is   not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious   anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic   treatment should be with an oral B12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies   are present, they should be treated.
Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter   and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
