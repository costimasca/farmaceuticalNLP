The dose of Verelan should be individualized by titration. The usual daily dose of sustained-release verapamil, Verelan, in clinical trials has been 240 mg given by mouth once daily in the morning. However, initial doses of 120 mg a day may be warranted in patients who may have an increased response to verapamil (e.g., elderly, small people, etc.). Upward titration should be based on therapeutic efficacy and safety evaluated approximately 24 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effects of Verelan are evident within the first week of therapy.
If adequate response is not obtained with 120 mg of Verelan, the dose may be titrated upward in the following manner:
Verelan sustained-release capsules are for once-a-day administration. When switching from immediaterelease verapamil to Verelan capsules, the same total daily dose of Verelan capsules can be used.
As with immediate-release verapamil, dosages of Verelan capsules should be individualized and titration may be needed in some patients.
Verelan pellet filled capsules may also be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the pellets on a spoonful of applesauce. The applesauce should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with a glass of cool water to ensure complete swallowing of the pellets. The applesauce used should not be hot, and it should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. Any pellet/applesauce mixture should be used immediately and not stored for future use. Subdividing the contents of a Verelan capsule is not recommended.
