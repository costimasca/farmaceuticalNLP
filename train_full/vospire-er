The following dosages of albuterol extended-release tablets are expressed in    terms of albuterol base:
Adults and Children over 12 years of age: The usual recommended dosage    for adults and pediatric patients over 12 years of age is 8 mg every 12 hours.    In some patients, 4 mg every 12 hours may be sufficient.
Children 6 to 12 years of age: The usual recommended dosage for children    6 through 12 years of age is 4 mg every 12 hours.
Dosage adjustment in Adults and Children over 12 years of age: In unusual    circumstances, such as adults of low body weight, it may be desirable to use    a starting dosage of 4 mg every 12 hours and progress to 8 mg every 12 hours    according to response.
If control of reversible airway obstruction is not achieved with the recommended doses in patients on otherwise optimized asthma therapy, the doses may be cautiously increased stepwise under the control of the supervising physician to a maximum dose of 32 mg per day in divided doses (i.e., every 12 hours).
Dosage adjustment in Children 6 to 12 years of age: If control of reversible    airway obstruction is not achieved with the recommended doses in patients on    otherwise optimized asthma therapy, the doses may be cautiously increased stepwise    under the control of the supervising physician to a maximum dose of 24 mg per    day in divided doses (i.e., every 12 hours).
Switching from oral albuterol, USP products: Patients currently maintained    on albuterol tablets, USP or albuterol sulfate syrup can be switched to albuterol    extended-release tablets. For example, the administration of one 4 mg albuterol    extended-release tablet every 12 hours is comparable to one 2 mg albuterol tablet,    USP every 6 hours. Multiples of this regimen up to the maximum recommended daily    dose also apply.
Albuterol extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole with the aid of    liquids. DO NOT CHEW OR CRUSH THESE TABLETS.
