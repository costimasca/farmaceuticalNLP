Each bottle of Autoplex® T, Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex, Heat Treated,   is labeled with the number of Hyland Factor VIII Correctional Units that it   contains. One Hyland Factor VIII Correctional Unit is that quantity of activated   prothrombin complex which, upon addition to an equal volume of Factor VIII deficient   or inhibitor plasma, will correct the clotting time (ellagic acid-activated   partial thromboplastin time) to 35 seconds (normal).
The recommended dosage range is 25 to 100 Hyland Factor VIII Correctional Units   per kg of body weight, depending upon the severity of hemorrhage. If no hemostatic   improvement is observed approximately 6 hours following the initial administration,   the dosage should be repeated.
Subsequent dosage and administration intervals should be adjusted according    to the patient's clinical response. (See Laboratory    Tests.)
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
Note: Do not refrigerate after reconstitution.
It is recommended that Autoplex® T, Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex, Heat Treated, be infused initially at a rate of 2 mL/min. If infusion at this rate is well tolerated the administration rate may be gradually increased to 10 mL/min.
When reconstitution of Autoplex® T, Anti-Inhibitor Coagulant Complex, Heat Treated, is complete, its infusion should commence as soon as practical; however, it must be completed within 1 hour.
The reconstituted solution should be at room temperature during infusion.
When a Hyland administration set is used, follow directions for use printed on the administration set container. When an administration set from another source is used, follow directions accompanying that set where necessary. The use of a Hyland administration set is recommended as it contains a suitable filter.
