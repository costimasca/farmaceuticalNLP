The recommended starting dose of UPTRAVI is 200 micrograms (mcg) given twice daily. Tolerability may be improved when taken with food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Increase the dose in increments of 200 mcg twice daily, usually at weekly intervals, to the highest tolerated dose up to 1600 mcg twice daily. If a patient reaches a dose that cannot be tolerated, the dose should be reduced to the previous tolerated dose.
Do not split, crush, or chew tablets.
If a dose of medication is missed, patients should take a missed dose as soon as possible unless the next dose is within the next 6 hours.
If treatment is missed for 3 days or more, restart UPTRAVI at a lower dose and then retitrate.
No dose adjustment of UPTRAVI is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A).
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the starting dose of UPTRAVI is 200 mcg once daily. Increase in increments of 200 mcg once daily at weekly intervals, as tolerated [see Use in Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Avoid use of UPTRAVI in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
