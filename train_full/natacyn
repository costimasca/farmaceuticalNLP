SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING. The preferred initial dosage in fungal keratitis    is one drop of NATACYNÂ® (natamycin ophthalmic suspension) 5% instilled in    the conjunctival sac at hourly or two-hourly intervals. The frequency of application    can usually be reduced to one drop 6 to 8 times daily after the first 3 to 4    days. Therapy should generally be continued for 14 to 21 days or until there    is resolution of active fungal keratitis. In many cases, it may be helpful to    reduce the dosage gradually at 4 to 7 day intervals to assure that the replicating    organism has been eliminated. Less frequent initial dosage (4 to 6 daily applications)    may be sufficient in fungal blepharitis and conjunctivitis.
