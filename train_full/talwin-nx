The usual initial adult dose is 1 tablet every three or four hours. This may be increased to 2 tablets when needed. Total daily dosage should not exceed 12 tablets.
Due to the potential for withdrawal symptoms associated with abrupt discontinuation,    consideration should be given to tapering patients off TALWTN NX after prolonged    periods of treatment with TALWIN NX (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Abuse and Dependence).
