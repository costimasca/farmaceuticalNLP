HYDREA is used alone or in conjunction with other antitumor agents or radiation therapy to treat neoplastic diseases. Individualize treatment based on tumor type, disease state, response to treatment, patient risk factors, and current clinical practice standards.
Base all dosage on the patientâ€™s actual or ideal weight, whichever is less.
HYDREA is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see REFERENCES].
Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Monitor for the following and reduce the dose or discontinue HYDREA accordingly:
Monitor blood counts at least once a week during HYDREA therapy. Severe anemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with HYDREA. Consider dose modifications for other toxicities.
Reduce the dose of HYDREA by 50% in patients with measured creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 
Close monitoring of hematologic parameters is advised in these patients.
