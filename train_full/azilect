When AZILECT is prescribed as monotherapy or as adjunct therapy in patients not taking levodopa, patients may start AZILECT at the recommended dose of 1 mg administered orally once daily.
In patients taking levodopa, with or without other PD drugs (e.g., dopamine agonist, amantadine, anticholinergics), the recommended initial dose of AZILECT is 0.5 mg once daily. If the patient tolerates the daily 0.5 mg dose, but a sufficient clinical response is not achieved, the dose may be increased to 1 mg once daily. When AZILECT is used in combination with levodopa, a reduction of the levodopa dose may be considered, based upon individual response.
The recommended doses of AZILECT should not be exceeded because of risk of hypertension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Patients taking concomitant ciprofloxacin or other CYP1A2 inhibitors should not exceed a dose of AZILECT 0.5 mg once daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Patients with mild hepatic impairment should not exceed a dose of AZILECT 0.5 mg once daily. AZILECT should not be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
