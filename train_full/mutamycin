MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  should be given intravenously only, using care to avoid extrava-sation of the compound. If extravasation occurs, cellulitis, ulceration, and slough may result.
Each vial contains either mitomycin 5 mg and mannitol 10 mg, mitomycin 20 mg and mannitol 40 mg, or mitomycin 40 mg and mannitol 80 mg. To administer, add Sterile Water for Injection, 10 mL, 40 mL, or 80 mL respectively. Shake to dissolve. If product does not dissolve immediately, allow to stand at room temperature until solution is obtained.
After full hematological recovery (see guide to dosage adjustment) from   any previous chemotherapy, the following dosage schedule may be used at 6 to   8 week intervals:
20 mg/m2 intravenously as a single dose via a functioning intravenous   catheter.
Because of cumulative myelosuppression, patients should be fully reevaluated   after each course of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) , and the dose reduced if the patient has experienced   any toxicities. Doses greater than 20 mg/m2 have not been shown to   be more effective, and are more toxic than lower doses.
The following schedule is suggested as a guide to dosage adjustment:

No repeat dosage should be given until leukocyte count has returned to 4000/mm3   and platelet count to 100,000/mm3.
When MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin)  is used in combination with other myelosuppressive agents, the doses should be adjusted accordingly. If the disease continues to progress after two courses of MUTAMYCIN (mitomycin) , the drug should be stopped since chances of response are minimal.

Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should   be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.1-7   There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the   guidelines are necessary or appropriate.
