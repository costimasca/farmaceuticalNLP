Adjust dosage to individual and the severity of his condition, recognizing    that the milligram for milligram potency relationship among all dosage forms    has not been precisely established clinically. It is important to increase dosage    until symptoms are controlled. Dosage should be increased more gradually in    debilitated or emaciated patients. In continued therapy, gradually reduce dosage    to the lowest effective maintenance level, after symptoms have been controlled    for a reasonable period.
In general, dosage recommendations for other oral forms of the drug may be    applied to Spansule® brand sustained release capsules on the basis of total    daily dosage in milligrams.
The 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use in severe neuropsychiatric conditions.
Increase parenteral dosage only if hypotension has not occurred. Before using    I.M., see IMPORTANT NOTES ON INJECTION.
Elderly Patients — In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient    for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension    and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage    should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage    adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.
Psychotic Disorders — Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled.    Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue optimum    dosage for 2 weeks; then gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance    level. Daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages    (e.g., 800 mg daily is not uncommon in discharged mental patients).
HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS: ACUTE SCHIZOPHRENIC OR MANIC STATES — I.M.:    25 mg (1 mL). If necessary, give additional 25 to 50 mg injection in 1 hour.    Increase subsequent I.M. doses gradually over several days— up to 400    mg q4 to 6h in exceptionally severe cases— until patient is controlled.    Usually patient becomes quiet and cooperative within 24 to 48 hours and oral    doses may be substituted and increased until the patient is calm. 500 mg a day    is generally sufficient. While gradual increases to 2,000 mg a day or more may    be necessary, there is usually little therapeutic gain to be achieved by exceeding    1,000 mg a day for extended periods. In general, dosage levels should be lower    in the elderly, the emaciated and the debilitated. LESS ACUTELY DISTURBED—    Oral: 25 mg t.i.d. Increase gradually until effective dose is reached—    usually 400 mg daily. OUTPATIENTS— Oral: 10 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d., or 25    mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. MORE SEVERE CASES— Oral: 25 mg t.i.d. After 1 or 2    days, daily dosage may be increased by 20 to 50 mg at semiweekly intervals until    patient becomes calm and cooperative. PROMPT CONTROL OF SEVERE SYMPTOMS—    I.M.: 25 mg (1 mL). If necessary, repeat in 1 hour. Subsequent doses should    be oral, 25 to 50 mg t.i.d.
Nausea and Vomiting — Oral: 10 to 25 mg q4 to 6h, p.r.n., increased,    if necessary. I.M.: 25 mg (1 mL). If no hypotension occurs, give 25 to 50 mg    q3 to 4h, p.r.n., until vomiting stops. Then switch to oral dosage. Rectal:    One 100 mg suppository q6 to 8h, p.r.n. In some patients, half this dose will    do.
DURING SURGERY— I.M.: 12.5 mg (0.5 mL). Repeat in 1 / 2 hour if necessary    and if no hypotension occurs. I.V.: 2 mg per fractional injection, at 2-minute    intervals. Do not exceed 25 mg. Dilute to 1 mg/mL, i.e., 1 mL (25 mg) mixed    with 24 mL of saline.
Presurgical Apprehension — Oral: 25 to 50 mg, 2 to 3 hours before    the operation. I.M.: 12.5 to 25 mg (0.5 to 1 mL), 1 to 2 hours before operation.
Intractable Hiccups — Oral: 25 to 50 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.    If symptoms persist for 2 to 3 days, give 25 to 50 mg (1 to 2 mL) I.M. Should    symptoms persist, use slow I.V. infusion with patient flat in bed: 25 to 50    mg (1 to 2 mL) in 500 to 1,000 mL of saline. Follow blood pressure closely.
Acute Intermittent Porphyria — Oral: 25 to 50 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.    Can usually be discontinued after several weeks, but maintenance therapy may    be necessary for some patients. I.M.: 25 mg (1 mL) t.i.d. or q.i.d. until patient    can take oral therapy.
Tetanus — I.M.: 25 to 50 mg (1 to 2 mL) given 3 or 4 times daily,    usually in conjunction with barbiturates. Total doses and frequency of administration    must be determined by the patient's response, starting with low doses and increasing    gradually. I.V.: 25 to 50 mg (1 to 2 mL). Dilute to at least 1 mg per mL and    administer at a rate of 1 mg per minute.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION— PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (6 months to 12 years    of age)
Thorazine (chlorpromazine) should generally not be used in pediatric patients    under 6 months of age except where potentially lifesaving. It should not be    used in conditions for which specific pediatric dosages have not been established.
Severe Behavioral Problems — OUTPATIENTS— Select route of administration    according to severity of patient's condition and increase dosage gradually as    required. Oral: 1 / 4 mg/lb body weight q4 to 6h, p.r.n. (e.g., for 40 lb child—    10 mg q4 to 6h). Rectal: 1 / 2 mg/lb body weight q6 to 8h, p.r.n. (e.g., for    20 to 30 lb child— half a 25 mg suppository q6 to 8h). I.M.: 1 / 4 mg/lb    body weight q6 to 8h, p.r.n.
HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS— As with outpatients, start with low doses and    increase dosage gradually. In severe behavior disorders, higher dosages (50    to 100 mg daily, and in older children, 200 mg daily or more) may be necessary.    There is little evidence that behavior improvement in severely disturbed mentally    retarded patients is further enhanced by doses beyond 500 mg per day. Maximum    I.M. Dosage: Children up to 5 years (or 50 lbs), not over 40 mg/day; 5 to 12    years (or 50 to 100 lbs), not over 75 mg/day except in unmanageable cases.
Nausea and Vomiting — Dosage and frequency of administration should    be adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms and response of the patient.    The duration of activity following intramuscular administration may last up    to 12 hours. Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary. Oral:    1 / 4 mg/lb body weight (e.g., 40 lb child— 10 mg q4 to 6h). Rectal: 1    / 2 mg/lb body weight q6 to 8h, p.r.n. (e.g., 20 to 30 lb child— half    of a 25 mg suppository q6 to 8h). I.M.: 1 / 4 mg/lb body weight q6 to 8h, p.r.n.    Maximum I.M. Dosage: Pediatric patients 6 months to 5 yrs. (or 50 lbs), not    over 40 mg/day; 5 to 12 yrs. (or 50 to 100 lbs), not over 75 mg/day except in    severe cases. DURING SURGERY— I.M.: 1 / 8 mg/lb body weight. Repeat in    1 / 2 hour if necessary and if no hypotension occurs. I.V.: 1 mg per fractional    injection at 2-minute intervals and not exceeding recommended I.M. dosage. Always    dilute to 1 mg/ mL, i.e., 1 mL (25 mg) mixed with 24 mL of saline.
Presurgical Apprehension — 1 / 4 mg/lb body weight, either orally    2 to 3 hours before operation, or I.M. 1 to 2 hours before.
Tetanus — I.M. or I.V.: 1 / 4 mg/lb body weight q6 to 8h. When    given I.V., dilute to at least 1 mg/mL and administer at rate of 1 mg per 2    minutes. In patients up to 50 lbs, do not exceed 40 mg daily; 50 to 100 lbs,    do not exceed 75 mg, except in severe cases.
Inject slowly, deep into upper outer quadrant of buttock.
Because of possible hypotensive effects, reserve parenteral administration    for bedfast patients or for acute ambulatory cases, and keep patient lying down    for at least 1 / 2 hour after injection. If irritation is a problem, dilute    Injection with saline or 2% procaine; mixing with other agents in the syringe    is not recommended. Subcutaneous injection is not advised. Avoid injecting undiluted    Thorazine (chlorpromazine) into vein. I.V. route is only for severe hiccups,    surgery and tetanus.
Because of the possibility of contact dermatitis, avoid getting solution on    hands or clothing. This solution should be protected from light. This is a clear,    colorless to pale yellow solution; a slight yellowish discoloration will not    alter potency. If markedly discolored, solution should be discarded. For information    on sulfite sensitivity, see the WARNINGS section of this labeling.
Note on Concentrate: When the Concentrate is to be used, add the desired    dosage of Concentrate to 60 mL (2 fl oz) or more of diluent just prior to administration.    This will insure palatability and stability. Vehicles suggested for dilution    are: tomato or fruit juice, milk, simple syrup, orange syrup, carbonated beverages,    coffee, tea or water. Semisolid foods (soups, puddings, etc.) may also be used.    The Concentrate is light sensitive; it should be protected from light and dispensed    in amber glass bottles. Refrigeration is not required.
