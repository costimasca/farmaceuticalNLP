Select patients for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with XALKORI based on the presence of ALK or ROS1 positivity in tumor specimens [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and Clinical Studies].
Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC is available at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiagnostics/ucm301431.htm.
An FDA-approved test for the detection of ROS1 rearrangements in NSCLC is not currently available. Refer to Section 14.2 for information on the tests used in the clinical study to identify patients with ROS1 rearrangements in NSCLC.
The recommended dose of XALKORI is 250 mg orally, twice daily until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the patient.
The recommended dose of XALKORI in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr)  < 30 mL/min] not requiring  dialysis is 250 mg orally, once daily [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
XALKORI may be taken with or without food. Swallow capsules whole. If a dose of XALKORI is missed, make up that dose unless the next dose is due within 6 hours. If vomiting occurs after taking a dose of XALKORI, take the next dose at the regular time.
Reduce dose as below, if 1 or more dose reductions are necessary due to adverse reactions of Grade 3 or 4 severity, as defined by  National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI  CTCAE) version 4.0:
Dose reduction guidelines are provided in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 1: XALKORI Dose Modification – Hematologic Toxicitiesa 
Table 2: XALKORI Dose Modification – Non-Hematologic Toxicities 
Monitor complete blood counts including differential white blood cell counts monthly and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing if Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities are observed, or if fever or infection occurs.
