Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain and the response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to oxycodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. This product is inappropriate even in high doses for severe or intractable pain.
TYLOX (oxycodone and acetaminophen capsules) are given orally. The usual adult dosage is one TYLOX (oxycodone and acetaminophen capsules)  capsule every 6 hours as needed for pain.
