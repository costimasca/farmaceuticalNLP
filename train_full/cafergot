Procedure: For the best results, dosage should start at the first sign    of an attack. Adults: Take 2 tablets at the start of attack; 1 additional tablet    every 1/2 hour, if needed for full relief (maximum 6 tablets per attack, 10    per week).
Maximum Adult Dosage: Total dose for any one attack should not exceed    6 tablets. Total weekly dosage should not exceed 10 tablets. Ergotamine tartrate    and caffeine tablets should not be used for chronic daily administration. In    carefully selected patients, with due consideration of maximum dosage recommendations,    administration of the drug at bedtime may be an appropriate short-term preventive    measure.
