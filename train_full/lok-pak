PARENTERAL DRUG PRODUCTS SHOULD BE INSPECTED VISUALLY FOR PARTICULATE MATTER AND DISCOLORATION PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION, WHENEVER SOLUTION AND CONTAINER PERMIT. SLIGHT DISCOLORATION DOES NOT ALTER POTENCY.
To prevent clot formation in a heparin lock set following its proper insertion, Heparin Lock Flush Solution is injected via the injection hub in a quantity sufficient to fill the entire set to the needle tip. This solution should be replaced each time the heparin lock is used. Aspirate before administering any solution via the lock in order to confirm patency and location of needle or catheter tip. If the drug to be administered is incompatible with heparin, the entire heparin lock set should be flushed with sterile water or normal saline before and after the medication is administered; following the second flush, Heparin Lock Flush Solution may be reinstilled into the set. The set manufacturerâ€™s instructions should be consulted for specifics concerning the heparin lock set in use at a given time.
Note: Since repeated injections of small doses of heparin can alter tests for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), a baseline value for APTT should be obtained prior to insertion of a heparin lock set.
Usually these dilute heparin solutions will maintain anticoagulation within the device for up to 4 hours.
Heparin Lock Flush Solution may also be used after each withdrawal of blood for laboratory tests. When heparin (or sodium chloride) would interfere with or alter the results of blood tests, the heparin solution should be cleared from the device by aspirating and discarding it before withdrawing the blood sample.
