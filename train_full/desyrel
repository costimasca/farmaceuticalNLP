The dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased gradually, noting    the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness    may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime    or a reduction of dosage. DESYREL (trazodone hydrochloride)  should be taken shortly after a meal or light    snack. Symptomatic relief may be seen during the first week, with optimal antidepressant    effects typically evident within two weeks. Twenty-five percent of those who    respond to DESYREL (trazodone hydrochloride)  require more than two weeks (up to four weeks) of drug administration.
An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dose may be    increased by 50 mg/day every three to four days. The maximum dose for outpatients    usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (ie, more    severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day    in divided doses.
Dosage during prolonged maintenance therapy should be kept at the lowest effective    level. Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually    reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.
Although there has been no systematic evaluation of the efficacy of DESYREL (trazodone hydrochloride)     beyond six weeks, it is generally recommended that a course of antidepressant    drug treatment should be continued for several months.
