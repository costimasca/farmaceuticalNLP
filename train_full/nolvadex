For patients with breast cancer, the recommended daily dose is 20-40 mg. Dosages    greater than 20 mg per day should be given in divided doses (morning and evening).  
In three single agent adjuvant studies in women, one 10 mg NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate)  tablet    was administered two (ECOG and NATO) or three (Toronto) times a day for two    years. In the NSABP B-14 adjuvant study in women with node-negative breast cancer,    one 10 mg NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate)  tablet was given twice a day for at least 5 years. Results    of the B-14 study suggest that continuation of therapy beyond five years does    not provide additional benefit (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). In the EBCTCG    1995 overview, the reduction in recurrence and mortality was greater in those    studies that used tamoxifen for about 5 years than in those that used tamoxifen    for a shorter period of therapy. There was no indication that doses greater    than 20 mg per day were more effective. Current data from clinical trials support    5 years of adjuvant NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate)  therapy for patients with breast cancer.
The recommended dose is NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate)  20 mg daily for 5 years.
The recommended dose is NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate)  20 mg daily for 5 years. There are no data    to support the use of NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate)  other than for 5 years (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Clinical    Studies - Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence in High Risk Women).
