ADULTS 
In rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, the more severe arthritides, and acute painful shoulder, the recommended starting dosage is 1500 mg given b.i.d. Some patients may be treated with 3000 mg given once per day (h.s.) In the elderly patient, a daily dosage of 2250 mg given as 750 mg t.i.d. may be efficacious and well tolerated. Dosage should be adjusted in accordance with the patients response. In patients with renal dysfunction, monitor salicylate levels and adjust dose accordingly. 
For mild to moderate pain or for antipyresis, the usual dosage is 2000 mg to 3000 mg daily in divided doses (b.i.d.). Based on patient response or salicylate blood levels, dosage may be adjusted to achieve optimum therapeutic effect. Salicylate blood levels should be in the range of 15 to 30 mg/ 100 mL for anti-inflammatory effect and 5 to 15 mg/ 100 mL for analgesia and antipyresis. 
Each 500 mg tablet or teaspoonful is equivalent in salicylate content to 10 g of aspirin; each 750 mg tablet, to 15 g of aspirin; and each 1000 mg tablet, to 20 g of aspirin. 
If the physician prefers, the recommended daily dosage may be administered on a t.i.d. schedule. 
As with other therapeutic agents, individual dosage adjustment is advisable, and a number of patients may require higher or lower dosages than those recommended. Certain patients require 2 to 3 weeks of therapy for optimal effect.
