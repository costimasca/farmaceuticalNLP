Prior to initiation of VEMLIDY, patients should be tested for HIV-1 infection. VEMLIDY alone should not be used in patients with HIV infection [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
It is recommended that serum creatinine, serum phosphorous, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed before initiating VEMLIDY and during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended dosage of VEMLIDY is 25 mg (one tablet) taken orally once daily with food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
No dosage adjustment of VEMLIDY is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. VEMLIDY is not recommended in patients with end stage renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL per minute) [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
No dosage adjustment of VEMLIDY is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). VEMLIDY is not recommended in patients with decompensated (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
