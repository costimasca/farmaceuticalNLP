A single vaccine dose is administered orally as two tablets: one tablet of Adenovirus Type 4 and one tablet of Adenovirus Type 7. (2)
The tablets should be swallowed whole, without chewing, to avoid releasing the virus in the upper respiratory tract. [See Mechanism of Action]
Postpone administration to individuals with vomiting and/or diarrhea because the effectiveness of the vaccine depends upon the multiplication of orally administered live adenovirus within the intestinal tract. [See Mechanism of Action]
