It is important that TUSSIONEX is measured with an accurate measuring device (see PRECAUTIONS,  and PATIENT INFORMATION).
A dosing spoon is provided with the 4 oz (115 mL) packaged product. One side of the spoon is for a 2.5 mL dose. The other side of the spoon is for a 5 mL dose. Fill to level the side of the spoon for the dose that has been prescribed. Do not overfill. Rinse with water after each use.
For prescriptions where a dosing spoon is not provided, a pharmacist can provide an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage.
Each 5 mL of Tussionex Pennkinetic Extended-Release Suspension contains hydrocodone polistirex equivalent to 10 mg hydrocodone bitartrate, and chlorpheniramine polistirex equivalent to 8 mg chlorpheniramine maleate. Shake well before using. Rinse the measuring device with water after each use.
5 mL every 12 hours; do not exceed 10 mL in 24 hours.
2.5 mL every 12 hours; do not exceed 5 mL in 24 hours.
This medicine is contraindicated in children under 6 years of age (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
