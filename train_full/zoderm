 Wash affected    areas once or twice a day, or as directed by your dermatologist. Wet skin and    liberally apply to areas to be cleansed, massage gently into skin for 10-20    seconds, working into a full lather, rinse thoroughly and pat dry. If excessive    drying occurs, it may be controlled by rinsing off hydrating wash sooner or    using less often.
