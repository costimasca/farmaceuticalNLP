The dosage of Dehydrated (dehydrated alcohol (dehydrated alcohol injection)  injection)  Alcohol Injection for therapeutic nerve or ganglion block varies from as little as 0.05 to 0.5 mL in trigeminal neuralgia to 0.5 to 1.0 mL per interspace for subarachnoid injections. Doses larger than 1.5 mL are seldom required. All injections should be made slowly and only after all steps have been taken to insure precise placement of the alcohol. A 1.0 mL tuberculin syringe is desirable to facilitate accurate measurement of the dose. Separate needles should be used for injection of successive interspaces or other sites. Since Dehydrated (dehydrated alcohol (dehydrated alcohol injection)  injection)  Alcohol Injection is hypobaric as compared to spinal fluid, proper positioning of the patient is essential to control localization of injections into the subarachnoid space.
When lesser concentrations of alcohol are used, larger volumes are usually injected. A dose of 2 mL of 45% alcohol has been used for injecting individual motor nerves, or from 1.5 to 4.0 mL for epidural injection in children with spastic cerebral palsy; 50 mL of 50% alcohol has been used for celiac plexus blockade.
The LD50 oral dose in rats is 13.7 g/kg.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.    See PRECAUTIONS.
