Subcutaneous administration only
VARIVAX is administered as an approximately 0.5-mL dose by subcutaneous injection into the outer aspect of the upper arm (deltoid  region) or the anterolateral thigh.
Do not administer this product intravascularly or intramuscularly.
If a second dose is administered, there should be a minimum interval of 3 months between doses [see Clinical Studies].
Two doses of vaccine, to be administered with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses [see Clinical Studies].
When reconstituting the vaccine, use only the sterile diluent supplied with VARIVAX. The sterile diluent does not contain preservatives or other anti-viral substances which might inactivate the vaccine virus.
Use a sterile syringe free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents for each reconstitution and injection of VARIVAX because these substances may inactivate the vaccine virus.
To reconstitute the vaccine, first withdraw the total volume of provided sterile diluent into a syringe. Inject all of the withdrawn diluent into the vial of lyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly. Withdraw the entire contents into the syringe and inject the total volume (approximately 0.5 mL) of reconstituted vaccine subcutaneously. VARIVAX, when reconstituted, is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if particulates are present or if it appears discolored.
To minimize loss of potency, administer VARIVAX immediately after reconstitution. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze reconstituted vaccine.
Do not combine VARIVAX with any other vaccine through reconstitution or mixing.
