The recommended initial dose of Ferriprox is 25 mg/kg, orally, three times per day for a total of 75 mg/kg/day. The maximum dose is 33 mg/kg, three times per day for a total of 99 mg/kg/day.
Dose adjustments up to 33 mg/kg, orally, three times per day should be tailored to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of body iron burden). The maximum recommended total daily dose is 99 mg/kg per day. The dose should be rounded by the prescriber to the nearest 250 mg (half-tablet).
Table 1a: Tablet requirement to achieve a 25 mg/kg (rounded to the nearest half-tablet) dose level for administration three times a day. 
Table 1b: Tablet requirement to achieve 33 mg/kg (rounded to the nearest half-tablet) dose level for administration three times a day. 
Monitor serum ferritin concentration every two to three months to assess the effects of Ferriprox on body iron stores. Dose adjustments should be tailored to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of body iron burden). If the serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 mcg/L, consider temporarily interrupting Ferriprox therapy.
Allow at least a 4-hour interval between Ferriprox and other medications or supplements containing polyvalent cations such as iron, aluminum, and zinc [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
