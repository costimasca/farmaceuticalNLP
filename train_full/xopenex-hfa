The recommended dosage of XOPENEX HFA for adults and children 4 years of age and older is 2 inhalations (90 mcg of levalbuterol free base) repeated every 4 to 6 hours; in some patients, 1 inhalation (45 mg of levalbuterol free base) every 4 hours may be sufficient. More frequent administration or a larger number of inhalations is not routinely recommended.
If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual response, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids.
For oral inhalation only
