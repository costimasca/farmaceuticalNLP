Table 1 Routine Prophylaxis Dosing 
The procedures below are provided as general guidelines for the reconstitution and administration of CINRYZE. Use either the Mix2VialÂ® transfer device or a commercially available double-ended needle.
Always work on a clean surface and wash your hands before performing the following procedures.
Reconstitution, product administration, and handling of the administration set and needles must be done with caution. Percutaneous puncture with a needle contaminated with blood can transmit infectious viruses including HIV (AIDS) and hepatitis. Obtain immediate medical attention if injury occurs. Place needles in a sharps container after single use. Discard all equipment, including any reconstituted CINRYZE in an appropriate container.
Two vials of reconstituted CINRYZE are combined for a single dose. Sterile Water for Injection, USP, is required and not supplied with CINRYZE.
One vial of reconstituted CINRYZE contains 5 mL of C1 esterase inhibitor at a concentration of 100 Units/mL. Reconstitute two vials of CINRYZE for one dose. Repeat steps 1 to 9 above using an additional package containing a Mix2Vial transfer device to reconstitute the second of two vials of CINRYZE. Do not reuse the Mix2Vial transfer device. CINRYZE must be administered at room temperature within 3 hours after reconstitution.

Two vials of reconstituted CINRYZE are combined for a single dose.
