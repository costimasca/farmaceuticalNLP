Table 1: Recommended Pediatric Dose of ANTHIM (weight-based dosing) 
There have been no studies of the safety or PK of ANTHIM conducted in the pediatric population. The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are derived from simulations using a population PK approach designed to match the observed adult exposure to ANTHIM at a 16 mg/kg dose [see Use in Specific Populations].
