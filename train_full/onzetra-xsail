The recommended dosage of ONZETRA is 22 mg of sumatriptan nasal powder (2 nosepieces), administered using the Xsail breath-powered delivery device. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking ONZETRA Xsail, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose of 22 mg may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum recommended dose that may be given in 24 hours is two doses of ONZETRA Xsail (44 mg/4 nosepieces) or one dose of ONZETRA Xsail and one dose of another sumatriptan product, separated by at least 2 hours. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30 day period has not been established.
The recommended dose of 22 mg is administered by using one 11 mg nosepiece in each nostril [see PATIENT INFORMATION]. For administration of ONZETRA Xsail, the patient removes the clear device cap from the reusable delivery device, then removes a disposable nosepiece from its foil pouch and clicks the nosepiece into the device body. The patient then fully presses and promptly releases the white piercing button on the device body to pierce the capsule inside the nosepiece. The white piercing button should only be pressed once and released prior to administration to each nostril. The nosepiece is then inserted into the nostril so that it makes a tight seal. Keeping the nosepiece in the nose, the device is rotated to place the mouthpiece into the mouth. The patient blows forcefully through the mouthpiece to deliver the sumatriptan powder into the nasal cavity. Vibration (e.g., a rattling noise) may occur, and indicates that the patient is blowing forcefully, as directed. Once the medication in the first nosepiece has been administered, the patient removes and discards the nosepiece. The same process must then be repeated using a second 11 mg nosepiece into the other nostril to administer the remainder of the total recommended 22 mg dose [see  PATIENT INFORMATION].
