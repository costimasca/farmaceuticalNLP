The dosage of Karbinal ER should be individualized based on the severity of the condition and the response of the patient. Start with lower doses and increase as needed and tolerated.
Administer Karbinal ER by the oral route only. Measure Karbinal ER with an accurate milliliter measuring device. A household teaspoon  is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage. A pharmacist can provide an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]
