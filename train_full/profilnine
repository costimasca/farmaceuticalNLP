Each vial of Profilnine is labeled with total units expressed as International Units (IU). According to the WHO International Standard, one unit approximates the activity in one mL of normal plasma.
A 1% increase in factor IX (0.01 units) per unit administered per kg body weight can be expected1. The amount of Profilnine required to establish hemostasis will vary with each patient and circumstance. Use the following formula and example as guides in determining the number of units to be administered:
Body weight (in kg) x Desired increase in Plasma Factor IX/ Plasma Factor IX (Percent) x 1 Units/kg = Number of Factor IX Units Required
Example: 50 kg X 25 (% increase) X 1 Units/kg = 1,250 Units of factor IX
Due to variability among patients and their clinical condition, monitor the factor IX level of each patient frequently during replacement therapy.
Table 2 below provides treatment guidelines for  hemorrhagic events and surgery in patients with factor IX deficiency.
Table 2: Treatment Guidelines 
Dosing requirements and frequency of dosing are calculated on the basis of an initial response of 1% FIX increase achieved per IU of FIX infused per kg body weight and an average half-life for FIX of 24 hours. If dosing studies reveal that a particular patient exhibits a lower response, monitor blood levels and adjust the dose accordingly.
