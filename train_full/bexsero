For intramuscular use only.
Administer two doses (0.5 mL each) of BEXSERO at least 1 month apart.
Shake the syringe immediately before use to form a homogeneous suspension. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is found.
Administer BEXSERO as a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.
Sufficient data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using BEXSERO and other meningococcal group B vaccines interchangeably to complete the vaccination series.
