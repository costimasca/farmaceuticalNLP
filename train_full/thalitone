Therapy should be initiated with the lowest possible dose,then titrated according    to individual patient response. A single dose given in the morning with food    is recommended; divided doses are unnecessary.
Therapy in most patients should be initiated with a single daily dose of 15    mg. If the response is insufficient after a suitable trial, the dosage may be    increased to 30 mg and then to a single daily dose of 45-50 mg. If additional    control is required,the addition of a second antihypertensive drug is recommended.    Increases in serum uric acid and decreases in serum potassium are dose-related    over the 15-50 mg/day range and beyond.
INITIATION: Adults, initially 30 to 60 mg daily or 60 mg on alternate    days. Some patients may require 90 to 120 mg at these intervals or up to 120    mg daily.Dosages above this level, however, do not usually produce a greater    response.
MAINTENANCE: Maintenance doses may often be lower than initial doses    and should be adjusted according to the individual patient. Effectiveness is    well sustained during continued use.
