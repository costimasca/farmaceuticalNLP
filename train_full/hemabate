An initial dose of 1 mL of HEMABATE Sterile Solution (containing the equivalent of 250 micrograms   of carboprost) is to be administered deep in the muscle with a tuberculin syringe. Subsequent doses of   250 micrograms should be administered at 1½ to 3½ hour intervals depending on uterine response.
An optional test dose of 100 micrograms (0.4 mL) may be administered initially. The dose may be   increased to 500 micrograms (2 mL) if uterine contractility is judged to be inadequate after several   doses of 250 micrograms (1 mL).
The total dose administered of carboprost tromethamine should not exceed 12 milligrams and   continuous administration of the drug for more than two days is not recommended.
An initial dose of 250 micrograms of HEMABATE Sterile Solution (1 mL of HEMABATE) is to be   given deep, intramuscularly. In clinical trials it was found that the majority of successful cases (73%)   responded to single injections. In some selected cases, however, multiple dosing at intervals of 15 to 90   minutes was carried out with successful outcome. The need for additional injections and the interval at   which these should be given can be determined only by the attending physicians as dictated by the   course of clinical events. The total dose of HEMABATE should not exceed 2 milligrams (8 doses).
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to   administration, whenever solution and container permit.
