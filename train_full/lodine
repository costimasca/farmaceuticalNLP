Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of etodolac capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use etodolac capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).
After observing the response to initial therapy with etodolac capsules, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
Dosage adjustment of etodolac capsules is generally not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Etodolac capsules should be used with caution in such patients, because, as with other NSAIDs, they may further decrease renal function in some patients with impaired renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ).
The recommended total daily dose of etodolac capsules for acute pain is up to 1000 mg, given as 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8 hours. Doses of etodolac greater than 1000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.
The recommended starting dose of etodolac capsules for the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis is: 300 mg b.i.d., t.i.d., or 400 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg b.i.d. A lower dose of 600 mg/day may suffice for long-term administration. Physicians should be aware that doses above 1000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.
In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with etodolac capsules is sometimes seen within one week of therapy, but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.
