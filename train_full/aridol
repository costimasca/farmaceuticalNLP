ARIDOL is a test kit containing the required capsules of dry powder mannitol   for oral inhalation in graduated doses with the supplied single patient use   inhaler necessary to perform one bronchial challenge test. The inhaler should   be discarded after use. 
Do not swallow ARIDOL (mannitol inhalation powder)  capsules. 
The airway response to bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL (mannitol inhalation powder)  is measured   using forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
Prior to bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL (mannitol inhalation powder) , standard spirometry should   be performed and the reproducibility of the resting FEV1 established.
An overview of the testing procedure can be found below. See the ARIDOL (mannitol inhalation powder)  bronchial   challenge test instructions for complete instructions on the dosing and spirometry    procedures.

A positive response is achieved when the patient experiences a 15% reduction   in FEV1 from (0 mg) baseline (or a 10% incremental reduction in FEV1   between consecutive doses). The test result is expressed as a PD15.
Patients with either a positive response to bronchial challenge testing with   ARIDOL (mannitol inhalation powder)  or significant respiratory symptoms should receive a standard dose of   a short acting inhaled beta-agonist and monitored until fully recovered to within   baseline.
