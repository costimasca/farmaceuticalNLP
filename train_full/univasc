The recommended initial dose of univasc® in patients not receiving diuretics is 7.5 mg, one hour prior to meals, once daily. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The antihypertensive effect of univasc® may diminish towards the end of the dosing interval. Blood pressure should, therefore, be measured just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory blood pressure control is obtained. If control is not adequate, increased dose or divided dosing can be tried. The recommended dose range is 7.5 to 30 mg daily, administered in one or two divided doses one hour before meals. Total daily doses above 60 mg a day have not been studied in hypertensive patients.
In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension may occasionally occur following the initial dose of univasc®. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for 2 to 3 days before therapy with univasc® is begun, to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (see WARNINGS). If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with univasc® alone, diuretic therapy may then be reinstituted. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 3.75 mg of univasc® should be used with medical supervision until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS).
For patients with a creatinine clearance  ≤ 40 mL/min/1.73 m², an initial dose of 3.75 mg once daily should be given cautiously. Doses may be titrated upward to a maximum daily dose of 15 mg.
