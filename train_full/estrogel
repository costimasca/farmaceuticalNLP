Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a  postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of  endometriosis may need a progestin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of estrogen-alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
