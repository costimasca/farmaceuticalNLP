a. Evaluation
If the patient has been evaluated to have pain caused by an active, irritated    trigger point then proceed to Step b.
b. Spraying
c. Stretching
Passively stretch the muscle during spray application. Gradually increase the    force with successive sweeps. As the muscle relaxes, smoothly take up the slack    by establishing a new stretch length. It is necessary to reach the full normal    length of the muscle to completely inactivate the trigger point and relieve    the pain. Rewarm the muscle. If necessary, repeat the procedure. Apply moist    heat for 10 to 15 minutes following treatment. For lasting benefit, eliminate    any factors that perpetuate the trigger mechanism.
