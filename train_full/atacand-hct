The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. ATACAND can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg. Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect.
Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily.
Use in Renal Impairment: Dosing recommendations for ATACAND HCT in patients with creatinine clearance  <  30 mg/min cannot be provided (see Special Populations, Renal Insufficiency).
Use in moderate to severe Hepatic Impairment: ATACAND HCT is not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given (see Special Populations, Hepatic Insufficiency).
The combination may be substituted for the titrated components.
A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily can expect an incremental effect from ATACAND HCT 16-12.5 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from ATACAND HCT 16-12.5 mg and serum potassium may improve.
A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 32 mg of ATACAND can expect incremental blood pressure effects from ATACAND HCT 32-12.5 mg and then 32-25 mg. The maximal antihypertensive effect of any dose of ATACAND HCT can be expected within 4 weeks of initiating that dose.
ATACAND HCT may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.
ATACAND HCT may be administered with or without food.
