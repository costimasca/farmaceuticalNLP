ERYGELÂ® (erythromycin topical gel)  Topical Gel should be applied sparingly as a thin film to affected   area(s) once or twice a day after the skin is thoroughly cleansed and patted   dry. If there has been no improvement after 6 to 8 weeks, or if the condition   becomes worse, treatment should be discontinued, and the physician should be   reconsulted. Spread the medication lightly rather than rubbing it in. There   are no data directly comparing the safety and efficacy of b.i.d. versus q.d.   dosing.
