Actonel should be taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink   of the day other than water. Actonel should not be taken at the same time as   other medications, including calcium.
To facilitate delivery to the stomach, Actonel should be swallowed while the   patient is in an upright position and with a full glass of plain water (6 to   8 oz). Patients should not lie down for 30 minutes after taking the medication   (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Actonel is not recommended for use   in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  < 30 mL/min).   No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with a creatinine clearance  ≥ 30   mL/min or in the elderly.
The recommended total (diet and otherwise) daily calcium intake in postmenopausal   women is 1200 mg of elemental calcium. If patients need calcium in excess of   that provided by Actonel with Calcium (risedronate sodium with calcium carbonate) , this should be taken with food at a separate   time of day.
Patients should receive additional vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate   (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Co-administration of calcium tablets   and calcium-, aluminum-, and magnesium-containing medications may interfere   with the absorption of Actonel (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).
Actonel with Calcium (risedronate sodium with calcium carbonate)  is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal   impairment (creatinine clearance  < 30 mL/min). No dosage adjustment is necessary   in patients with a creatinine clearance  ≥  30 mL/min or in the elderly.
