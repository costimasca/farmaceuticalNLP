The usual recommended starting dose of TEVETEN速 is 600 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-depleted (see WARNINGS, Hypotension in Volume- and/or Salt-Depleted Patients). TEVETEN速 can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. There is limited experience with doses beyond 800 mg/day.
If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using once-daily dosing is inadequate, a twicea- day regimen at the same total daily dose or an increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response. Achievement of maximum blood pressure reduction in most patients may take 2 to 3 weeks.
TEVETEN速 may be used in combination with other antihypertensive agents such as thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers if additional blood-pressure-lowering effect is required. Discontinuation of treatment with eprosartan does not lead to a rapid rebound increase in blood pressure.
No initial dosing adjustment is generally necessary for elderly or hepatically impaired patients or those with renal impairment. No initial dosing adjustment is generally necessary in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, with maximum dose not exceeding 600 mg daily. TEVETEN速 may be taken with or without food.
