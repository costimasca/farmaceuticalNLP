Each dose of tobramycin inhalation solution is administered by oral inhalation using only the co-packaged PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer (Model No. 022B81-T) included in the KITABIS PAK, along with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor (Model No. 5650D).
Tobramycin inhalation solution is not for subcutaneous, intravenous or intrathecal administration.
Prior to administration, read the Patient Information/Instructions for Use for KITABIS PAK for detailed information on how to use KITABIS PAK and follow the manufacturer's instructions for use and care of the DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor.
The entire tobramycin inhalation solution treatment should take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Continue treatment until all the tobramycin inhalation solution has been delivered, and there is no longer any mist being produced.
Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be diluted or mixed with other drugs including dornase alfa in the nebulizer. Instruct patients on multiple therapies to take their medications prior to inhaling the tobramycin inhalation solution, or as directed by their physician.
Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days.
