DO NOT SWALLOW ARCAPTA CAPSULES
FOR USE WITH NEOHALER DEVICE ONLY
FOR ORAL INHALATION ONLY

The recommended dosage of ARCAPTA NEOHALER is the once-daily inhalation of the contents of one 75 mcg ARCAPTA capsule using the NEOHALER inhaler.
ARCAPTA NEOHALER should be administered once daily every day at the same time of the day by the orally inhaled route only. If a dose is missed, the next dose should be taken as soon as it is remembered. Do not use ARCAPTA NEOHALER more than one time every 24 hours.
ARCAPTA capsules must always be stored in the blister, and only removed IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USE. No dosage adjustment is required for geriatric patients, patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, or renally impaired patients.
No data are available for subjects with severe hepatic impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
