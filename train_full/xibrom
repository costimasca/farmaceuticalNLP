One drop of Xibrom ophthalmic solution should be applied to the affected eye two times daily beginning 24 hours after cataract surgery and continuing through the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period.
Xibrom ophthalmic solution may be administered in conjunction with other topical ophthalmic medications such as alpha-agonists, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, cycloplegics, and mydriatics. Drops should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.
