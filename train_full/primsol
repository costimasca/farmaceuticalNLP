The recommended dose for pediatric patients with acute  otitis media is 10 mg/kg trimethoprim per 24 hours, given in divided doses every 12 hours for 10 days. The following table is a guideline for the attainment of this dosage:
Pediatric patients 6 months of age or older 
The usual oral adult dosage is 100 mg (10 mL) every 12 hours or 200 mg (20 mL) every 24 hours, each for 10 days.
The use of trimethoprim in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 15 mL/min is not recommended. Patients with a creatinine clearance of 15 to 30 mL/min should receive half the dose recommended for patients of the same age with normal renal function.
