EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) , like rapid-acting insulin analogs, has a more rapid onset of glucose-lowering   activity compared to subcutaneously injected regular human insulin. EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])    has a duration of glucose-lowering activity comparable to subcutaneously injected   regular human insulin and longer than rapid-acting insulin. EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  doses should   be administered immediately prior to meals (no more than 10 minutes prior to   each meal).
In patients with type 1 diabetes, EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  should be used in regimens that include   a longer-acting insulin. For patients with type 2 diabetes, EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  may be used   as monotherapy or in combination with oral agents or longer-acting insulin.
Because of the effect of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  on pulmonary function, all patients should    have pulmonary function assessed prior to initiating therapy with EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) . Periodic    monitoring of pulmonary function is recommended for patients being treated with    EXUBERA (see PRECAUTIONS, Pulmonary Function).
EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  is intended for administration by inhalation and must only be administered   using the EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) ® Inhaler. Refer to the EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  Medication Guide for a   description of the EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) ® Inhaler and for instructions on how to use the   inhaler.
The initial dosage of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  should be individualized and determined based   on the physician's advice in accordance with the needs of the patient. Recommended   initial pre-meal doses are based on clinical trials in which patients were requested   to eat three meals per day. Initial pre-meal doses may be calculated using the   following formula: [Body weight (kg) X 0.05 mg/kg = pre-meal dose (mg)] rounded   down to the nearest whole milligram number (e.g., 3.7 mg rounded down to 3 mg).
Approximate guidelines for initial, pre-meal EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  doses, based on patient   body weight, are indicated in Table 7:

A 1 mg blister of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 3   IU of subcutaneously injected regular human insulin. A 3 mg blister of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])    inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 8 IU of subcutaneously injected   regular human insulin. Table 8provides the approximate IU dose of regular subcutaneous    human insulin for EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  inhaled insulin doses from 1 mg to 6 mg.

Patients should combine 1 mg and 3 mg blisters so that the least number of    blisters per dose are taken (e.g., a 4 mg dose should be administered as one    1 mg blister and one 3 mg blister). Consecutive inhalation of three 1 mg unit    dose blisters results in significantly greater insulinexposure than inhalation    of one 3 mg unit dose blister. Therefore, three 1 mg doses should notbe substituted    for one 3 mg dose (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,    Pharmacokinetics).When a patient is stabilized on a dosing regimen that    includes 3 mg blisters, and the 3 mg blisters become temporarily unavailable,    the patient can temporarily substitute two 1 mg blisters for one 3 mg blister.    Blood glucose should be monitored closely.
As with all insulins, additional factors that should be taken into consideration   when determining the EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  starting dose include, but are not limited to,   patient's current glycemic control, previous response to insulin, duration of   diabetes, and dietary and exercise habits.
After initiating EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  therapy, as with other glucose-lowering agents, dose   adjustment may be required based on the patient's need (e.g., blood glucose    concentrations, meal size and nutrient composition, time of day and recent or   anticipated exercise). Each patient should be titrated to their optimal dosage   based on blood glucose monitoring results.
As for all insulins, the time course of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  action may vary in different   individuals or at different times in the same individual.
EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin])  may be used during intercurrent respiratory illness (e.g., bronchitis,   upper respiratory tract infection, rhinitis). Close monitoring of blood glucose   concentrations and dose adjustment may be required on an individual basis. Inhaled   medicinal products (e.g. bronchodilators) should be administered prior to administration   of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) .
