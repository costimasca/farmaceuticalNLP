Administer VERAMYST Nasal Spray by the intranasal route only. Prime VERAMYST Nasal Spray before using for the first time by shaking the contents well and releasing 6 sprays into the air away from the face. When VERAMYST Nasal Spray has not been used for more than 30 days or if the cap has been left off the bottle for 5 days or longer, prime the pump again until a fine mist appears. Shake VERAMYST Nasal Spray well before each use.
Titrate an individual patient to the minimum effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.
The recommended starting dosage is 110 mcg once daily administered as 2 sprays (27.5 mcg/spray) in each nostril. When the maximum benefit has been achieved and symptoms have been controlled, reducing the dosage to 55 mcg (1 spray in each nostril) once daily may be effective in maintaining control of allergic rhinitis symptoms.
The recommended starting dosage in children is 55 mcg once daily administered as 1 spray (27.5 mcg/spray) in each nostril. Children not adequately responding to 55 mcg may use 110 mcg (2 sprays in each nostril) once daily. Once symptoms have been controlled, dosage reduction to 55 mcg once daily is recommended.
