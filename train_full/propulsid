5 ml (1 teaspoon) suspension = 5 mg.
Adults
Initiate therapy with one 10 mg tablet of cisapride or 10 ml of the suspension 4 times daily at least 15 minutes before meals and at bedtime. In some patients the dosage will need to be increased to 20 mg, given as above, to obtain a satisfactory result.
Cisapride should be discontinued if relief of nocturnal heartburn does not occur. The minimum effective dose should be used. Recommended doses of cisapride should not be exceeded.
It is recommended that the daily dose be halved in patients with hepatic insufficiency.
In elderly patients, steady-state plasma levels are generally higher due to a moderate prolongation of the elimination half-life. Therapeutic doses, however, are similar to those used in younger adults.
