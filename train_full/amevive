The recommended dose of AMEVIVE® is 15 mg intramuscularly once weekly for 12 weeks. The CD4+ T lymphocyte counts should be measured before initiating dosing.
AMEVIVE® therapy should not be initiated in patients who have CD4+ T lymphocyte   counts below normal. The CD4+ T lymphocyte counts of patients receiving AMEVIVE®   should be monitored every two weeks throughout the course of the 12-week dosing   regimen. If CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are below 250 cells/µL, AMEVIVE®   dosing should be withheld and weekly monitoring instituted. AMEVIVE® should   be discontinued if the counts remain below 250 cells/µL for one month   [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
An additional 12-week course may be initiated if at least 12-weeks have passed since the previous treatment course and the CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are normal.
