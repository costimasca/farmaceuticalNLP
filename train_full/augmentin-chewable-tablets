Pediatric Patients: Based on the amoxicillin component, AUGMENTIN should   be dosed as follows:
 Neonates and infants aged  < 12 weeks (3 months): Due to incompletely   developed renal function affecting elimination of amoxicillin in this age group,   the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN is 30 mg/kg/day divided q12h, based on the   amoxicillin component. Clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group.   Experience with the 200 mg/5 mL formulation in this age group is limited and,   thus, use of the 125 mg/5 mL oral suspension is recommended.
Patients aged 12 weeks (3 months) and older  
Pediatric Patients Weighing 40 kg and More: Should be dosed according   to the following adult recommendations: The usual adult dose is one 500-mg tablet   of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours.   For more severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose   should be one 875-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 500-mg tablet   of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours. Among adults treated with 875 mg every 12 hours,   significantly fewer experienced severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea   versus adults treated with 500 mg every 8 hours. For detailed adult dosage recommendations,   please see complete prescribing information for tablets of AUGMENTIN.
Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic function   monitored at regular intervals. (See WARNINGS.)
 Adults: Adults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the   125 mg/5 mL or 250 mg/5 mL suspension in place of the 500-mg tablet. The 200   mg/5 mL suspension or the 400 mg/5 mL suspension may be used in place of the   875-mg tablet. See dosage recommendations above for children weighing 40 kg   or more.
The 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250-mg chewable tablet do not contain   the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt). The 250-mg tablet   of AUGMENTIN contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid, whereas the 250-mg chewable   tablet contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid. Therefore, the 250-mg tablet of   AUGMENTIN and the 250-mg chewable tablet should not be substituted for   each other, as they are not interchangeable. 
Due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the 250-mg   tablet of AUGMENTIN (250/125) versus the 250-mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN   (250/62.5), the 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should not be used until the child   weighs at least 40 kg and more. 
Directions for Mixing Oral Suspension: Prepare a suspension at time   of dispensing as follows: Tap bottle until all the powder flows freely. Add   approximately 2/3 of the total amount of water for reconstitution (see table   below) and shake vigorously to suspend powder. Add remainder of the water and   again shake vigorously.
AUGMENTIN 125 mg/5 mL Suspension  
Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 125 mg amoxicillin and 31.25 mg of clavulanic   acid as the potassium salt.
AUGMENTIN 200 mg/5 mL Suspension  
Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 200 mg amoxicillin and 28.5 mg of clavulanic   acid as the potassium salt.
AUGMENTIN 250 mg/5 mL Suspension  
Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 250 mg amoxicillin and 62.5 mg of clavulanic   acid as the potassium salt.
AUGMENTIN 400 mg/5 mL Suspension  
Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 400 mg amoxicillin and 57.0 mg of clavulanic   acid as the potassium salt.
Note: SHAKE ORAL SUSPENSION WELL BEFORE USING. 
Reconstituted suspension must be stored under refrigeration and discarded   after 10 days. 
Administration: AUGMENTIN may be taken without regard to meals; however,   absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when AUGMENTIN is administered   at the start of a meal. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance,   AUGMENTIN should be taken at the start of a meal.
