OXYCONTIN should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain.
The starting dosage for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Adult patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
If switching from other oral oxycodone formulations to OXYCONTIN, administer one half of the patient's total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCONTIN every 12 hours
There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCONTIN defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours.
It is safer to underestimate a patientâ€™s 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioids.
Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.
If switching from transdermal fentanyl patch to OXYCONTIN, ensure that the patch has been removed for at least 18 hours prior to starting OXYCONTIN. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion.
The following dosing information is for use only in pediatric patients 11 years and older already receiving and tolerating opioids for at least five consecutive days. For the two days immediately preceding dosing with OXYCONTIN, patients must be taking a minimum of 20 mg per day of oxycodone or its equivalent. OXYCONTIN is not appropriate for use in pediatric patients requiring less than a 20 mg total daily dose. Table 1, based on clinical trial experience, displays the conversion factor when switching pediatric patients 11 years and older (under the conditions described above) from opioids to OXYCONTIN.
Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated.
Although tables of oral and parenteral equivalents are readily available, there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and formulations. As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patientâ€™s 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements and manage an adverse reaction.
Consider the following when using the information in Table 1.
Table 1: Conversion Factors When Switching Pediatric Patients 11 Years and Older to OXYCONTIN 
Step #1: To calculate the estimated total OXYCONTIN daily dose using Table 1:
Step #2: If rounding is necessary, always round the dosage down to the nearest OXYCONTIN tablet strength available and initiate OXYCONTIN therapy with that dose. If the calculated OXYCONTIN total daily dosage is less than 20 mg, there is no safe strength for conversion and do not initiate OXYCONTIN.
Example conversion from a single opioid (e.g., hydrocodone) to OXYCONTIN: Using the conversion factor of 0.9 for oral hydrocodone in Table 1, a total daily hydrocodone dosage of 50 mg is converted to 45 mg of oxycodone per day or 22.5 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours. After rounding down to the nearest strength available, the recommended OXYCONTIN starting dosage is 20 mg every 12 hours.
Step #3: Close observation and titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal or for signs of over-sedation/toxicity after converting patients to OXYCONTIN. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for important instructions on titration and maintenance of therapy.
There is limited experience with conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN in pediatric patients 11 years and older. If switching from transdermal fentanyl patch to OXYCONTIN, ensure that the patch has been removed for at least 18 hours prior to starting OXYCONTIN. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN.
If using asymmetric dosing, instruct patients to take the higher dose in the morning and the lower dose in the evening
Individually titrate OXYCONTIN to a dosage that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXYCONTIN to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics.
Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage increase of OXYCONTIN or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the OXYCONTIN dosage. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCONTIN dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.
There are no well-controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline for pediatric patients 11 years and older, the total daily oxycodone dosage usually can be increased by 25% of the current total daily dosage. As a guideline for adults, the total daily oxycodone dosage usually can be increased by 25% to 50% of the current total daily dosage, each time an increase is clinically indicated.
If the patient is currently taking a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and the decision is made to begin OXYCONTIN, start with 1/3 to ½ the recommended starting dosage of OXYCONTIN and monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS].
For geriatric patients who are debilitated and not opioid tolerant, start dosing patients at 1/3 to ½ the recommended starting dosage and titrate the dosage cautiously [see Use in Specific Populations].
For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 1/3 to ½ the recommended starting dosage followed by careful dosage titration [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
When the patient no longer requires therapy with OXYCONTIN, gradually titrate the dosage downward to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCONTIN.
