Table 1: Dosing Recommendation Based on Blood Count 
Patients must be able to follow directions regarding drug administration and their monitoring and care. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels may be used to evaluate the efficacy of DROXIA in clinical use. Obtain HbF levels every three to four months. Monitor for an increase in HbF of at least two-fold over the baseline value.
DROXIA causes macrocytosis, which may mask the incidental development of folic acid deficiency. Prophylactic administration of folic acid is recommended.
DROXIA is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see REFERENCES].
Reduce the dose of DROXIA by 50% in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min or with end-stage renal disease  (ESRD) [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Creatinine clearance values were obtained using 24-hour urine collections.
 
Monitor the hematologic parameters closely in these patients.
