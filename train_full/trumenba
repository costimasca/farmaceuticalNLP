For intramuscular use only.
Three-dose schedule: Administer a dose (0.5 mL) at 0, 1-2, and 6 months.
Two-dose schedule: Administer a dose (0.5 mL) at 0 and 6 months.
The choice of dosing schedule may depend on the risk of exposure and the patient's susceptibility to meningococcal serogroup B disease.
Shake syringe vigorously to ensure that a homogenous white suspension of Trumenba is obtained. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be re-suspended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is found.
Inject each 0.5 mL dose intramuscularly, using a sterile needle attached to the supplied prefilled syringe. The preferred site for injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not mix Trumenba with any other vaccine in the same syringe.
Sufficient data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using Trumenba and other meningococcal group B vaccines interchangeably to complete the vaccination series.
