The solution should be used according to the standard technique employed by    the operating surgeon. Use an administration set with an air-inlet in the plastic    spike since the bottle does not contain a separate airway tube. Follow the directions    for the particular administration set to be used. Insert the spike aseptically    into the bottle through the center target area of the rubber stopper. Allow    the fluid to flow to remove air from the tubing before intraocular irrigation    begins. If a second bottle is necessary to complete the surgical procedure,    ensure that the vacuum is vented from the second bottle BEFORE attachment to    the administration set.
DIRECTIONS: Use Aseptic Technique

CAUTION: Reconstituted BSS PLUS Solution must be used within six hours    of mixing. Discard any solution which has aged beyond that time. Never use the    same bottle of BSS PLUS Solution on more than one patient.
If preferred, the contents of the BSS PLUS Part II component may be aspirated    with an 18-gauge cannula attached to a 10 mL syringe and then transferred into    the Part I bottle.
