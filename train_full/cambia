Administer one packet (50 mg) of CAMBIA for the acute treatment of migraine. Empty the contents of one packet into a cup containing 1 to 2 ounces or 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 mL) of water, mix well and drink immediately.
Do not use liquids other than water.
Taking CAMBIA with food may cause a reduction in effectiveness compared to taking CAMBIA on an empty stomach [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. The safety and effectiveness of a second dose have not been established.
Different formulations of oral diclofenac (e.g., CAMBIA, diclofenac sodium enteric-coated tablets, diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, or diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets) may not be bioequivalent even if the milligram strength is the same. Therefore, it is not possible to convert dosing from any other formulation of diclofenac to CAMBIA.
