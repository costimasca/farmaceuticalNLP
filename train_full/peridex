Peridex therapy should be initiated directly following a dental prophylaxis. Patients using Peridex should be reevaluated and given a thorough prophylaxis at intervals no longer than six months. Recommended use is twice daily oral rinsing for 30 seconds, morning and evening after toothbrushing. Usual dosage is 15ml (marked in cap) of undiluted Peridex. Patients should be instructed to not rinse with water or other mouthwashes, brush teeth or eat immediately after using Peridex. Peridex is not intended for ingestion and should be expectorated after rinsing.
