Narcolepsy seldom occurs in children under 12 years of age; however, when it does, Evekeo may be used. The suggested initial dose for patients aged 6 to 12 is 5 mg daily; daily dose may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response obtained. In patients 12 years of age and older, start with 10 mg daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 10 mg at weekly intervals until 50 optimal response is obtained. If bothersome adverse reactions appear (e.g., insomnia or anorexia) dosage should be reduced. Give the first dose on awakening; additional doses (5 or 10 mg) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.
Not recommended for children under 3 years of age.

In children 6 years of age or older, start with 5 mg once or twice daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained. Only in rare cases will it be necessary to exceed a total of 40 milligrams per day.
With tablets give first dose on awakening; additional doses (1 to 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.
