 Each Vitrasert Implant contains a minimum of 4.5 mg of ganciclovir, and is    designed to release the drug over a 5 to 8 month period of time. Following depletion    of ganciclovir from the Vitrasert (ganciclovir)  Implant, as evidenced by progression of retinitis,    the Vitrasert (ganciclovir)  Implant may be removed and replaced.
Caution should be exercised in handling of the Vitrasert (ganciclovir)  Implant in order to   avoid damage to the polymer coating on the implant, which may result in an increased   rate of drug release from the implant. Thus, the Vitrasert (ganciclovir)  Implant should be   handled only by the suture tab. Aseptic technique should be maintained at all   times prior to and during the surgical implantation procedure.
Because the Vitrasert Implant contains ganciclovir, which shares some of the   properties of anti-tumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration   should be given to handling and disposal of the Vitrasert (ganciclovir)  Implant according   to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs.
