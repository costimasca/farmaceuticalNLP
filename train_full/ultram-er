ULTRAM ER should not be used in patients with:
ULTRAM ER must be swallowed whole and must not be chewed, crushed, or split (see WARNINGS, Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids and Drug Abuse And Addiction).
For patients not currently treated with tramadol immediate-release (IR) products, ULTRAM ER should be initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily and titrated up as necessary by 100-mg increments every five days to relief of pain and depending upon tolerability. ULTRAM ER should not be administered at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day.
For patients maintained on tramadol IR products, calculate the 24-hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of ULTRAM ER rounded down to the next lowest 100 mg increment. The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need. Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with ULTRAM ER, some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to ULTRAM ER. ULTRAM ER should not be administered at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day. The concomitant use of ULTRAM ER with other tramadol products is not recommended (see WARNINGS).
Good pain management practice dictates that the dose be individualized according to patient need using the lowest beneficial dose. Start at the lowest possible dose and titrate upward as tolerated to achieve an adequate effect. Clinical studies of ULTRAM ER have not demonstrated a clinical benefit at a total daily dose exceeding 300 mg.
In general, dosing of an elderly patient (over 65 years of age) should be initiated cautiously, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. ULTRAM ER should be administered with even greater caution in patients over 75 years, due to the greater frequency of adverse events seen in this population.
