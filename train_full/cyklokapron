Immediately before tooth extraction in patients with hemophilia, administer 10 mg per kg body weight of CYKLOKAPRON intravenously together with replacement therapy (see PRECAUTIONS). Following tooth extraction, intravenous therapy, at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight three to four times daily, may be used for 2 to 8 days.
Note: For patients with moderate to severe impaired renal function, the following dosages are recommended:
 
For intravenous infusion, CYKLOKAPRON Injection may be mixed with most solutions for infusion such as electrolyte solutions, carbohydrate solutions, amino acid solutions, and Dextran solutions. Heparin may be added to CYKLOKAPRON Injection. CYKLOKAPRON Injection should NOT be mixed with blood. The drug is a synthetic amino acid, and should NOT be mixed with solutions containing penicillin.
Discard CYKLOKAPRON vial or ampule and any remaining portion in the vial/ampule after single use.
The diluted mixture may be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature prior to patient administration.
