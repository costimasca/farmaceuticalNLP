The dosage will vary depending upon the individual, the condition being treated, and its severity. The total daily oral dose may be administered singly or in divided (three or four) doses.
Male hypogonadism: For complete replacement in the hypogonadal male,    a daily dose of 5 to 20 mg will suffice in the majority of patients. It is usually    preferable to begin treatment with full therapeutic doses which are later adjusted    to individual requirements. Priapism is indicative of excessive dosage and is    indication for temporary withdrawal of the drug.
Delayed puberty: Dosage should be carefully titrated utilizing a low    dose, appropriate skeletal monitoring, and by limiting the duration of therapy    to four to six months.
Inoperable carcinoma of the breast in the female: The recommended total    daily dose for palliative therapy in advanced inoperable carcinoma of the breast    is 10 to 40 mg. Because of its short action, fluoxymesterone should be administered    to patients in divided, rather than single, daily doses to ensure more stable    blood levels. In general, it appears necessary to continue therapy for at least    one month for a satisfactory subjective response, and for two to three months    for an objective response.
