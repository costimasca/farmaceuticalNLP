The recommended starting dose for patients whose HbA1c is less than 8% is 0.5 mg orally before each meal. For patients whose HbA1c is 8% or greater the starting dose is 1 or 2 mg orally before each meal.
The recommended dose range is 0.5 mg to 4 mg before meals, with a maximum daily dose of 16 mg. The patient’s dose should be doubled up to 4 mg with each meal until satisfactory glycemic control is achieved. At least one week should elapse to assess response after each dose adjustment.
Instruct patients to take PRANDIN within 30 minutes before meals. PRANDIN may be dosed 2, 3, or 4 times a day in response to changes in the patient’s meal pattern.
In patients who skip meals, instruct patients to skip the scheduled dose of PRANDIN to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. In patients who experience hypoglycemia, the dose of PRANDIN should be reduced [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
In patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl = 20 – 40 mL/min) initiate PRANDIN 0.5 mg orally before each meal. Gradually titrate the dose, if needed to achieve glycemic control.
Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inducers [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Concomitant use with gemfibrozil is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].
Avoid concomitant use of PRANDIN with clopidogrel. If concomitant use can not be avoided, initiate PRANDIN at 0.5 mg before each meal and do not exceed a total daily dose of 4 mg [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Do not exceed a total daily dose of 6 mg of PRANDIN in patients receiving cyclosporine [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
