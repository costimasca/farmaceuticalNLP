BYDUREON (2 mg per dose) should be administered once every 7 days (weekly). The dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals.
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as noticed, provided the next regularly scheduled dose is due at least 3 days later. Thereafter, patients can resume their usual dosing schedule of once every 7 days (weekly).
If a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not administer the missed dose and instead resume BYDUREON with the next regularly scheduled dose.
The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered 3 or more days before.
BYDUREON must be injected immediately after the dose is prepared. BYDUREON is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm region. Advise patients to use a different injection site each week when injecting in the same region. BYDUREON must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. BYDUREON is intended for patient self-administration.
Prior to initiation of BYDUREON, patients should be trained by their healthcare professional. For the BYDUREON Pen, study data demonstrated that training reduced the risk of administration errors such as inadequate mixing or incomplete dosing. Patients using the BYDUREON Pen should be trained on proper mixing and injection technique to ensure the product is adequately mixed and a full dose is delivered. Refer to the accompanying Instructions for Use for complete administration instructions with illustrations. The instructions can also be found at www.bydureon.com.
Prior treatment with BYETTA is not required when initiating BYDUREON therapy. If the decision is made to start BYDUREON in an appropriate patient already taking BYETTA, BYETTA should be discontinued. Patients changing from BYETTA to BYDUREON may experience transient (approximately 2 weeks) elevations in blood glucose concentrations.
