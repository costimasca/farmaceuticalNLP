These solutions are for intravenous use only.
Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight,    clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory    determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood    glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during    prolonged parenteral therapy.
Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement    fluid requirements for each patient.
If the serum potassium level is greater than 2.5 mEq/liter, potassium chloride    should be given at a rate not to exceed 10 mEq/hour in a concentration less    than 30 mEq/liter. The total 24-hour dose should not exceed 200 mEq.
If urgent treatment is indicated (serum potassium level less than 2.0 mEq/liter    with electrocardiographic changes or paralysis), potassium chloride may be infused    at a rate of 40 mEq/hour. As much as 400 mEq may be administered in a 24-hour    period while monitoring blood electrolyte concentrations carefully.
Dextrose may be administered to normal individuals at a rate of 0.5 g/kg/hour    without producing glycosuria. At the maximum infusion rate of 0.8 g/kg/hour,    approximately 95% of the dextrose is retained. Pediatric Dosage and Administration.    There is no specific pediatric dose. The dose is dependent on weight, clinical    condition and laboratory results. See WARNINGS    and PRECAUTIONS.
Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing    additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
