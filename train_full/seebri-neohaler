For oral inhalation only. Do not swallow SEEBRI capsules, as the intended effects on the lungs will not be obtained. SEEBRI capsules should only be used with the NEOHALER device [see OVERDOSAGE].

Store SEEBRI capsules in the blister, and only remove IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USE with the NEOHALER device.
