VERDESO Foam is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
A thin layer of VERDESO Foam should be applied to the affected area(s) twice daily. Shake the can before use. VERDESO Foam should be dispensed by inverting the can (upright actuation will cause loss of the propellant which may affect product delivery). Dispense the smallest amount of foam necessary to adequately cover the affected area(s) with a thin layer.
The medication should not be dispensed directly on the face. Dispense in hands and gently massage into affected areas of the face until the medication disappears. For areas other than the face, the medication may be dispensed directly onto the affected area. Take care to avoid contact with the eyes or other mucous membranes.
Patients should dispense the smallest amount of foam necessary to adequately cover the affected area with a thin layer. Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 4 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary. The safety and efficacy of VERDESO Foam has not been established beyond 4 weeks of use. Treatment should not exceed 4 consecutive weeks.
Unless directed by a physician, VERDESO Foam should not be used with occlusive dressings.
