FIRAZYR should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The drug solution should be clear and colorless. Do not administer if the product contains particulates or is discolored.
Attach the provided 25 gauge needle to the syringe hub and screw on securely. Do not use a different needle. Disinfect the injection site and administer FIRAZYR by subcutaneous injection over at least 30 seconds.
Patients may self-administer FIRAZYR upon recognition of symptoms of an HAE attack after training under the guidance of a healthcare professional [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
