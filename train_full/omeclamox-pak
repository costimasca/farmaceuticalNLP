The recommended adult oral regimen is omeprazole delayed-release capsules 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg plus amoxicillin 1000 mg, each given twice daily, for 10 days, in the morning and evening before eating a meal. Inform patients that omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin should not be crushed or chewed, and should be swallowed whole.
In patients with an ulcer present at the time of initiation of therapy, an additional 18 days of omeprazole 20 mg once daily is recommended for ulcer healing and symptom relief.
