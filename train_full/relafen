Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of RELAFEN (nabumetone)  and other treatment    options before deciding to use RELAFEN (nabumetone) . Use the lowest effective dose for the    shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).
After observing the response to initial therapy with RELAFEN (nabumetone) , the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.
Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended starting dose    is 1,000 mg taken as a single dose with or without food. Some patients may obtain    more symptomatic relief from 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg per day. RELAFEN (nabumetone)  can be given    in either a single or twice-daily dose. Dosages greater than 2,000 mg per day    have not been studied. The lowest effective dose should be used for chronic    treatment (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects).    Patients weighing under 50 kg may be less likely to require dosages beyond 1,000    mg; therefore, after observing the response to initial therapy, the dose should    be adjusted to meet individual patients' requirements.
