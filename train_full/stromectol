The recommended dosage of STROMECTOL (ivermectin)  for the treatment of strongyloidiasis    is a single oral dose designed to provide approximately 200 mcg of ivermectin    per kg of body weight. See Table 1 for dosage guidelines. Patients should    take tablets on an empty stomach with water. (See CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics.) In general, additional doses are not    necessary. However, follow-up stool examinations should be performed to verify    eradication of infection. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical    Studies.)
