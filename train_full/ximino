The recommended dosage of Ximino is approximately 1 mg/kg once daily for 12 weeks. Higher doses have not shown to be of additional benefit in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of acne, and may be associated with more acute vestibular side effects.
The following table shows capsule strength and body weight to achieve approximately 1 mg/kg.
Table 1: Dosing Table for Ximino 
Ximino may be taken with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. The capsules should be swallowed whole without chewing, crushing or splitting. Ingestion of food along with Ximino may help reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.
In patients with renal impairment, the total dosage should be decreased by either reducing the recommended individual doses and/or by extending the time intervals between doses [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
