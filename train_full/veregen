Veregen® is to be applied three times per day to all external genital and perianal warts.
Apply about an 0.5 cm strand of the Veregen® to each wart using the finger(s), dabbing it on to ensure complete coverage and leaving a thin layer of the ointment on the warts. Patients should wash their hands before and after application of Veregen®.
It is not necessary to wash off the ointment from the treated area prior to the next application.
Veregen® is not for ophthalmic, oral, intravaginal, or intra-anal use.
Treatment with Veregen® should be continued until complete clearance of all warts, however no longer than 16 weeks.
Local skin reactions (e.g. erythema) at the treatment site are frequent. Nevertheless, treatment should be continued when the severity of the local skin reaction is acceptable.
