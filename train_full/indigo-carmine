Indigo Carmine (indigotindisulfonate)  solution is injected either by the intravenous or intramuscular route, and its appearance at the ureteral orifices is watched with the cystoscope in place. The intravenous method is preferred because a 5 mL injection is sufficient.A lesser dosage in infants, children and underweight patients will prevent skin coloration.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
