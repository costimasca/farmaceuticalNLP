Average expulsion rate of residue from spray, at normal temperatures, is 200 mg per second. 
Tissue need not be dried prior to application of Cetacaine (benzocaine, aminobenzoate and tetracaine) . Cetacaine (benzocaine, aminobenzoate and tetracaine)  should be applied directly to the site where pain control is required. Cetacaine (benzocaine, aminobenzoate and tetracaine)  Liquid may be applied with a cotton applicator or directly to tissue. The cotton applicator should not be held in position for extended periods of time, since local reactions to benzoate topical anesthetics are related to the length of time of application.
