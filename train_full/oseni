OSENI should be taken once daily and can be taken with or without food. The tablets must not be split before swallowing.
The recommended starting dose for OSENI (alogliptin and pioglitazone):
The OSENI dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 25 mg/45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by hemoglobin A1c  (A1C).
After initiation of OSENI or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention as has been seen with pioglitazone (e.g., weight gain, edema and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure) [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
No dose adjustment of OSENI is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl]  ≥ 60 mL/min).
The dose of OSENI is 12.5 mg/15 mg, 12.5 mg/30 mg or 12.5 mg/45 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl  ≥ 30 to  < 60 mL/min).
OSENI is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Coadministration of pioglitazone and alogliptin 6.25 mg once daily based on individual requirements may be considered in these patients.
Because there is a need for dose adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of OSENI therapy and periodically thereafter.
Coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately three-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of OSENI is 25 mg/15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
