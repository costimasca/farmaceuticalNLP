For the treatment of central precocious puberty (CPP), the recommended daily   dose of SYNAREL is 1600 μg. The dose can be in creased to 1800 μg daily   if adequate suppression cannot be achieved at 1600 μg/day.
The 1600 μg dose is achieved by two sprays (400 μg) into each nostril    in the morning (4 sprays) and two sprays into each nostril in the evening (4   sprays), a total of 8 sprays per day. The 1800 μg dose is achieved by 3 sprays   (600 μg) into alternating nostrils three times a day, a total of 9 sprays   per day. The pa tient's head should be tilted back slightly, and 30 seconds   should elapse between sprays.
If the prescribed therapy has been well tolerated by the patient, tr eatment   of CPP with SYNAREL should continue until resumption of puberty is desired.
There appeared to be no significant effect of rhinitis, i.e., nasal congestion,   on the systemic bioavailability of SYNAREL; however, if the use of a nasal decongestant    for rhinitis is necessary during treatment with SYNAREL, the d econgestant should   not be used until at least 2 hours following dosing with SYNAREL.
Sneezing during or immediately after dosing with SYNAREL should be avoided,   if possible, since this may impair drug absorption.
At 1600 μg/day, a bottle of SYNAREL provides about a 7-day supply (about   56 sprays). If the daily dose is increased, increase the supp ly to the patient   to ensure uninterrupted treatment for the duration of therapy.
