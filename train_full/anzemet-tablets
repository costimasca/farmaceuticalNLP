The recommended doses of ANZEMET Tablets should not be exceeded.
The recommended oral dosage of ANZEMET (dolasetron mesylate) is 100 mg given within one hour before chemotherapy.
The recommended oral dosage in pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age is 1.8 mg/kg given within one hour before chemotherapy, up to a maximum of 100 mg. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been established.
In children for whom the 100 mg tablet is not appropriate based on their weight or ability to swallow tablets, the ANZEMET Injection solution may be mixed into apple or apple-grape juice for oral dosing in pediatric patients. The diluted product may be kept up to 2 hours at room temperature before use. However, ANZEMET Injection solution when administered intravenously is contraindicated in adult and pediatric patients for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy due to dose dependent QT prolongation.
No dosage adjustment is recommended, however; ECG  monitoring is recommended for elderly and renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Humans).
