The recommended dosage of ARAVA is 20 mg once daily. Treatment may be initiated with or without a loading dose, depending upon the patient's risk of ARAVA-associated hepatotoxicity and ARAVA-associated myelosuppression. The loading dosage provides steady-state concentrations more rapidly.
The maximum recommended daily dosage is 20 mg once per day. Consider dosage reduction to 10 mg once daily for patients who are not able to tolerate 20 mg daily (i.e., for patients who experience any adverse events listed in Table 1).
Monitor patients carefully after dosage reduction and after stopping therapy with ARAVA, since the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, is slowly eliminated from the plasma [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. After stopping ARAVA treatment, an accelerated drug elimination procedure is recommended to reduce the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, teriflunomide [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Without use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach undetectable plasma teriflunomide concentrations after stopping ARAVA [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Prior to starting ARAVA treatment the following evaluations and tests are recommended:
