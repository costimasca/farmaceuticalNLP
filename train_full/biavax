Do not inject intravenously. 
The dosage of vaccine is the same for all persons. Inject the total volume (about 0.5 mL) of reconstituted vaccine subcutaneously, preferably into the outer aspect of upper arm. Do not give immune globulin (IG) concurrently with BIAVAX (rubella and mumps virus vaccine live)  II. 
During shipment, to insure that there is no loss of potency, the vaccine must be maintained at a temperature of 10°C (50°F) or less. 
Before reconstitution, store BIAVAX (rubella and mumps virus vaccine live)  II at 2-8°C (36-46°F). Protect from light. 
CAUTION:  A sterile syringe free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents should be used for each injection of the vaccine because these substances may inactivate the live virus vaccine. A 25 gauge, 5 / 8 [Prime ] needle is recommended. 
To reconstitute, use only the diluent supplied, since it is free of preservatives or other antiviral substances which might inactivate the vaccine. First withdraw the entire volume of diluent into the syringe to be used for reconstitution. Inject all the diluent in the syringe into the vial of lyophilized vaccine, and agitate to mix thoroughly. Withdraw the entire contents into a syringe and inject the total volume of restored vaccine subcutaneously. 
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual patient to prevent transmission of hepatitis B virus and other infectious agents from one person to another. 
Each dose of BIAVAX (rubella and mumps virus vaccine live)  II contains not less than the equivalent of 1,000 TCID 50 of the U.S. Reference Rubella Virus and 20,000 TCID 50 of the U.S. Reference Mumps Virus. 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. BIAVAX (rubella and mumps virus vaccine live)  II, when reconstituted, is clear yellow.
