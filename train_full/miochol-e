MiocholÂ® -E (acetylcholine chloride intraocular solution) is instilled into the anterior chamber before or after securing one or more sutures.
Instillation should be gentle and parallel to the iris face and tangential to pupil border.
If there are no mechanical hindrances, the pupil starts to constrict in seconds and the peripheral iris is drawn away from the angle of the anterior chamber. Any anatomical hindrance to miosis must be released to permit the desired effect of the drug. In most cases, 0.5 to 2 mL produces satisfactory miosis. Note that the syringe filter supplied with Miochol-E has a priming volume of 0.6 mL (approximately).
In cataract surgery, use Miochol-E only after delivery of the lens.
Aqueous solutions of acetylcholine chloride are unstable. Prepare solution immediately before use. Do not use solution which is not clear and colorless. Discard any solution that has not been used.
Discard the filter appropriately after use.
Do not reuse the syringe filter.
Do not aspirate and inject through the same filter.
