INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED AS A PART OF INTRAVENOUS NUTRITION    VIA PERIPHERAL VEIN OR BY CENTRAL VENOUS INFUSION.
THE INITIAL RATE OF INFUSION IN ADULTS SHOULD BE 1 ML/MINUTE FOR THE FIRST    15 TO 30 MINUTES OF INFUSION. IF NO UNTOWARD REACTIONS OCCUR (SEE ADVERSE    REACTIONS SECTION), THE INFUSION RATE CAN BE INCREASED TO 2 ML/MINUTE.    NOT MORE THAN 500 ML OF INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  (A 10% INTRAVENOUS FAT EMULSION)    SHOULD BE INFUSED INTO ADULTS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THERAPY. IF THE PATIENT HAS    NO UNTOWARD REACTIONS, THE DOSE CAN BE INCREASED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE DAILY    DOSAGE SHOULD NOT EXCEED 2.5 G OF FAT/KG OF BODY WEIGHT (25 ML OF INTRALIPID®    10% PER KG). INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  SHOULD MAKE UP NO MORE THAN 60% OF THE TOTAL    CALORIC INPUT TO THE PATIENT. CARBOHYDRATE AND A SOURCE OF AMINO ACIDS SHOULD    COMPRISE THE REMAINING CALORIC INPUT.
THE DOSAGE FOR PREMATURE INFANTS STARTS AT 0.5 G FAT/KG BODY WEIGHT/24 HOURS    (5 ML INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion) ) AND MAY BE INCREASED IN RELATION TO THE INFANTS    ABILITY TO ELIMINATE FAT. THE MAXIMUM DOSAGE RECOMMENDED BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY    OF PEDIATRICS IS 3 G FAT/KG/24 HOURS3. THE INITIAL RATE OF INFUSION    IN OLDER PEDIATRIC PATIENTS SHOULD BE NO MORE THAN 0.1 ML/MINUTE FOR THE FIRST    10 TO 15 MINUTES. IF NO UNTOWARD REACTIONS OCCUR, THE RATE CAN BE CHANGED TO    PERMIT INFUSION OF 1 ML OF INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion) /KG/HOUR. THE DAILY DOSAGE SHOULD    NOT EXCEED 3 G OF FAT/KG OF BODY WEIGHT3. INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  SHOULD MAKE UP    NO MORE THAN 60% OF THE TOTAL CALORIC INPUT TO THE PATIENT. CARBOHYDRATE AND    A SOURCE OF AMINO ACIDS SHOULD COMPRISE THE REMAINING CALORIC INPUT.
WHEN INTRALIPID® 10% (A 10% I.V. FAT EMULSION) IS ADMINISTERED TO CORRECT    ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID DEFICIENCY, EIGHT TO TEN PERCENT OF THE CALORIC INPUT SHOULD    BE SUPPLIED BY INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF LINOLEIC    AND LINOLENIC ACIDS. WHEN EFAD OCCURS TOGETHER WITH STRESS, THE AMOUNT OF INTRALIPID®    10% NEEDED TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCY MAY BE INCREASED.
SEE MIXING GUIDELINES AND LIMITATIONS SECTION FOR INFORMATION REGARDING    MIXING THIS FAT EMULSION WITH OTHER PARENTERAL FLUIDS.
INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  CAN BE INFUSED INTO THE SAME CENTRAL OR PERIPHERAL VEIN    AS CARBOHYDRATE/AMINO ACIDS SOLUTIONS BY MEANS OF A Y-CONNECTOR NEAR THE INFUSION    SITE. THIS ALLOWS FOR MIXING OF THE EMULSION IMMEDIATELY BEFORE ENTERING THE    VEIN OR FOR ALTERNATION OF EACH PARENTERAL FLUID. IF INFUSION PUMPS ARE USED,    FLOW RATES OF EACH PARENTERAL FLUID SHOULD BE CONTROLLED WITH A SEPARATE PUMP.    FAT EMULSION MAY ALSO BE INFUSED THROUGH A SEPARATE PERIPHERAL SITE. FILTERS    OF LESS THAN 1.2 MICRON PORE SIZE MUST NOT BE USED WITH INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion) .
CONVENTIONAL ADMINISTRATION SETS AND TPN POOLING BAGS CONTAIN POLYVINYL CHLORIDE    (PVC) COMPONENTS THAT HAVE DEHP (DIETHYL HEXYL PHTHALATE) AS A PLASTICIZER.    FAT-CONTAINING FLUIDS SUCH AS INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  EXTRACT DEHP FROM THESE PVC    COMPONENTS AND IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO CONSIDER INFUSION OF INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)     THROUGH A NON-DEHP ADMINISTRATION SET.
DO NOT USE ANY BAG IN WHICH THERE APPEARS TO BE AN OILING OUT ON THE SURFACE    OF THE EMULSION. PARENTERAL DRUG PRODUCTS SHOULD BE INSPECTED VISUALLY FOR PARTICULATE    MATTER AND DISCOLORATION PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION, WHENEVER SOLUTION AND CONTAINER    PERMIT.
MIXING GUIDELINES AND LIMITATIONS
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED WHICH DEMONSTRATE THE COMPATIBILITY OF INTRALIPID®    10% WHEN PROPERLY MIXED WITH EITHER NOVAMINE® OR 8.5% TRAVASOL® OR 10%    TRAVASOL® AMINO ACID INJECTIONS WITHOUT ELECTROLYTES FOR USE IN TPN THERAPY.    THE FOLLOWING PROPER MIXING SEQUENCE MUST BE FOLLOWED TO MINIMIZE PH RELATED    PROBLEMS BY ENSURING THAT TYPICALLY ACIDIC DEXTROSE INJECTIONS ARE NOT MIXED    WITH LIPID EMULSIONS ALONE:
NOTE: AMINO ACID INJECTION, DEXTROSE INJECTION AND INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  MAY    BE SIMULTANEOUSLY TRANSFERRED TO THE ADMIXTURE CONTAINER. ADMIXING SHOULD BE    ACCOMPANIED BY GENTLE AGITATION TO AVOID LOCALIZED CONCENTRATION EFFECTS.
THESE ADMIXTURES SHOULD BE USED PROMPTLY WITH STORAGE UNDER REFRIGERATION (2-8°C)    NOT TO EXCEED 24 HOURS AND MUST BE COMPLETELY USED WITHIN 24 HOURS AFTER REMOVAL    FROM REFRIGERATION.
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE ADMIXTURE BE PREPARED USING STRICT ASEPTIC TECHNIQUES    AS THIS NUTRIENT MIXTURE IS A GOOD GROWTH MEDIUM FOR MICROORGANISMS.
ADDITIVES OTHER THAN THOSE NAMED ABOVE MAY BE INCOMPATIBLE. COMPLETE INFORMATION    IS NOT AVAILABLE. THOSE ADDITIVES KNOWN TO BE INCOMPATIBLE SHOULD NOT BE USED.    CONSULT WITH PHARMACIST, IF AVAILABLE. IF, IN THE INFORMED JUDGMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN,    IT IS DEEMED ADVISABLE TO INTRODUCE ADDITIVES, USE ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE. MIX THOROUGHLY    WHEN ADDITIVES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. DO NOT STORE SOLUTIONS CONTAINING ADDITIVES    (E.G., VITAMINS AND MINERALS). ADDITIVES MUST NOT BE ADDED DIRECTLY TO INTRALIPID®    10% AND IN NO CASE SHOULD INTRALIPID® 10% (10% i.v fat emulsion)  BE ADDED TO THE TPN CONTAINER    FIRST. BAGS SHOULD BE SHAKEN GENTLY AFTER EACH ADDITION TO MINIMIZE LOCALIZED    CONCENTRATION.
SUPPLEMENTAL ELECTROLYTES, TRACE METALS OR MULTIVITAMINS MAY BE REQUIRED IN    ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESCRIPTION OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN.
THE PRIME DESTABILIZERS OF EMULSIONS ARE EXCESSIVE ACIDITY (LOW PH) AND INAPPROPRIATE    ELECTROLYTE CONTENT. CAREFUL CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ADDITIONS OF DIVALENT    CATIONS (CA++ AND MG++) WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE EMULSION INSTABILITY.    AMINO ACID SOLUTIONS EXERT A BUFFERING EFFECT PROTECTING THE EMULSION.
THE ADMIXTURE SHOULD BE INSPECTED CAREFULLY FOR &LDQUO;BREAKING OR OILING    OUT &LDQUO; OF THE EMULSION. &LDQUO;BREAKING OR OILING OUT&RDQUO;    IS DESCRIBED AS THE SEPARATION OF THE EMULSION AND CAN BE VISIBLY IDENTIFIED    BY A YELLOWISH STREAKING OR THE ACCUMULATION OF YELLOWISH DROPLETS IN THE ADMIXED    EMULSION. THE ADMIXTURE SHOULD ALSO BE EXAMINED FOR PARTICULATES. THE ADMIXTURE    MUST BE DISCARDED IF ANY OF THE ABOVE IS OBSERVED.
