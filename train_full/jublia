Apply JUBLIA to affected toenails once daily for 48 weeks, using the integrated flow-through brush applicator. When applying JUBLIA, ensure the toenail, the toenail folds, toenail bed, hyponychium, and the undersurface of the toenail plate, are completely covered. JUBLIA is for topical use only and not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
