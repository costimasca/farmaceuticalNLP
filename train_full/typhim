Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The syringe or vial and its packaging should also be inspected prior to use for evidence of leakage, premature activation of the plunger, or a faulty tip seal. If any of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.
For intramuscular use only. Do NOT inject intravenously.
The immunizing dose for adults and children is a single injection of 0.5 mL. The dose for adults is typically given intramuscularly in the deltoid, and the dose for children is given IM either in the deltoid or the anterolateral thigh. The vaccine should not be injected into the gluteal area or areas where there may be a nerve trunk.
A reimmunizing dose is 0.5 mL. Reimmunization consisting of a single dose for US travelers every two years under conditions of repeated or continued exposure to the S typhi organism is recommended at this time.14
The syringe is intended for single use only, must not be reused, and must be disposed of properly and promptly following its use.
The skin at the site of injection first should be cleansed and disinfected. Tear off upper seal of vial cap. Cleanse top of rubber stopper of the vial with a suitable antiseptic and wipe away all excess antiseptic before withdrawing vaccine.
