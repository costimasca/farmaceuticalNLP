Regardless of the indication, the starting dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be 5 mg twice daily, followed by adjustment based on therapeutic response and tolerability. Patients with mild hepatic insufficiency do not require dosage reductions. The use of pilocarpine in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency is not recommended. If needed, refer to the Hepatic Insufficiency subsection of the Precautions section of this label for definitions of mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment.
 The recommended   initial dose of SALAGEN® Tablets is 5 mg taken three times a day. Dosage should   be titrated according to therapeutic response and tolerance. The usual dosage   range is up to 15-30 mg per day. (Not to exceed 10 mg per dose.) Although early   improvement may be realized, at least 12 weeks of uninterrupted therapy with   SALAGEN® Tablets may be necessary to assess whether a beneficial response will   be achieved. The incidence of the most common adverse events increases with dose.   The lowest dose that is tolerated and effective should be used for maintenance.
 The recommended dose of   SALAGEN® Tablets is 5 mg taken four times a day. Efficacy was established by 6   weeks of use.
