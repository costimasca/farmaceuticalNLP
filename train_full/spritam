Administer SPRITAM orally, with or without food, with a sip of liquid. Only whole tablets should be given. The SPRITAM dosing regimen depends on the indication, age group, and renal function. SPRITAM disintegrates in a mean time of 11 seconds (ranging from 2 to 27 seconds) in the mouth when taken with a sip of liquid. SPRITAM should not be swallowed intact.
Patients should be instructed not to push the tablet through the foil. The foil should be peeled from the blister by bending and lifting the peel tab around the blister seal. Place the tablet on the tongue with a dry hand and follow with a sip of liquid. The tablet should be swallowed only after it disintegrates.
Initiate SPRITAM with a daily dose of 1000 mg, given as twice daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). The daily dose may be increased every 2 weeks by increments of 1000 mg (500 mg twice daily) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg (1500 mg twice daily). There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.
Initiate SPRITAM with a daily dose of 500 mg, given as twice daily dosing (250 mg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 500 mg (250 mg twice daily) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 1500 mg (750 mg twice daily).
Initiate SPRITAM with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day (500 mg twice daily) every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg (1500 mg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied.
Initiate SPRITAM with a daily dose of 1000 mg, given as twice daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day (500 mg twice daily) every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg (1500 mg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.
Initiate SPRITAM with a daily dose of 500 mg, given as twice daily dosing (250 mg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 500 mg (250 mg twice daily) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 1500 mg (750 mg twice daily).
SPRITAM dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:
