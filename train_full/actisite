Actisite (tetracycline periodontal)  periodontal fiber for 10 days is indicated as an adjunct to scaling and root planing. Repeated fiber applications have not been studied. Actisite (tetracycline periodontal)  fiber should be inserted into the periodontal pocket until the pocket is filled. The length of fiber used will vary with pocket depth and contour. The fiber should be placed to closely approximate the pocket anatomy and should be in contact with the base of the pocket. An appropriate cyanoacrylate adhesive should be used to help secure the fiber in the pocket. 
When placed within a periodontal pocket, Actisite (tetracycline periodontal)  fiber provides continuous release of tetracycline for 10 days. At the end of 10 days of treatment, all fibers must be removed. Fibers lost before 7 days should be replaced.
