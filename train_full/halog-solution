Apply HALOG SOLUTION (Halcinonide Topical Solution, USP) 0.1% to the affected    area two to three times daily.
Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or other recalcitrant    conditions. Apply the solution to the lesion, cover with a pliable nonporous    film, and seal the edges. If needed, additional moisture may be provided by    covering the lesion with a dampened clean cotton cloth before the nonporous    film is applied or by briefly wetting the affected area with water immediately    prior to applying the medication. The frequency of changing dressings is best    determined on an individual basis. It may be convenient to apply HALOG SOLUTION (halcinonide topical solution)     under an occlusive dressing in the evening and to remove the dressing in the    morning (i.e., 12-hour occlusion). When utilizing the 12-hour occlusion regimen,    additional solution should be applied, without occlusion, during the day. Reapplication    is essential at each dressing change.
If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued    and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.
