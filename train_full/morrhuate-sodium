Morrhuate Sodium is administered only by INTRAVENOUS injection. Care must be taken to avoid extravasation. (See Cautions.) Specialized references should be consulted for specific procedures and techniques of administration. When small veins are injected, or the injection solution is cold, or if solid matter has separated in the solution, the vial should be warmed by immersing in hot water. The solution should become clear on warming. Only a clear solution should be used. Because the solution froths easily, a large bore needle should be used to fill the syringe. However, a small bore needle should be used for the injection.
To determine possible sensitivity to the drug, some clinicians recommend injection of 0.25 to 1 mL of 5% Morrhuate Sodium Injection into a varicosity 24 hours before administration of a large dose.
Dosage of Morrhuate Sodium depends on the size and degree of varicosity. The usual adult dose for obliteration of small or medium veins is 50 to 100 mg (1 to 2 mL of the 5% injection). For large veins, 150 to 250 mg (3 to 5 mL of the injection) is used. The drug may be given as multiple injections at one time or in single doses. Therapy may be repeated 5 to 7 day intervals, according to the patient's response. Following injection of Morrhuate Sodium, the vein promptly becomes hard and swollen for 2 to 4 inches, depending on the size and response of the vein. After 24 hours, the vein is hard and slightly tender to the touch (with little or no periphlebitis). The skin around the injection becomes light-bronze. This color usually disappears shortly. An aching sensation and feeling of stiffness usually occurs and lasts approximately 48 hours.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
