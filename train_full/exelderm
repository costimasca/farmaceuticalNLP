A small amount of the solution should be gently massaged into the affected and surrounding skin areas once or twice daily.
Symptomatic relief usually occurs within a few days after starting EXELDERM (sulconazole nitrate) SOLUTION, 1.0%, and clinical improvement usually occurs within one week. To reduce the possibility of recurrence, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and tinea versicolor should be treated for 3 weeks.
If significant clinical improvement is not seen after 4 weeks of treatment, an alternate diagnosis should be considered.
