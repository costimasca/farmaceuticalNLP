EMTRIVA may be taken without regard to food.
Significantly increased drug exposures were seen when EMTRIVA was administered to subjects with renal impairment [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Therefore, the dosing interval or dose of EMTRIVA should be adjusted in patients with baseline creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min using the following guidelines (see Table 1). The safety and effectiveness of these dose adjustment guidelines have not been clinically evaluated. Therefore, clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients.
Table 1 : Dose Adjustment in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment 
Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dose adjustment of EMTRIVA in pediatric patients with renal impairment, a reduction in the dose and/or an increase in the dosing interval similar to adjustments for adults should be considered.
