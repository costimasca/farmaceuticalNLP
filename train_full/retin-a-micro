Retin-A Micro (tretinoin gel) microsphere, 0.1% and 0.04%, should be applied   once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough   to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application of excessive amounts   of gel may result in “caking” of the gel, and will not provide incremental efficacy.
A transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging may be noted on application. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or the frequency of application increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once daily dosing frequencies.
During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. If tolerated, this should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy.
Therapeutic results may be noticed after two weeks, but more than seven weeks of therapy are required before consistent beneficial effects are observed.
Patients treated with Retin-A Micro (tretinoin gel) microsphere, 0.1% and 0.04%, may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied.
