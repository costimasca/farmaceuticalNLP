Recommended Dosing Schedule
 
A clearly-labeled kit is required for preparation of  Yttrium-90 (Y-90) Zevalin. Follow the detailed instructions for the preparation of radiolabeled Zevalin [see Procedure for Determining Radiochemical Purity].
Required materials not supplied in the kit:
Use the following procedures for radiolabeling Y-90 Zevalin:
During clinical trials with Zevalin, estimations of  radiation-absorbed doses for Y-90 Zevalin were performed using sequential whole body images and the MIRDOSE 3 software program. The estimated radiation absorbed doses to organs and marrow from a course of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen are summarized in Table 1. Absorbed dose estimates for the lower large intestine, upper large intestine, and small intestine have been modified from the standard MIRDOSE 3 output to account for the assumption that activity is within the intestine wall rather than the intestine contents.
