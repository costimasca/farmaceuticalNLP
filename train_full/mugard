Gently pour 5 mL of MuGard into the mouth and rinse the entire oral cavity for a minute or longer if possible. If the action of rinsing is inconvenient or too painful, MuGard can be spread throughout the mouth by a gentle rotating action of the head. Ensure that all parts of the oral cavity have been coated with the rinse. If necessary, up to 10 mL may be used to fully coat the inside of the mouth. After rinsing, excess rinse may be expelled or swallowed.
For the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis, it is recommended that MuGard is used 4-6 times a day. It is recommended that patients purchase MuGard prior to the commencement of cancer therapy.
For other ulcerative conditions of the oral cavity, MuGard should be used 4-6 times a day or as needed.
