For Autologous Implantation Only
Patients in the Swedish series [see Clinical Studies] received a wide range of cell doses per cm² of defect. Available data on 70 of 78 patients with femoral condyle defects showed a median dose of 1.6 million cells/cm² of defect. The middle 80% of these patients received from 0.64 million to 3.3 million cells/cm².
Each Carticel finished product vial contains approximately 12 million cells. Vericel provides a single vial for each defect measuring  ≤  7 cm². Two vials of Carticel are provided for defects 7 to 14 cm², and three vials are provided for defects > 14 cm². This is based on Vericel's greater than 10 years of experience with Carticel.
The Carticel product is intended solely for autologous use. Prior to Carticel implantation, match the patient name and ID number on the certificate of analysis to the patient's chart and the patient ID on the shipping box, transport cylinder and vial.
Health care providers should employ universal precautions in handling the biopsy samples and the Carticel product [see Risk of Transmissible Infectious Diseases].
Refer to the Indications and Usage and Warnings and Precautions Sections for additional considerations regarding the use of Carticel.
NOTE:
The exterior of the Carticel vial containing the cultured cells is NOT sterile. Follow strict sterile technique protocols.
When treating a defect that requires multiple vials of cells, resuspend, aspirate and inject one vial at a time.
Implantation of the Carticel product should be restricted to physicians who have completed Vericel's Surgeon Training Program.
Implantation of the Carticel® product is performed during arthrotomy and requires both preparation of the defect bed and a periosteal flap to secure the implant. Complete hemostasis must be achieved prior to periosteal fixation and cell implantation. See the Carticel Surgical Manual, Vericel document #65021 for instructions on the performance of these procedures.
