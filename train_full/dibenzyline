The dosage should be adjusted to fit the needs of each patient. Small initial    doses should be slowly increased until the desired effect is obtained    or the side effects from blockade become troublesome. After each increase,    the patient should be observed on that level before instituting another increase.    The dosage should be carried to a point where symptomatic relief and/or objective    improvement are obtained, but not so high that the side effects from blockade    become troublesome.
Initially, 10 mg of Dibenzyline (phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride) twice a day. Dosage should be increased every other day, usually to 20 to 40 mg 2 or 3 times a day, until an optimal dosage is obtained, as judged by blood pressure control.
Long-term use of phenoxybenzamine is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS    Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis).
Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°- 30°C (59°- 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].
