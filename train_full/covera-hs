COVERA-HS should be administered once daily at bedtime. Clinical trials explored   dose ranges between 180 mg and 540 mg given at bedtime and found effects to   persist throughout the dosing interval.
COVERA-HS tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed.
For both hypertension and angina, the dose of COVERA-HS should be individualized   by titration. Initiate therapy with 180 mg of COVERA-HS.
If an adequate response is not obtained with 180 mg of COVERA-HS, the dose   may be titrated upward in the following manner:
When COVERA-HS is administered at bedtime, office evaluation of blood pressure   during morning and early afternoon hours is essentially a measure of peak effect.   The usual evaluation of trough effect, which sometimes might be needed to evaluate   the appropriateness of any given dose of COVERA-HS, would be just prior to bedtime.
