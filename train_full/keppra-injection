Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.
1 Month To  <  6 Months
Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group. The effectiveness of lower doses has not been studied.
6 Months To  <  4 Years
Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.
4 Years To  <  16 Years
Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.
Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied.
Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.
Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg twice daily) to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied.
When switching from oral KEPPRA, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of KEPPRA should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral KEPPRA.
At the end of the intravenous treatment period, the patient may be switched to KEPPRA oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.
KEPPRA injection is for intravenous use only and should be diluted in 100 mL of a compatible diluent prior to administration. If a smaller volume is required (e.g. pediatric patients), the amount of diluent should be calculated to not exceed a maximum levetiracetam concentration of 15 mg per mL of diluted solution. Consideration should also be given to the total daily fluid intake of the patient. KEPPRA injection should be administered as a 15-minute IV infusion. One vial of KEPPRA injection contains 500 mg levetiracetam (500 mg/5 mL).
KEPPRA injection may be mixed with the following diluents and antiepileptic drugs and may be stored in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags. The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at controlled room temperature [15-30°C (59-86°F)].
Sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP   Lactated Ringer's injection   Dextrose 5% injection, USP 
Lorazepam   Diazepam   Valproate sodium 
There are no data to support the physical compatibility of KEPPRA injection with antiepileptic drugs that are not listed above.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Product with particulate matter or discoloration should not be used.
Any unused portion of the KEPPRA injection vial contents should be discarded.
See Table 1 for the recommended preparation and administration of KEPPRA injection for adults to achieve a dose of 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 1500 mg.
Table 1: Preparation and Administration of KEPPRA Injection for Adults 
For example, to prepare a 1000 mg dose, dilute 10 mL of KEPPRA injection in 100 mL of a compatible diluent and administer intravenously as a 15-minute infusion.
When using KEPPRA injection for pediatric patients, dosing is weight-based (mg per kg).
The following calculation should be used to determine the appropriate daily dose of KEPPRA injection for pediatric patients:
Total daily dose (mL/day) = Daily dose (mg/kg/day) Ã— patient weight (kg)/ 100 mg/mL
KEPPRA dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults with renal impairment are shown in Table 2. Information is unavailable for dosage adjustments in pediatric patients with renal impairment. In order to calculate the dose recommended for adult patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:
