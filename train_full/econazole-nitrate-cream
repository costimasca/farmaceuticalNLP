Sufficient econazole nitrate cream should be applied to cover affected areas   once daily in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and tinea   versicolor, and twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with cutaneous   candidiasis.
Early relief of symptoms is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical   improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal   infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and   tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence.   If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis   should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical   and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.
