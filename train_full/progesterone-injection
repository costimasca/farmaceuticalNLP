Progesterone is administered by intramuscular injection. It differs from other commonly used steroids in that it is irritating at the place of injection.
Amenorrhea: Five to 10 mg are given for six to eight consecutive days.    If there has been sufficient ovarian activity to produce a proliferative endometrium,    one can expect withdrawal bleeding forty-eight to seventy-two hours after the    last injection. This may be followed by spontaneous normal cycles.
Functional Uterine Bleeding: Five to 10 mg are given daily for six doses.    Bleeding may be expected to cease within six days. When estrogen is given as    well, the administration of progesterone is begun after two weeks of estrogen therapy. If menstrual flow begins during the course of injections of progesterone,    they are discontinued.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit.
