The oral dose and interval of administration should be adjusted for the individual patient, based on clinical assessment of the degree of underlying myocardial disease, the patient's age, and renal function. 
As a general guide, for younger patients with normal renal function, an initial total daily oral dose of up to 50 mg/kg of body weight of procainamide hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be used, given in divided doses, every six hours, to maintain therapeutic blood levels. For older patients especially those over 50 years of age, or for patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac insufficiency, lesser amounts or longer intervals may produce adequate blood levels, and decrease the probability of occurrence of dose related adverse reactions.
