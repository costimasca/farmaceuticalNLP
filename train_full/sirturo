Prior to treatment with SIRTURO, obtain the following:
Only use SIRTURO in combination with at least 3 other drugs to which the patient's MDR-TB isolate has been shown to be susceptible in vitro. If in vitro testing results are unavailable, SIRTURO treatment may be initiated in combination with at least 4 other drugs to which the patient's MDR-TB isolate is likely to be susceptible.
The recommended dosage of SIRTURO is 400 mg orally once daily for the first two weeks, followed by 200 mg orally three times per week (with at least 48 hours between doses) for 22 weeks (total duration of 24 weeks).
The SIRTURO tablet should be swallowed whole with water and taken with food.
If a dose is missed during the first 2 weeks of treatment, do not administer the missed dose (skip the dose and then continue the daily dosing regimen). From Week 3 onwards, if a 200 mg dose is missed, administer the missed dose as soon as possible, and then resume the 3 times a week dosing regimen.
