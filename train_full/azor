The side effects of olmesartan medoxomil are generally rare and apparently independent of dose. Those of amlodipine are generally dose-dependent (mostly edema).
Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 weeks after a change in dose.
Azor may be taken with or without food.
Azor may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.
Dosage may be increased after 2 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of Azor is 10/40 mg.
Azor may be substituted for its individually titrated components.
When substituting for individual components, the dose of one or both of the components can be increased if blood pressure control has not been satisfactory.
Azor may be used to provide additional blood pressure lowering for patients not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with olmesartan medoxomil (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone.
The usual starting dose of Azor is 5/20 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum dose of one 10/40 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure [See Clinical Studies].
Initial therapy with Azor is not recommended in patients â‰¥75 years old or with hepatic impairment [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use In Specific Populations].
