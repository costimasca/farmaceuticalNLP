The recommended initial dose of PHOSLYRA for the adult dialysis patient is 10 mL with each meal. Increase the dose gradually to lower serum phosphorus levels to the target range, as long as hypercalcemia does not develop. Titrate the dose every 2 to 3 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphorus level is reached. Most patients require 15â€“20 mL with each meal.
