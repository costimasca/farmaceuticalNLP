ConZip™ is an extended-release formulation intended for once a day dosing in adults aged 18 years and older. The tablets must be swallowed whole with liquid and must not be split, chewed, dissolved or crushed. Chewing, crushing or splitting the tablet could result in the uncontrolled delivery of tramadol, in overdose and death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Drug Abuse And Dependence, and OVERDOSE].
Do not administer ConZip™ at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day. Do not use ConZip™ more than once daily or concomitantly with other tramadol products [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Initiate treatment with ConZip™ at a dose of 100 mg once daily and titrated up as necessary by 100 mg increments every five days to achieve a balance between relief of pain and tolerability.
Calculate the 24-hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of ConZip™ rounded down to the next lowest 100 mg increment. The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need. Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with ConZip™, some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to ConZip™.
Initiate dosing of an elderly patient (over 65 years of age) should be initiated cautiously, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. ConZip™ should be administered with even greater caution in patients over 75 years, due to the greater frequency of adverse events seen in this population.
The limited availability of dose strengths and once daily dosing of ConZip™ do not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe renal impairment. Do not use ConZip™ in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
The limited availability of dose strengths and once daily dosing of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release capsules do not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Do not use ConZip™ in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Withdrawal symptoms may occur if ConZip™ is discontinued abruptly. Clinical experience with tramadol suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering ConZip™ [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Drug Abuse And Dependence].
ConZip™ may be taken without regard to food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
