THE DOSAGE OF PERIOSTAT速 (doxycycline hyclate)  DIFFERS FROM THAT OF DOXYCYCLINE USED TO TREAT    INFECTIONS. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE    OF SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANT MICROORGANISMS.
Periostat速 (doxycycline hyclate)  20 mg twice daily as an adjunct following scaling and root planing   may be administered for up to 9 months. Periostat速 (doxycycline hyclate)  should be taken twice   daily at 12 hour intervals, usually in the morning and evening. It is recommended   that if Periostat速 (doxycycline hyclate)  is taken close to meal times, allow at least one hour   prior to or two hours after meals. Safety beyond 12 months and efficacy beyond   9 months have not been established.
Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with the tablets is recommended    to wash down the drug and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.    (See ADVERSE REACTIONS Section).
