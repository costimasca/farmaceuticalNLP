The recommended initial dose of Tenex (guanfacine hydrochloride) when given alone or in combination with another antihypertensive drug is 1 mg daily given at bedtime to minimize somnolence. If after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy 1 mg does not give a satisfactory result, a dose of 2 mg may be given, although most of the effect of Tenex is seen at 1 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Higher daily doses have been used, but adverse reactions increase significantly with doses above 3 mg/day.
The frequency of rebound hypertension is low, but it can occur. When rebound occurs, it does so after 2 - 4 days, which is delayed compared with clonidine hydrochloride. This is consistent with the longer half-life of guanfacine. In most cases, after abrupt withdrawal of guanfacine, blood pressure returns to pretreatment levels slowly (within 2 - 4 days) without ill effects.
