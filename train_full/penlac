PENLAC® NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, should be used   as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis. Removal   of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care   professional, weekly trimming by the patient, and daily application of the medication   are all integral parts of this therapy. Careful consideration of the appropriate   nail management program should be given to patients with diabetes (see PRECAUTIONS).
Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, trimming of onycholytic nail, and filing of excess horny material should be performed by professionals trained in treatment of nail disorders.
Patients should file away (with emery board) loose nail material and trim nails, as required, or as directed by the health care professional, every seven days after PENLAC® NAIL LACQUER (ciclopirox) Topical Solution, 8%, is removed with alcohol.
