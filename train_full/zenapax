ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  is used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen that includes cyclosporine    and corticosteroids. The recommended dose for ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  in adult and pediatric    patients is 1.0 mg/kg (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric    Use). The calculated volume of ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  should be mixed with 50 mL of sterile    0.9% sodium chloride solution and administered via a peripheral or central vein    over a 15-minute period.
Based on the clinical trials, the standard course of ZENAPAX (daclizumab)  therapy is five doses. The first dose should be given no more than 24 hours before transplantation. The four remaining doses should be given at intervals of 14 days.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with severe renal impairment. No dosage adjustments based on other identified covariates (age, gender, proteinuria, race) are required for renal allograft patients. No data are available for administration in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
