As initial therapy and in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 80 mg or nebivolol up to and including 10 mg, the recommended dose of BYVALSON is one tablet, 5 mg/ 80 mg (nebivolol/valsartan) taken orally once daily. Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 to 4 weeks. Increasing the dose of BYVALSON does not result in any meaningful further blood pressure reduction [see Clinical Studies].
BYVALSON may be substituted for its components in patients already receiving 5 mg nebivolol and 80 mg valsartan.
