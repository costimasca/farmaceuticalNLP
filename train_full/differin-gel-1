DIFFERINÂ® (adapalene gel)  Gel should be applied once a day to affected areas after washing    in the evening before retiring. A thin film of the gel should be applied, avoiding    eyes, lips, and mucous membranes.
During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of acne may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after eight to twelve weeks of treatment.
