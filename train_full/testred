Methyltestosterone capsules are administered orally. The suggested dosage for   androgens varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individual   patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient's response and the appearance   of adverse reactions.
Replacement therapy in androgen-deficient males is 10 to 50 mg of Methyltestosterone   daily. Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in   hypogonadal males, some experts have advocated lower dosages initially, gradually   increasing the dose as puberty progresses with or without a decrease to maintenance   levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal   changes and lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological   and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration both in determining the initial   dose and in adjusting the dose.
Doses used in delayed puberty generally are in the lower range of that given   above, and for a limited duration, for example 4 to 6 months.
Women with metastatic breast carcinoma must be followed closely because androgen   therapy occasionally appears to accelerate the disease. Thus, many experts prefer   to use the shorter acting androgen preparations rather than those with prolonged   activity for treating breast carcinoma, particularly during the early stages   of androgen therapy. The dosage of Methyltestosterone for androgen therapy in   breast carcinoma in females is from 50-200 mg daily.
