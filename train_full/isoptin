The dose of ISOPTIN SR should be individualized by titration and the drug should   be administered with food. Initiate therapy with 180 mg of sustained-release   verapamil HCl, ISOPTIN SR, given in the morning. Lower, initial doses of 120   mg a day may be warranted in patients who may have an increased response to   verapamil (e.g., the elderly or small people etc.). Upward titration should   be based on therapeutic efficacy and safety evaluated weekly and approximately   24 hours after the previous dose. The antihypertensive effects of ISOPTIN SR   are evident within the first week of therapy.
If adequate response is not obtained with 180 mg of ISOPTIN SR, the dose may   be titrated upward in the following manner:
When switching from immediate release ISOPTIN to ISOPTIN SR, the total daily   dose in milligrams may remain the same.
