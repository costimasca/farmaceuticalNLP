[see INDICATIONS AND USAGE]
The recommended regimen is:
Instruct patients to do the following:
Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] and to take calcium supplements, antacids, magnesium-based supplements or laxatives, and iron preparations at a different time of the day as they interfere with the absorption of Atelvia.
If the once-weekly dose is missed, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember and return to taking one tablet once-a-week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day. Patients should not take two tablets on the same day.
