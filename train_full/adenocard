For rapid bolus intravenous use only.
Adenocard (adenosine injection) should be given as a rapid bolus by the   peripheral intravenous route. To be certain the solution reaches the systemic   circulation, it should be administered either directly into a vein or, if given   into an IV line, it should be given as close to the patient as possible and   followed by a rapid saline flush.
The dose recommendation is based on clinical studies with peripheral venous bolus dosing. Central venous (CVP or other) administration of Adenocard has not been systematically studied.
The recommended intravenous doses for adults are as follows:
Initial dose: 6 mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus (administered   over a 1-2 second period).
Repeat administration: If the first dose does not result in elimination   of the supraventricular tachycardia within 1-2 minutes, 12 mg should be given   as a rapid intravenous bolus. This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time   if required.
The dosages used in neonates, infants, children and adolescents were equivalent to those administered to adults on a weight basis.
Pediatric Patients with a Body Weight  <  50 kg:
Initial dose: Give 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg as a rapid IV bolus given either   centrally or peripherally. A saline flush should follow.
Repeat administration: If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1-2   minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally   higher doses, increasing the amount given by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. Follow each   bolus with a saline flush. This process should continue until sinus rhythm is   established or a maximum single dose of 0.3 mg/kg is used.
Pediatric Patients with a Body Weight  â‰¥  50 kg: Administer the adult   dose.
Doses greater than 12 mg are not recommended for adult and pediatric patients.
NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
