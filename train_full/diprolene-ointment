Apply a thin film of DIPROLENE Ointment to the affected skin areas once or twice daily.
Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary. DIPROLENE Ointment is a super-high-potency topical corticosteroid. Treatment with DIPROLENE Ointment should not exceed 50 g per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
DIPROLENE Ointment should not be used with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.
DIPROLENE Ointment is for topical use only. It is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
Avoid use on the face, groin, or axillae, or if skin atrophy is present at the treatment site.
