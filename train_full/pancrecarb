Dosage should be individualized and adjusted according to fat intake, severity    of steatorrhea and the severity of the exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Begin    therapy with one or two capsules with meals or snacks and adjust dosage according    to symptoms. Dose increases, if required, should be made slowly, with careful    monitoring of response and symptomatology. It is important to ensure adequate    hydration of patients at all times while taking PANCRECARBÂ® (pancrelipase) . Patients with    pancreatic enzyme insufficiency should consume a high-caloric diet with unrestricted    fat intake, which is appropriate for age and clinical symptomology.
