The recommended starting dose of MOTOFEN® tablets in adults is 2 tablets then 1 tablet after each loose stool or 1 tablet every 3 to 4 hours as needed, but the total dosage during any 24-hour treatment period should not exceed 8 tablets. In the treatment of diarrhea, if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours, continued administration of this type of medication is not recommended. For acute diarrheas and acute exacerbations of functional diarrhea, treatment beyond 48 hours is usually not necessary.
Studies in children below the age of 12 have been inadequate to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MOTOFEN® in this age group. MOTOFEN® is contraindicated in children under 2 years of age.
