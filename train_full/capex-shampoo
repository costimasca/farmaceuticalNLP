The pharmacist must empty the contents of the enclosed capsule into the shampoo base prior to dispensing to the patient. This product should be shaken well prior to use. No more than approximately one (1) ounce of the medicated shampoo should be applied to the scalp area once daily, worked into a lather and allowed to remain on the scalp for approximately 5 minutes. The hair and scalp should then be rinsed thoroughly with water.
