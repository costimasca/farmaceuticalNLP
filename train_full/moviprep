There are two possible dosing regimens. Each regimen requires different dosing times:
Both MoviPrep dosing regimens require administration of MoviPrep using the mixing container provided to dilute powder for oral solution (contents of Pouch A and B) with water to the Fill line. Preparation of MoviPrep solution (the contents of one Pouch A and one Pouch B) occurs twice in each dosing regimen. Additional fluids must be consumed in both dosing regimens [see Split-dose (2-Day) Regimen (Preferred Method) and Evening only (1-Day) Regimen (Alternative Method)]. Instruct patients to consume only clear liquids (no solid food) from the start of MoviPrep treatment until after the colonoscopy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Additionally, instruct patients to not consume any clear liquids at least 2 hours before the colonoscopy.
The Split-Dose regimen is the preferred dosing method. Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids, as follows:
The Day-Before regimen is the alternative dosing method for patients for whom the Split-Dosing regimen is inappropriate. Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows:
MoviPrep solution may be refrigerated before drinking. Keep the mixed solution in an upright position and store in the refrigerator. MoviPrep should be taken within 24 hours after it is mixed in water. Do not add other ingredients to the MoviPrep solution.
