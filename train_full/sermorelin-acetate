 A dosage of 0.2 - 0.3 mcg once daily at bedtime by subcutaneous injection   is recommended. It is also recommended that subcutaneous injection sites be   periodically rotated.
To prevent possible contamination, wipe the rubber vial stopper with an antiseptic solution before puncturing it with the needle. It is recommended that Sermorelin be administered using sterile, disposable syringes and needles. The syringes should be of small enough volume that the prescribed dose can be drawn from the vial with reasonable accuracy.
To reconstitute Sermorelin, inject the diluent into the vial of Sermorelin   aiming the liquid against the glass vial wall. Swirl the vial with a GENTLE   rotary motion until contents are dissolved completely. Do not administer Sermorelin   if particles are visible in the reconstituted solution or if the reconstituted   solution is cloudy.
