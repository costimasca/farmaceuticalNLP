The recommended daily dose of NEXAVAR is 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) taken twice daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Treatment should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.
Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of NEXAVAR. When dose reduction is necessary, the NEXAVAR dose may be reduced to 400 mg once daily. If additional dose reduction is required, NEXAVAR may be reduced to a single 400 mg dose every other day [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Suggested dose modifications for skin toxicity are outlined in Table 1.
Table 1: Suggested Dose Modifications for Skin Toxicity 
No dose adjustment is required on the basis of patient age, gender, or body weight.
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, St. John's wort), when possible, because inducers can decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
