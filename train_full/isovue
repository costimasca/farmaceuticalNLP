Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Iopamidol solutions should be used only if clear and within the normal colorless to pale yellow range.
Discard any product which shows signs of crystallization or damage to the container-closure system, which includes the glass container, stopper and/or crimp.
It is desirable that solutions of radiopaque diagnostic agents for intravascular use be at body temperature when injected. Withdrawal of contrast agents from their containers should be accomplished under aseptic  conditions with sterile syringes. Sterile techniques must be used with any intravascular injection, and with catheters and guidewires.
Patients should be well hydrated prior to and following ISOVUE (lopamidol Injection) administration. 
As with all radiopaque contrast agents, only the lowest dose of ISOVUE necessary to obtain adequate visualization should be used. A lower dose reduces the possibility of an adverse reaction. Most procedures do not require use of either a maximum dose or the highest available concentration of ISOVUE; the combination of dose and ISOVUE concentration to be used should be carefully individualized, and factors such as age, body size, size of the vessel and its blood flow rate, anticipated pathology and degree and extent of opacification required, structure(s) or area to be examined, disease processes affecting the patient, and equipment and technique to be employed should be considered. 
ISOVUE-300 (lopamidol Injection, 300 mgl/mL) should be used. The usual individual injection by carotid puncture or transfemoral catheterization is 8 to 12 mL, with total multiple doses ranging to 90 mL.
ISOVUE-300 usually provides adequate visualization. For injection into the femoral artery or subclavian artery, 5 to 40 mL may be used; for injection into the aorta for a distal runoff, 25 to 50 mL may be used. Doses up to a total of 250 mL of ISOVUE-300 have been administered during peripheral arteriography.
ISOVUE-200 (lopamidol Injection, 200 mgl/mL) should be used. The usual dose is 25 to 150 mL per lower extremity. The combined total dose for multiple injections has not exceeded 350 mL.
ISOVUE-370 (lopamidol Injection, 370 mgl/mL) should be used. Doses up to 50 mL may be required for injection into the larger vessels such as the aorta or celiac artery; doses up to 10 mL may be required for injection into the renal arteries. Often, lower doses will be sufficient. The combined total dose for multiple injections has not exceeded 225 mL.
ISOVUE-370 should be used. Pediatric angiocardiography may be performed by injection into a large peripheral vein or by direct catheterization of the heart.
The usual dose range for single injections is provided in the following table:
 
The usual recommended dose for cumulative injections is provided in the following table:
 
ISOVUE-370 should be used. The usual dose for selective coronary artery injections is 2 to 10 mL. The usual dose for ventriculography, or for nonselective opacification of multiple coronary arteries following injection at the aortic root is 25 to 50 mL. The total dose for combined procedures has not exceeded 200 mL. EKG monitoring is essential.
ISOVUE-250, ISOVUE-300 or ISOVUE-370 may be used. The usual adult dose for ISOVUE250 is 50 to 100 mL, for ISOVUE-300 is 50 mL and for ISOVUE-370 is 40 mL administered by rapid intravenous injection.
ISOVUE-250 or ISOVUE-300 may be used. The dosage recommended for use in children for excretory urography is 1.2 mL/kg to 3.6 mL/kg for ISOVUE-250 and 1.0 mL/kg to 3.0 mL/kg for ISOVUE-300. It should not be necessary to exceed a total dose of 30 grams of iodine.
ISOVUE-250 or ISOVUE-300 may be used. CECT OF THE HEAD: The suggested dose for ISOVUE-250 is 130 to 240 mL and for ISOVUE300 is 100 to 200 mL by intravenous administration. Imaging may be performed immediately after completion of administration.
CECT OF THE BODY: The usual adult dose range for ISOVUE-250 is 130 to 240 mL and for ISOVUE-300 is 100 to 200 mL administered by rapid intravenous infusion or bolus injection. Equivalent doses of ISOVUE-370 based on organically bound iodine content may also be used. The total dose for either CECT procedure should not exceed 60 grams of iodine.
ISOVUE-250 or ISOVUE-300 may be used. The dosage recommended for use in children for contrast enhanced computed tomography is 1.2 mL/kg to 3.6 mL/kg for ISOVUE-250 and 1.0 mL/kg to 3.0 mL/kg for ISOVUE-300. It should not be necessary to exceed a total dose of 30 grams of iodine.
Many radiopaque contrast agents are incompatible in vitro with some antihistamines and many other drugs; therefore, no other pharmaceuticals should be admixed with contrast agents.
