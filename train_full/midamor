MIDAMOR (amiloride)  should be administered with food.
In treating patients with congestive heart failure after an initial diuresis has been achieved, potassium loss may also decrease and the need for MIDAMOR (amiloride)  should be re- evaluated. Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Maintenance therapy may be on an intermittent basis. 
If it is necessary to use MIDAMOR (amiloride)  alone (see INDICATIONS), the starting dosage should be one 5 mg tablet daily. This dosage may be increased to 10 mg per day, if necessary. More than two 5 mg tablets usually are not needed, and there is little controlled experience with such doses. If persistent hypokalemia is documented with 10 mg, the dose can be increased to 15 mg, then 20 mg, with careful monitoring of electrolytes.
