It is recommended that treatment starts with TAZORAC® Cream, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm²) of TAZORAC® Cream once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the cream. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of TAZORAC® Cream. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of TAZORAC® Cream to these areas should be carefully avoided.
Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm²) of TAZORAC® Cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area.
TAZORAC® Cream is for topical use only. TAZORAC® Cream is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.
