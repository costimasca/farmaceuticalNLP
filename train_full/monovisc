The Monovisc™ device is a proprietary high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) visco-supplementation intended for the treatment of pain in patients with moderate osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee who have failed conservative non-pharmacological therapy and simple analgesics. The device is administered by a single injection via the para-patellar approach under sterile conditions. The dosage delivered by the single injection is equivalent to three injections of Anika's FDA approved (P030019) Orthovisc HA product.
Sodium hyaluronate is a natural complex sugar of the glycosaminoglycan family. The sodium hyaluronate polymer consists of repeating disaccharide units of sodium glucuronate-N-acetylglucosamine. The molecular weight range of hyaluronic acid in Monovisc™ is between 1 and 2.9 million Daltons. Monovisc™ has a nominal sodium hyaluronate concentration of 22 mg/mL, dissolved in physiologic   saline. It is supplied in a 5.0 mL syringe containing 4.0 mL of Monovisc™ The contents of the syringe are sterile, non-pyrogenic and non-inflammatory.
Monovisc™ is prepared by cross-linking hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA) with proprietary cross-linking agent. The HA is derived from bacterial fermentation (Streptococcus equi). The HA used in Monovisc™ is the same grade and specification that is used in Orthovisc®  (P030019), and delivers a comparable amount of HA to the 3-injection Orthovisc®  regimen.
Each pre-filled syringe with 4 mL of Monovisc™ contains:
 
Monovisc™ is injected into the knee joint and is administered as a single intra-articular injection. Standard intra-articular injection site preparation and precautions should be used. Strict aseptic  administration technique must be followed.
