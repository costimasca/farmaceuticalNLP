Potassium Acetate Injection, USP is administered intravenously only after    dilution in a larger volume of fluid. The dose and rate of administration    are dependent upon the individual needs of the patient. ECG and serum potassium    should be monitored as a guide to dosage. Using aseptic technique, all or part    of the contents of one or more vials may be added to other intravenous fluids    to provide any desired number of milliequivalents (mEq) of potassium (K+)    with an equal number of milli- equivalents of acetate (CH3COO–).
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discolouration prior to administration, whenever solution and container    permit. See PRECAUTIONS.
