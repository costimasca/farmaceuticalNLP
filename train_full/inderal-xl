INDERAL XL should be administered once daily at bedtime and should be taken consistently either on an empty stomach or with food. Initiate dosing at 80 mg and titrate to 120 mg daily as needed for blood pressure control. Doses above 120 mg have no additional effects on blood pressure [see Clinical Studies]. The time needed for full antihypertensive response is variable, but is usually achieved within 2 to 3 weeks.
