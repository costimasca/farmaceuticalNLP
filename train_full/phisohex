pHisoHex must not be used for bathing infants (see WARNINGS). Infants may absorb the active compound in pHisoHex more readily than older children and adults. Such absorption has been associated with central nervous system effects such as convulsions.
See WARNINGS.
Use of baby skin products containing alcohol may decrease the antibacterial action of pHisoHex.
