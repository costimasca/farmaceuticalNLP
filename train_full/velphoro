Velphoro tablets must be chewed and not swallowed whole. To aid with chewing and swallowing, the tablets may be crushed.
The recommended starting dose of Velphoro is 3 tablets (1,500 mg) per day, administered as 1 tablet (500 mg) 3 times daily with meals.
Monitor serum phosphorus levels and titrate the dose of Velphoro in decrements or increments of 500 mg (1 tablet) per day as needed until an acceptable serum phosphorus level is reached, with regular monitoring afterwards. Titrate as often as weekly.
Based on clinical studies, on average patients required 3 to 4 tablets (1,500 mg to 2,000 mg) a day to control serum phosphorus levels.
The highest daily dose studied in a Phase 3 clinical trial in ESRD patients was 6 tablets (3,000 mg) per day.
Velphoro must be administered with meals. To maximize the dietary phosphate binding, distribute the total daily dose among meals. No additional fluid above the amount usually taken by the patient is required.
If one or more doses of Velphoro are missed, the medication should be resumed with the next meal. Do not attempt to replace a missed dose.
