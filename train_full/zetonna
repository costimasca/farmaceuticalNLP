Administer ZETONNA by the intranasal route only. Prior to initial use, ZETONNA must be primed by actuating three times. If ZETONNA is not used for ten consecutive days, it must be primed by actuating three times. If ZETONNA is dropped, the canister and actuator may become separated. If this happens, reassemble ZETONNA and test spray once into the air before using. Illustrated patient's instructions for proper use accompany each package of ZETONNA.
Adults and Adolescents (12 Years of Age and Older): The recommended dose of ZETONNA is 1 actuation per nostril once daily (37 mcg per actuation). The maximum total daily dosage should not exceed 1 actuation in each nostril (74 mcg per day).
