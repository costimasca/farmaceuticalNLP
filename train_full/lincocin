If significant diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibacterial should be discontinued. (See WARNING box.)
Intramuscular - Adults: Serious infections—600 mg (2 mL) intramuscularly every 24 hours. More severe infections—600 mg (2 mL) intramuscularly every 12 hours or more often. Pediatric patients over 1 month of age: Serious infections—one intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 24 hours. More severe infections— one intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 12 hours or more often.
Intravenous - Adults: The intravenous dose will be determined by the severity of the infection. For serious infections doses of 600 mg of lincomycin (2 mL of LINCOCIN) to 1 gram are given every 8 to 12 hours. For more severe infections these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations daily intravenous doses of as much as 8 grams have been given. Intravenous doses are given on the basis of 1 gram of lincomycin diluted in not less than 100 mL of appropriate solution (see Physical Compatibilities) and infused over a period of not less than one hour.
 
These doses may be repeated as often as required to the limit of the maximum recommended daily dose of 8 grams of lincomycin.
Pediatric patients over 1 month of age: 10 to 20 mg/kg/day (5 to 10 mg/lb/day) depending on the severity of the infection may be infused in divided doses as described above for adults. NOTE: Severe cardiopulmonary reactions have occurred when this drug has been given at greater than the recommended concentration and rate.
Subconjunctival Injection - 0.25 mL (75 mg) injected subconjunctivally will result in  ocular fluid levels of antibacterial (lasting for at least 5 hours) with MICs sufficient for most susceptible pathogens.
Patients with diminished renal function: When therapy with LINCOCIN is required in individuals with severe impairment of renal function, an appropriate dose is 25 to 30% of that recommended for patients with normally functioning kidneys.
