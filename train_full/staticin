STATICIN (erythromycin topical solution 1.5%)  Solution should be applied over the affected area twice a day after    the skin is thoroughly washed with warm water and soap and patted dry. Acne    lesions on the face, neck, shoulder, chest, and back may be treated in this    manner.
This medication should be applied with applicator top. If fingertips are used,    wash hands after application. Drying and peeling may be controlled by reducing    the frequency of applications.
