For intralesional injection only. Do not administer intravenously. 
Administer IMLYGIC by injection into cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or nodal lesions that are visible, palpable, or detectable by ultrasound guidance.
IMLYGIC is provided in single-use vials of 1 mL each in two different dose strengths:
The total injection volume for each treatment visit should not exceed 4 mL for all injected lesions combined. It may not be possible to inject all lesions at each treatment visit or over the full course of treatment. Previously injected and/or uninjected lesion(s) may be injected at subsequent treatment visits. The initial recommended dose is up to 4 mL of IMLYGIC at a concentration of 106 (1 million) PFU per mL. The recommended dose for subsequent administrations is up to 4 mL of IMLYGIC at a concentration of 108 (100 million) PFU per mL. The recommended dosing schedule for IMLYGIC is shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Recommended Dose and Schedule for IMLYGIC 
Use Table 2 to determine the volume of IMLYGIC injection for each lesion.
Table 2. Determination of IMLYGIC Injection Volume Based on Lesion Size 
When lesions are clustered together, inject them as a single lesion according to Table 2.
Continue IMLYGIC treatment for at least 6 months unless other treatment is required or until there are no injectable lesions to treat.
Reinitiate IMLYGIC treatment if new unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal lesions appear after a complete response.
Healthcare providers who are immunocompromised or pregnant should not prepare or administer IMLYGIC and should not come into direct contact with the IMLYGIC injection sites, dressings, or body fluids of treated patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Avoid accidental exposure to IMLYGIC and follow universal biohazard precautions for preparation, administration, and handling of IMLYGIC:
