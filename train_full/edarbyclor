The recommended starting dose of Edarbyclor is 40/12.5 mg taken orally once daily. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 1 to 2 weeks. The dosage may be increased to 40/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks as needed to achieve blood pressure goals. Edarbyclor doses above 40/25 mg are probably not useful.
Edarbyclor may be used to provide additional blood pressure lowering for patients not adequately controlled on ARB or diuretic monotherapy treatment. Patients not controlled with azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg may have an additional systolic / diastolic clinic blood pressure reduction of 13/6 mm Hg when switched to Edarbyclor 40/12.5 mg. Patients not controlled with chlorthalidone 25 mg may have an additional clinic blood pressure reduction of 10/7 mm Hg when switched to Edarbyclor 40/12.5 mg.
Edarbyclor may be used as initial therapy if a patient is likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals.
Patients titrated to the individual components (azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone) may instead receive the corresponding dose of Edarbyclor.
Edarbyclor may be taken with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Edarbyclor may be administered with other antihypertensive agents as needed.
Correct any volume depletion prior to administration of Edarbyclor, particularly in patients with impaired renal function or those treated with high doses of diuretics [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on chlorthalidone may be switched to Edarbyclor, initially with a lower dose of chlorthalidone [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
As Edarbyclor is moisture sensitive, dispense and store Edarbyclor in its original container to protect Edarbyclor from light and moisture.
