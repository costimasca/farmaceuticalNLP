Apply a few drops of DIPROLENE Lotion to the affected skin areas once or twice daily and massage lightly until the lotion disappears.
Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary. DIPROLENE Lotion is a super-high-potency topical corticosteroid. Treatment with DIPROLENE Lotion should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and amounts should not exceed 50 mL per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
DIPROLENE Lotion should not be used with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.
DIPROLENE Lotion is for topical use only. It is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. 
Avoid use on the face, groin, or axillae, or if skin atrophy is present at the treatment site.
