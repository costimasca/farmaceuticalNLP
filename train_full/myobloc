The recommended initial dose of MYOBLOC (botulinum toxin type b)  for patients with a prior history of    tolerating botulinum toxin injections is 2,500 to 5,000 Units divided among    affected muscles (see Clinical Studies). Patients without a prior history    of tolerating botulinum toxin injections should receive a lower initial dose.    Subsequent dosing should be optimized according to the patient's individual    response. MYOBLOC (botulinum toxin type b)  should be administered by physicians familiar and experienced    in the assessment and management of patients with CD.
The method described for performing the potency assay is specific to Solstice Neurosciences' manufacture of MYOBLOC (botulinum toxin type b) . Due to differences in the specific details of this assay such as the vehicle, dilution scheme and laboratory protocols for various potency assays, Units of biological activity of MYOBLOC (botulinum toxin type b)  cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin or any toxin assessed with any other specific assay method. Therefore, differences in species' sensitivities to different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes preclude extrapolation of animal dose-activity relationships to human dose estimates.
The duration of effect in patients responding to MYOBLOC (botulinum toxin type b)  treatment has been    observed in studies to be between 12 and 16 weeks at doses of 5,000 Units or    10,000 Units (see Clinical Studies).
