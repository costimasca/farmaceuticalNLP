Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for extraneous particulate    matter and/or discoloration prior to administration. If these conditions exist,    Mumps Skin Test Antigen should not be administered.
SHAKE VIAL WELL before withdrawing each dose.
A separate, sterile syringe and needle or a sterile disposable unit should    be used for each patient to prevent transmission of hepatitis or other infectious    agents from person to person. Needles should not be recapped and should be disposed    of according to biohazard waste guidelines.
An injection of 0.1 mL of the antigen is made on the inner surface of the forearm.    Before injection, the skin over the site to be injected should be cleansed with    a suitable germicide. Care should be taken to inject the test antigen intradermally.
Interpretation of Reactions - The reaction should be examined in 48    to 72 hours. A mean diameter (i.e., the longest width plus the longest length,    divided by 2) of induration of 5 mm or more indicates a positive DH reaction    to the antigen. A negative reaction, if the test dose has been given correctly,    usually indicates either anergy or nonsensitivity. Pseudopositive reactions    may develop in persons highly sensitive to egg protein.
