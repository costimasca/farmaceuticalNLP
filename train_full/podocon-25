PODOCON-25速 (podophyllin)  IS TO BE APPLIED ONLY BY A PHYSICIAN. IT IS NOT TO BE DISPENSED    TO THE PATIENT. SHAKE WELL.
Thoroughly cleanse affected area. Use supplied applicator to apply Podocon-25速 (podophyllin)     sparingly to lesion. Avoid contact with healthy tissue. Allow to dry    thoroughly. Only intact (no bleeding) lesions should be treated. As podophyllin    is a powerful caustic and severe irritant, it is recommended the first application    of Podocon-25速 (podophyllin)  be left in contact for only a short time (30-40 minutes)    to determine patient's sensitivity. To avoid systemic absorption, time of contact    should be minimum time necessary to produce the desired result (1 to 4 hours,    depending on condition of lesion and of patient), the physician developing his/her    own experience and technique. Large areas or numerous warts should not be treated    at once.
After treatment time has elapsed, remove dried Podocon-25速 (podophyllin)  thoroughly    with alcohol or soap and water.
