Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.
A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
PREMARIN Vaginal Cream is administered intravaginally in a cyclic regimen (daily for 21 days and then off for 7 days). Generally, women should be started at the 0.5 g dosage strength. Dosage adjustments (0.5 to 2 g) may be made based on individual response [see Dosage Forms And Strengths].
PREMARIN Vaginal Cream (0.5 g) is administered intravaginally in a twice-weekly (for example, Monday and Thursday) continuous regimen or in a cyclic regimen of 21 days of therapy followed by 7 days off of therapy [see Dosage Forms And Strengths].
