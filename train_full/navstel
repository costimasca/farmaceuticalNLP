 
If preferred, the contents of the NAVSTEL® (balanced salt ophthalmic solution)  Part II  component may be aspirated with an 18-gauge cannula attached to a 20 mL syringe and then transferred into the Part I bottle.
After reconstitution, use a single patient administration  set with an air-inlet in the plastic spike since the bottle does not contain a separate airway tube.  Follow the directions for  the particular administration set to be used.  Insert the spike aseptically into the bottle through the center target area of the rubber stopper.  Allow the fluid to flow to remove air from the tubing before intraocular irrigation begins.  If a second bottle  is necessary to complete the surgical procedure, insure that the vacuum is vented from the second bottle BEFORE attachment   to the administration set.
NAVSTEL® (balanced salt ophthalmic solution)  Solution is supplied in two sizes, 250 mL  and 500 mL.  Each size consists of two packages for reconstitution prior to use: 250 mL size consists of a 250 mL   glass bottle containing 240 mL (Part I) and a 10 mL glass vial (Part II); both using grey butyl stoppers and aluminum seals    with polypropylene flip-off caps; 500 mL size consists of a    500 mL glass bottle containing 480 mL (Part I) and a 20 mL  glass vial (Part II); both using grey butyl stoppers and aluminum seals with polypropylene flip-off caps.
