Screen for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with ZIAGEN [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended dosage of ZIAGEN for adults is 600 mg daily, administered orally as either 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
The recommended dosage of ZIAGEN oral solution in HIV-1-infected pediatric patients aged 3 months and older is 8 mg per kg orally twice daily or 16 mg per kg orally once-daily (up to a maximum of 600 mg daily) in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
ZIAGEN is also available as a scored tablet for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 14 kg for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate. Before prescribing ZIAGEN tablets, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow ZIAGEN tablets, the oral solution formulation should be prescribed. The recommended oral dosage of ZIAGEN tablets for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients is presented in Table 1.
Table 1: Dosing Recommendations for ZIAGEN Scored Tablets in Pediatric Patients 
The recommended dose of ZIAGEN in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) is 200 mg twice daily. To enable dose reduction, ZIAGEN oral solution (10 mL twice daily) should be used for the treatment of these patients. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment; therefore, ZIAGEN is contraindicated in these patients.
