The initial dose of Kerlone (betaxolol hydrochloride)  in hypertension is ordinarily 10 mg once daily    either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full antihypertensive effect    is usually seen within 7 to 14 days. If the desired response is not achieved    the dose can be doubled after 7 to 14 days. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg    has not been shown to produce a statistically significant additional antihypertensive    effect; but the 40-mg dose has been studied and is well tolerated. An increased    effect (reduction) on heart rate should be anticipated with increasing dosage.    If monotherapy with Kerlone (betaxolol hydrochloride)  does not produce the desired response, the addition    of a diuretic agent or other antihypertensive should be considered (see, DRUG    INTERACTIONS).
Patients with renal failure: In patients with renal impairment,   clearance of betaxolol declines with decreasing renal function.
In patients with severe renal impairment and those undergoing dialysis the initial dose of Kerlone (betaxolol hydrochloride)  is 5 mg once daily. If the desired response is not achieved, dosage may be increased by 5 mg/day increments every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 20 mg/day.
Patients with hepatic disease: Patients with hepatic disease   do not have significantly altered clearance. Dosage adjustments are not routinely   needed.
Elderly patients: Consideration should be given to reduction   in the starting dose to 5 mg in elderly patients. These patients are especially   prone to beta-blocker-induced bradycardia, which appears to be dose related   and sometimes responds to reductions in dose.
Cessation of therapy: If withdrawal of Kerlone (betaxolol hydrochloride)  therapy is planned,   it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should   be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum.
