Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.    Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed    during storage at temperatures lower than recommended.
DEPO-Estradiol (estradiol cypionate injection)  INJECTION IS FOR INTRAMUSCULAR USE ONLY.
When estrogen is prescribed for a woman with a uterus, progestin should also    be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus    does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin,    should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent    with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be    reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month    intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary. (See Boxed    Warnings  and WARNINGS.) For women    who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling,    when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed    persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.
