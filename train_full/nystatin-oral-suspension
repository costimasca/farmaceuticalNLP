Infants: 2 mL (200,000 units) four times daily (in infants and young children, use dropper to place one-half of dose in each side of mouth and avoid feeding for 5 to 10 minutes). NOTE: Limited clinical studies in premature and low birth weight infants indicate that 1 mL four times daily is effective.
Children and Adults: 4â€“6 mL (400,000 to 600,000 units) four times daily (one-half of dose in each side of mouth). The preparation should be retained in the mouth as long as possible before swallowing.
Continue treatment for at least 48 hours after perioral symptoms have disappeared and cultures demonstrate eradication of Candida albicans.
