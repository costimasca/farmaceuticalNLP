The recommended dosage of NUVIGIL for patients with OSA or narcolepsy is 150 mg to 250 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose in the morning.
In patients with OSA, doses up to 250 mg/day, given as a single dose, have been well tolerated, but there is no consistent evidence that these doses confer additional benefit beyond that of the 150 mg/day dose [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and Clinical Studies].
The recommended dosage of NUVIGIL for patients with SWD is 150 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose approximately 1 hour prior to the start of their work shift.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the dosage of NUVIGIL should be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Consideration should be given to the use of lower doses and close monitoring in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations].
