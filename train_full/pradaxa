 
For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl)  > 30 mL/min, the recommended dose of PRADAXA is 150 mg taken orally, twice daily. For patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min), the recommended dose of PRADAXA is 75 mg twice daily [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl  < 15 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided.
For patients with CrCl  > 30 mL/min, the recommended dose of PRADAXA is 150 mg taken orally, twice daily, after 5-10 days of parenteral anticoagulation. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl  ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
For patients with CrCl  > 30 mL/min, the recommended dose of PRADAXA is 150 mg taken orally, twice daily after previous treatment. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl  ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
For patients with CrCl  > 30 mL/min, the recommended dose of PRADAXA is 110 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery and after  hemostasis has been achieved, then 220 mg taken once daily for 28-35 days. If PRADAXA is not started on the day of surgery, after hemostasis has been achieved initiate treatment with 220 mg once daily. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl  ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Assess renal function prior to initiation of treatment with PRADAXA. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in clinical situations that may be associated with a decline in renal function) and adjust therapy accordingly. Discontinue PRADAXA in patients who develop acute renal failure while on PRADAXA and consider alternative anticoagulant therapy.
Generally, the extent of anticoagulation does not need to be assessed. When necessary, use aPTT or ECT, and not INR, to assess for anticoagulant activity in patients on PRADAXA [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min), concomitant use of the P-gp inhibitor dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole can be expected to produce dabigatran exposure similar to that observed in severe renal impairment. Reduce the dose of PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Dosing recommendations for patients with CrCl  ≤ 30 mL/min cannot be provided. Avoid use of concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl  < 50 mL/min [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Dosing recommendations for patients with CrCl  ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided. Avoid use of concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl  < 50 mL/min [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Instruct patients to swallow the capsules whole. PRADAXA should be taken with a full glass of water. Breaking, chewing, or emptying the contents of the capsule can result in increased exposure [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If a dose of PRADAXA is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day; the missed dose should be skipped if it cannot be taken at least 6 hours before the next scheduled dose. The dose of PRADAXA should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.
When converting patients from warfarin therapy to PRADAXA, discontinue warfarin and start PRADAXA when the INR is below 2.0.
When converting from PRADAXA to warfarin, adjust the starting time of warfarin based on creatinine clearance as follows:
Because PRADAXA can increase INR, the INR will better reflect warfarin's effect only after PRADAXA has been stopped for at least 2 days [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
For patients currently receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, start PRADAXA 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of the parenteral drug was to have been administered or at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral drug (e.g., intravenous unfractionated heparin).
For patients currently taking PRADAXA, wait 12 hours (CrCl  ≥ 30 mL/min) or 24 hours (CrCl  < 30 mL/min) after the last dose of PRADAXA before initiating treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If possible, discontinue PRADAXA 1 to 2 days (CrCl  ≥ 50 mL/min) or 3 to 5 days (CrCl  < 50 mL/min) before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Use a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) in case of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed. Refer to the idarucizumab prescribing information for additional information. Restart PRADAXA as soon as medically appropriate.
