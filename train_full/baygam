BayGam (immune globulin)  is administered intramuscularly (see PRECAUTIONS), preferably    in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh and the deltoid muscle of the    upper arm. The gluteal region should not be used routinely as an injection site    because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve. Doses over 10 mL should    be divided and injected into several muscle sites to reduce local pain and discomfort.    An individual decision as to which muscle is injected must be made for each    patient based on the volume of material to be administered. If the gluteal region    is used when very large volumes are to be injected or multiple doses are necessary,    the central region MUST be avoided; only the upper, outer quadrant should be    used.10 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
BayGam (immune globulin)  in a dose of 0.01 mL/lb (0.02 mL/kg) is recommended for household and    institutional hepatitis A case contacts. The following doses of BayGam (immune globulin)  are recommended    for persons who plan to travel in areas where hepatitis A is common.3
  
BayGam (immune globulin)  should be given in a dose of 0.11 mL/lb (0.25 mL/kg) to prevent or modify    measles in a susceptible person exposed fewer than 6 days previously.7    A susceptible child who is exposed to measles and who is immunocompromised    should receive a dose of 0.5 mL/kg (maximum dose, 15 mL) of BayGam (immune globulin)  immediately.8
If Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin (Human) is unavailable, BayGam (immune globulin)  at a dose    of 0.6 to 1.2 mL/kg, promptly given, may also modify varicella.5
Some studies suggest that the use of BayGam (immune globulin)  in exposed, susceptible women can    lessen the likelihood of infection and fetal damage; therefore, BayGam (immune globulin)  at a    dose of 0.55 mL/kg may benefit those women who will not consider a therapeutic abortion.4
BayGam (immune globulin)  may prevent serious infection in patients with immunoglobulin deficiencies    if circulating IgG levels of approximately 200 mg/100 mL plasma are maintained.    The recommended dosage is 0.66 mL/kg (at least 100 mg/kg) given every 3 to 4    weeks.6 A double dose is given at onset of therapy; some patients    may require more frequent injections.
