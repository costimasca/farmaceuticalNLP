The recommended dose for HyperRAB S/D is 20 IU/kg (0.133 mL/kg) of body weight given preferably at the time of the first vaccine dose.8,9 It may also be given through the seventh day after the first dose of vaccine is given. If anatomically feasible, up to the full dose of HyperRAB S/D should be thoroughly infiltrated in the area around the wound and the rest should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.26 HyperRAB S/D should never be administered in the same syringe or needle or in the same anatomical site as vaccine.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
