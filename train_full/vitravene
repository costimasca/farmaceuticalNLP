Treatment with Vitravene (fomivirsen) † involves an induction and a maintenance phase. The recommended dose of Vitravene (fomivirsen) † is 330 µg (0.05 mL). The induction dose of Vitravene (fomivirsen) † should be one injection every other week for two doses. Subsequent maintenance doses should be administered once every four weeks after induction. 
For unacceptable inflammation in the face of controlled CMVR, it is worthwhile interrupting therapy until the level of inflammation decreases and therapy can resume. 
For patients whose disease progresses on Vitravene (fomivirsen) † during maintenance, an attempt at reinduction at the same dose may result in resumed disease control. 
Vitravene (fomivirsen) † is administered by intravitreal injection (0.05 mL/eye) into the affected eye following application of standard topical and/or local anesthetics and antimicrobials using a 30 gauge needle on a low-volume (e.g., tuberculin) syringe. The following steps should be used: 
  

Monitor light perception and optic nerve head perfusion: if not completely perfused by 7-10 minutes, perform anterior chamber paracentesis with a 30 gauge needle on a plungerless tuberculin syringe at the slit lamp.
