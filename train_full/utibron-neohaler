For oral inhalation only. Do not swallow UTIBRON capsules, as the intended effects on the lungs will not be obtained. UTIBRON capsules should only be used with the NEOHALER device [see OVERDOSAGE].
The recommended dosage of UTIBRON NEOHALER is the inhalation of the contents of one UTIBRON capsule twice-daily using the NEOHALER device.
UTIBRON NEOHALER should be administered at the same time of the day (1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening) every day. More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 capsule twice-daily) of UTIBRON NEOHALER is not recommended.
Store UTIBRON capsules in the blister, and only remove IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USE with the NEOHALER device.
No dosage adjustment is required for geriatric patients, patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, or patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
