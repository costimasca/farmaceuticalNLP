Tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.
Tablets should be taken with food.
HORIZANT is not interchangeable with other gabapentin products because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended dosage for HORIZANT is 600 mg once daily at about 5 PM. A daily dose of 1,200 mg provided no additional benefit compared with the 600-mg dose, but caused an increase in adverse reactions [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
If the dose is not taken at the recommended time, the next dose should be taken the following day as prescribed.
The recommended dosage of HORIZANT is 600 mg twice daily. HORIZANT should be initiated at a dose of 600 mg in the morning for 3 days of therapy, then increased to 600 mg twice daily (1,200 mg/day) on day four. In the 12-week principal efficacy study, additional benefit of using doses greater than 1,200 mg a day was not demonstrated, and these higher doses resulted in an increase in adverse reactions [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
If the dose is not taken at the recommended time, skip this dose, and the next dose should be taken at the time of the next scheduled dose.
Dosing of HORIZANT is adjusted in accordance with renal function, as represented by creatinine clearance [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Target dose regimens are listed in Table 1 and Table 2.

In patients with stable renal function, CrCl can be estimated using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault:
for males: CrCl = (140-age)(weight)/[(72)(SCr)]
for females: CrCl = (0.85)(140-age)(weight)/[(72)(SCr)]
where age is in years, weight is in kilograms, and SCr is serum creatinine in mg/dL.
