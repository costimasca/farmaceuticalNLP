Mirena contains 52 mg of levonorgestrel (LNG). Initially, LNG is released at a rate of approximately 20 mcg/day. This rate decreases progressively to half that value after 5 years.
Mirena must be removed by the end of the fifth year and can be replaced at the time of removal with a new Mirena if continued contraceptive protection is desired.
Mirena is supplied within an inserter in a sterile package (see Figure 1) that must not be opened until required for insertion [see DESCRIPTION]. Do not use if the seal of the sterile package is broken or appears compromised. Use strict aseptic techniques throughout the insertion procedure [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
