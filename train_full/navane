Dosage of Navane (thiothixene hcl)  should be individually adjusted depending on the chronicity and severity of the symptoms of schizophrenia. In general, small doses should be used initially and gradually increased to the optimal effective level, based on patient response.
Some patients have been successfully maintained on once-a-day Navane (thiothixene hcl)  therapy.
The use of Navane (thiothixene hcl)  in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established.
In milder conditions, an initial dose of 2 mg three times daily is recommended. If indicated, a subsequent increase to 15 mg/day total daily dose is often effective.
In more severe conditions, an initial dose of 5 mg twice daily is recommended.
The usual optimal dose is 20 to 30 mg daily. If indicated, an increase to 60 mg/day total daily dose is often effective. Exceeding a total daily dose of 60 mg rarely increases the beneficial response.
