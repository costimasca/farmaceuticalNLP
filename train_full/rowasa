ROWASA速 (mesalamine) Rectal Suspension Enema is for rectal use only.
Patients should be instructed to shake the bottle well to make sure the suspension    is homogeneous. The patient should remove the protective sheath from the applicator    tip. Holding the bottle at the neck will not cause any of the medication to    be discharged. The position most often used is obtained by lying on the left    side (to facilitate migration into the sigmoid colon); with the lower leg extended    and the upper right leg flexed forward for balance. An alternative is the knee-    chest position. The applicator tip should be gently inserted in the rectum pointing    toward the umbilicus. A steady squeezing of the bottle will discharge most of    the preparation. The preparation should be taken at bedtime with the objective    of retaining it all night. Patient instructions are included with every seven    units.
