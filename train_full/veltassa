Administer Veltassa at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after other oral medications [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Administer Veltassa with food. Do not heat Veltassa (e.g., microwave) or add to heated foods or liquids. Do not take Veltassa in its dry form.
The recommended starting dose of Veltassa is 8.4 grams patiromer once daily. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of Veltassa based on the serum potassium level and the desired target range. The dose may be increased or decreased, as necessary, to reach the desired serum potassium concentration, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 grams once daily. The dose can be up-titrated based on serum potassium level at 1-week or longer intervals, in increments of 8.4 grams.
Prepare each dose immediately prior to administration.
Measure 1/3 cup of water. Pour half of the water into a glass, then add Veltassa and stir. Add the remaining half of the water and stir thoroughly. The powder will not dissolve and the mixture will look cloudy. Add more water to the mixture as needed for desired consistency.
Drink the mixture immediately. If powder remains in the glass after drinking, add more water, stir and drink immediately. Repeat as needed to ensure the entire dose is administered.
