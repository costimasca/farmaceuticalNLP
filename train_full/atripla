Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with body weight at least 40 kg (at least 88 lbs)
The dose of ATRIPLA is one tablet once daily taken orally on an empty stomach. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of nervous system symptoms.
Because ATRIPLA is a fixed-dose combination, it should not be prescribed for patients requiring dosage adjustment such as those with moderate or severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min).
When ATRIPLA is administered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg/day of efavirenz is recommended [See DRUG INTERACTIONS, Table 3, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Table 4].
