The recommended dose is 50 mg every 4 to 6 hours. Doses of 100 mg may be needed    in some patients for optimal pain relief (see CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY). However, the daily dose should not exceed 400 mg (see    ADVERSE REACTIONS).
The recommended dose of meclofenamate sodium is 100 mg three times a day, for    up to six days, starting at the onset of menstrual flow.
For rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (including acute exacerbations of chronic disease) The dosage is 200 to 400 mg per day, administered in three or four equal doses.
Therapy should be initiated at the lower dosage, then increased as necessary to improve clinical response. The dosage should be individually adjusted for each patient, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the clinical response. The daily dosage should not exceed 400 mg per day. The smallest dosage of meclofenamate sodium that yields clinical control should be employed.
Although improvement may be seen in some patients in a few days, two to three weeks of treatment may be required to obtain the optimum therapeutic benefit.
After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage should be adjusted as required. A lower dosage may suffice for long-term administration.
If gastrointestinal complaints occur (see WARNINGS    and PRECAUTIONS), meclofenamate sodium may    be administered with meals or with milk (see CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY for a description of food effects). If intolerance occurs,    the dosage may need to be reduced. Therapy should be terminated if any severe    adverse reactions occur.
