The recommended dose is one drop of ZIOPTAN in the  conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
The dose should not exceed once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may lessen the  intraocular pressure lowering effect.
Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 2 to 4 hours after the first administration with the maximum effect reached after 12 hours.
ZIOPTAN may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic product is being used, each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.
The solution from one individual unit is to be used immediately after opening for administration to one or both eyes. Since sterility cannot be maintained after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.
