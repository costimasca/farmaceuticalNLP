Prompt institution of appropriate measures for controlling shock and pain is of prime importance. The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided, and SULFAMYLON Cream is applied with a sterile gloved hand. Satisfactory results can be achieved with application of the cream once or twice daily, to a thickness of approximately 1/16 inch; thicker application is not recommended. The burned areas should be covered with SULFAMYLON Cream at all times. Therefore, whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to any areas from which it has been removed (e.g., by patient activity). The routine of administration can be accomplished in minimal time, since dressings usually are not required, if individual patient demands make them necessary, however, only a thin layer of dressings should be used.
When feasible, the patient should be bathed daily to aid in debridement. A whirlpool bath is particularly helpful, but the patient may be bathed in bed or in a shower.
The duration of therapy with SULFAMYLON Cream depends on each patient's requirements. Treatment is usually continued until healing is progressing well or until the burn site is ready for grafting. SULFAMYLON Cream should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there is the possibility of infection. However, if allergic manifestations occur during treatment with SULFAMYLON Cream, discontinuation of treatment should be considered.
If acidosis occurs and becomes difficult to control, particularly in patients with pulmonary dysfunction, discontinuing therapy SULFAMYLON Cream for 24 to 48 hours while continuing fluid therapy may aid in restoring acid-base balance.
