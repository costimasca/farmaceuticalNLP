The usual starting dose of ATROVENT HFA is two inhalations four times a day. Patients may take additional inhalations as required; however, the total number of inhalations should not exceed 12 in 24 hours.
ATROVENT HFA is a solution aerosol that does not require shaking. However, as with any other metered-dose inhaler, some coordination is required between actuating the canister and inhaling the medication.
Patients should “prime” or actuate ATROVENT HFA before using for the first time by releasing 2 test sprays into the air away from the face. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 3 days, prime the inhaler again by releasing 2 test sprays into the air away from the face. Patients should avoid spraying ATROVENT HFA into their eyes.
Each inhaler provides sufficient medication for 200 actuations. The inhaler should be discarded after the labeled number of actuations has been used. The amount of medication in each actuation cannot be assured after this point, even though the canister is not completely empty.
Patients should be instructed on the proper use of their inhaler [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
