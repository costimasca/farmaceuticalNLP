For Intravenous Use Only
Adjust the dosage of DigiFab® according to the amount of digoxin to be neutralized.
Summary Of Dosing Guidelines 
Failure of the patient to respond to DigiFab® should alert the physician to the possibility that the clinical problem may not be caused by digitalis toxicity.
Methods for calculating a neutralizing dose of DigiFab®, based on a known or estimated amount of digoxin or digitoxin in the body, are provided below. When using the dose calculation methods provided, the following guidelines should be considered:
Table 1 gives dosage estimates in number of vials for adults and children who have ingested a single large dose of digoxin and for whom the approximate number of tablets or capsules is known. The dose of DigiFab® (in number of vials) represented in Table 1 can be approximated using the following formula:
Dose (in # of vials) = total digitalis body load in mg /0.5 mg of digitalis bound/vial
Table 1 : Approximate Dose of DigiFab® for Reversal of a Single Large Digoxin Overdose 
If, after several hours, toxicity is not adequately reversed, or appears to recur, additional administration of DigiFab® at a dose guided by clinical judgment may be required.
Table 2 gives dosage estimates in number of vials for adult patients for whom a steady-state serum digoxin concentration is known. The dose of DigiFab® (in number of vials) represented in Table 2 can be approximated using the following formula:
Dose (in # of vials) = (Serum digoxin concentration in ng/mL)(weight in kg)/ 100
Table 2 : Adult Dose Estimate of DigiFab® (in # of vials) from Steady-State Serum Digoxin Concentration 
Dose (in mg) = (Dose in # of vials) (40 mg/vial)
Table 3 : Infants and Small ( <  20 Kg) Children Dose Estimates of DigiFab® (in mg) from Steady State Serum Digoxin Concentration 
The dose of DigiFab® for digitoxin toxicity can be approximated by using the following formula (which differs from Formula 2 in the denominator due to a 10-fold decrease in the volume of distribution of digitoxin as compared to digoxin).
Dose (in # of vials) = (Serum digitoxin concentration in ng/mL) (weight in kg)/ 1000
If in any case, the dose estimated based on ingested amount (Formula 1) differs substantially from that calculated based on the serum digoxin or digitoxin concentration (Formulas 2 and 4), it may be preferable to use the higher dose estimate.
