Apply one ZINGO® (0.5 mg lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate) to the site planned for venipuncture or intravenous cannulation, one to three minutes prior to needle insertion. Perform the procedure within 10 minutes after ZINGO® administration.
Use ZINGO® only on intact skin.
Application of one additional ZINGO® at a new location is acceptable after a failed attempt at venous access. Multiple administration of ZINGO® at the same location are not recommended. When ZINGO® is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all sources should be considered, as local anesthetics are thought to have at least additive toxicities.
