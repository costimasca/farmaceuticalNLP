Treatment with cysteamine should be started immediately after diagnosis. The recommended starting dosage of PROCYSBI for cysteamine-naïve patients is 0.2 to 0.3 grams/m2 per day divided into two doses given every 12 hours. Table 1 shows the recommended weight-based starting dosage and the number of capsules needed to achieve each dose. Increase the dosage gradually over 4 to 6 weeks until the maintenance dosage is achieved to help reduce the risk of adverse reactions [see Dose Titration].
Table 1: Recommended Weight-Based Starting Dosage ( to ¼ of maintenance dosage) 
The recommended maintenance dosage of PROCYSBI for cysteamine-naive patients is 1.3 gram/m per day, divided into two equal doses given every 12 hours. Table 2 shows the recommended weight-based maintenance dosage of PROCYSBI and the number of capsules needed to achieve each dose. After maintenance dose has been achieved, measure the white blood cell (WBC) cystine concentration [See Laboratory Monitoring]. Titrate the PROCYSBI dosage as needed to achieve target WBC cystine concentrations [see Dose Titration]. Do not exceed 1.95 grams/m2 per day.
Table 2: Target Weight-Based Maintenance Dosage 
When switching patient from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate to PROCYSBI, starting total daily dose of PROCYSBI is equal to his/her previous total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Measure WBC cystine concentration two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI [See Laboratory Monitoring]. Titrate the PROCYSBI dose as needed to achieve target WBC cystine concentrations [see Dose Titration]. Do not exceed 1.95 grams/m2 per day.
For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, follow the instructions below for administration with food or liquid. Administration of PROCYSBI with foods and liquids not included below has not been studied clinically and is not recommended.
A bolus (straight) feeding tube is recommended.
