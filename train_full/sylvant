SYLVANT 11 mg/kg is given over 1 hour as an intravenous infusion administered every 3 weeks until treatment failure.
Perform hematology laboratory tests prior to each dose of SYLVANT therapy for the first 12 months and every 3 dosing cycles thereafter. If treatment criteria outlined in Table 1 are not met, consider delaying treatment with SYLVANT. Do not reduce dose.
Table 1: Treatment Criteria 
Do not administer SYLVANT to patients with severe infections until the infection resolves.
Discontinue SYLVANT in patients with severe infusion related reactions, anaphylaxis, severe allergic reactions, or cytokine release syndromes. Do not reinstitute treatment.
Use aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solution.
Table 2: Reconstitution Instructions 
Gently swirl the reconstituted vials to aid the dissolution of the lyophilized powder. DO NOT SHAKE or SWIRL VIGOROUSLY. Do not remove the contents until all of the solids have been completely dissolved. The lyophilized powder should dissolve in less than 60 minutes.
Once reconstituted, and prior to further dilution, inspect the vials for particulates and discoloration. Do not use if particles or solution discoloration are present or if visibly opaque. The reconstituted product should be kept for no more than two hours prior to addition into the infusion bag.
