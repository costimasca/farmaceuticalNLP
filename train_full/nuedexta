The recommended starting dose of NUEDEXTA is one capsule daily by mouth for the initial seven days of therapy. On the eighth day of therapy and thereafter, the daily dose should be a total of two capsules a day, given as one capsule every 12 hours.
The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically, as spontaneous improvement of PBA occurs in some patients.
