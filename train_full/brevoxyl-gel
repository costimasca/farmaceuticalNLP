Therapy may be initiated with either Brevoxyl-4 Gel (benzoyl peroxide gel)  or Brevoxyl-8 Gel. The medication should be applied once or twice daily to the affected areas. Frequency of use should be adjusted to obtain the desired clinical response. Gentle cleansing of the affected areas prior to application of Brevoxyl-4 Gel (benzoyl peroxide gel)  or Brevoxyl-8 Gel may be beneficial. Clinically visible improvement will normally occur by the third week of therapy. Maximum lesion reduction may be expected after approximately eight to twelve weeks of drug use.
