ORTHO-CYCLEN and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN are dispensed in either a DIALPAK Tablet dispenser or a VERIDATE Tablet Dispenser [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling]. ORTHO-CYCLEN and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN may be started using either a Day 1 start or a Sunday start (see Table 1). For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, an additional method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.

DIALPAK® Tablet Dispenser: SET THE DAY:
Day 1 Start: turn the dial on the empty DIALPAK until the arrow points to the first day of the patient's period.
Sunday Start: the arrow on the empty DIALPAK should point to SU (Sunday).
Insert the new refill by lining up the “V” shape on the refill with the “V” shape at the top of the DIALPAK. Snap the refill in place. Pill “1” is ready to be taken. Always begin the pill cycle with pill “1,” as shown on the inner part of the refill ring.
 
Remove pill “1” by pushing down on the pill. The pill will come out through a hole in the back of the DIALPAK.
The patient should wait 24 hours to take the next pill. To take pill “2,” turn the dial on the DIALPAK in a clockwise direction to the next day. Continue to take one pill each day until all the pills have been taken.
Turn the dial to the pill “1” position to remove the empty refill and insert a new refill. The first pill in every refill will always be taken on the same day of the week, no matter when the patient's next period starts.

In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking an active tablet, handle this as a missed tablet [see FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].
The timing of initiation of dosing with ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN for acne should follow the guidelines for use of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN as an oral contraceptive. Consult the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section (2.1) for instructions.
