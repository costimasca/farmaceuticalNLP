Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual women. Postmenopausal women should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
One Climara Pro transdermal system is available for use.
Women not currently using continuous estrogen-alone therapy or estrogen plus progestin therapy may start therapy with Climara Pro at any time. However, women currently using continuous estrogen-alone therapy or estrogen plus progestin therapy should complete the current cycle of therapy before initiating Climara Pro therapy. Women often experience withdrawal bleeding at the completion of the cycle. The first day of this bleeding would be an appropriate time to begin Climara Pro therapy.
