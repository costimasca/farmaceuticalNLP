Cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor: It is recommended that Ketoconazole Cream 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment. Seborrheic dermatitis: Ketoconazole Cream 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until clinical clearing.
If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined.
