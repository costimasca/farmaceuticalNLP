Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Sodium nitroprusside should be a clear colorless to red/brown color; do not use if solution is blue, green, or bright red.
Continuously monitor blood pressure in patients receiving sodium nitroprusside. Start infusion of sodium nitroprusside at a rate of 0.3 mcg/kg/min. Evaluate blood pressure for at least 5 minutes before titrating to a higher or lower dose to achieve the desired blood pressure. The dose may be titrated upward until:
In patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, limit the mean infusion rate to less than 3 mcg/kg/min. In anuric patients, limit the mean infusion rate to 1 mcg/kg/min.
Do not administer other drugs in the same solution with sodium nitroprusside.
Sodium nitroprusside must be delivered by a volumetric infusion pump because small variations in infusion rate can lead to wide, undesirable variations in blood pressure [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
