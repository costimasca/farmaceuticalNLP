The oral dose and interval of administration should be adjusted for the individual patient, based on clinical assessment of the degree of underlying myocardial diseased, the patient's age, and renal function.
As a general guide, for younger adult patients with normal renal function, an initial total daily oral dose of up to 50 mg/kg of body weight of PRONESTYL (procainamide)  Capsules or Tablets may be used, given in divided doses, every three hours, to maintain therapeutic blood levels. For older patients, especially those over 50 years of age, or for patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiac insufficiency, lesser amounts or longer intervals may produce adequate blood levels, and decrease the probability of occurrence of dose-related adverse reactions. The total daily dose should be administered in divided doses at three, four, or six hour intervals and adjusted according to the patient's response.
