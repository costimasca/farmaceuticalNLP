An identical dosage regimen may be followed by administering AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)  Tablets    or AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)  Oral Solution as follows:
For the treatment of acute bleeding syndromes due to elevated fibrinolytic    activity, it is suggested that 5 AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)  1000 mg Tablets or 10 AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)  500 mg    Tablets (5 g) or 20 milliliter of AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)  Oral Solution (5 g) be administered    during the first hour of treatment, followed by a continuing rate of 1 AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)     1000 mg Tablet or 2 AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)  500 mg Tablets (1 g) or 5 milliliter of AMICAR (aminocaproic acid)  Oral    Solution (1.25 g) per hour. This method of treatment would ordinarily be continued    for about 8 hours or until the bleeding situation has been controlled.
