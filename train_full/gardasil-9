Administer GARDASIL 9 intramuscularly as a 0.5-mL dose at the following schedule: 0, 2 months, 6 months.
For intramuscular use only.
Shake well before use. Thorough agitation immediately before administration is necessary to maintain suspension of the vaccine. GARDASIL 9 should not be diluted or mixed with other vaccines. After thorough agitation, GARDASIL 9 is a white, cloudy liquid. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the product if particulates are present or if it appears discolored.
Administer GARDASIL 9 intramuscularly in the deltoid  region of the upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.
Observe patients for 15 minutes after administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Withdraw the 0.5-mL dose of vaccine from the single-dose vial using a sterile needle and syringe and use promptly.
This package does not contain a needle. Shake well before use. Attach a needle by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe. Administer the entire dose as per standard protocol.
Safety and immunogenicity of GARDASIL 9 were assessed in individuals who previously completed a three-dose vaccination series with GARDASIL [see ADVERSE REACTIONS and Clinical Studies]. Studies using a mixed regimen of HPV vaccines to assess interchangeability were not performed for GARDASIL 9.
