RETISERT (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.59 mg is implanted   into the posterior segment of the affected eye through a pars plana incision.
The implant contains one tablet of 0.59 mg of fluocinolone acetonide. RETISERT   is designed to release fluocinolone acetonide at a nominal initial rate of 0.6   μg/day, decreasing over the first month to a steady state between 0.3-0.4   μg/day over approximately 30 months. Following depletion of fluocinolone   acetonide as evidenced by recurrence of uveitis, RETISERT may be replaced.
Caution should be exercised in handling RETISERT in order to avoid damage to   the implant, which may result in an increased rate of drug release from the   implant. Thus, RETISERT should be handled only by the suture tab. Care should   be taken during implantation and explantation to avoid sheer forces on the implant   that could disengage the silicone cup reservoir (which contains a fluocinolone   acetonide tablet) from the suture tab. Aseptic technique should be maintained   at all times prior to and during the surgical implantation procedure.
RETISERT should not be resterilized by any method.
