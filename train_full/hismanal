The recommended dosage for adults and children 12 years of age and older is 10 mg (1 tablet) once daily.
Patients should be advised not to increase the dose of Astemizole in an attempt to accelerate the onset of action. (See WARNINGS.) 
Use of astemizole in patients taking ketoconazole, itraconazole, or erythromycin is contraindicated (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS.)
Studies evaluating the need for dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction have not been performed. Since astemizole is extensively metabolized by the liver, use of Astemizole in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction should generally be avoided.
Astemizole should be taken in an empty stomach, e.g., at least two hours after a meal. There should be no additional food intake for at least one hour post-dosing.
