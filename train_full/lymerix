Primary immunization against Lyme disease consists of a 30 mcg/0.5 mL dose of LYMErix (lipoprotein outer surface a vaccine)  given at 0, 1 and 12 months. 
Vaccination with all three doses is required to achieve optimal protection. 
Safety and efficacy for this vaccine are based on administration of the second and third doses several weeks prior to the onset of the Borrelia transmission season in the local geographic area (see INDICATIONS). For example, in the pivotal efficacy trial performed primarily in the Northeast United States (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Efficacy), individuals were vaccinated between January and April in both years of the trial. 
LYMErix [Lyme Disease Vaccine (Recombinant OspA)] should be administered by intramuscular injection in the deltoid region. Do not inject intravenously, intradermally or subcutaneously. 
Preparation for Administration: Shake well before withdrawal and use. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration. With thorough agitation, LYMErix (lipoprotein outer surface a vaccine)  is a turbid white suspension. Discard if it appears otherwise. Any vaccine remaining in a single-dose vial should be discarded. 
The vaccine should be used as supplied; no dilution or reconstitution is necessary. The full recommended dose of the vaccine should be used. 
As with other intramuscular injections, LYMErix (lipoprotein outer surface a vaccine)  should not be given to individuals on anticoagulant therapy or with clotting disorders, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. 
No data are available on the immune response to LYMErix (lipoprotein outer surface a vaccine)  when administered concurrently with other vaccines. When concomitant administration of other vaccines is required, they should be given with different syringes and at different injection sites (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).
