The recommended dose of Neumega in adults without severe renal impairment is 50 mcg/kg given once daily. Neumega should be administered subcutaneously as a single injection in either the abdomen, thigh, or hip (or upper arm if not self-injecting). A safe and effective dose has not been established in children (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).
The recommended dose of Neumega in adults with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  < 30 mL/min) is 25 mcg/kg. An estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min is required. CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from a spot serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the following formula:

Dosing should be initiated six to 24 hours after the completion of chemotherapy. Platelet counts should be monitored periodically to assess the optimal duration of therapy. Dosing should be continued until the post-nadir platelet count is  ≥ 50,000/μL. In controlled clinical trials, doses were administered in courses of 10 to 21 days. Dosing beyond 21 days per treatment course is not recommended.
Treatment with Neumega should be discontinued at least two days before starting the next planned cycle of chemotherapy.
