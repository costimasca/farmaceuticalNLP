The recommended starting dose for ZOMIG nasal spray is 2.5 mg. As the individual response to ZOMIG Nasal spray may vary, the dose should be adjusted on an individual basis. The maximum recommended single dose of ZOMIG is 5 mg.
In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose. There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose.
If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking ZOMIG, or returns after a transient improvement, another dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the previous dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period.
The safety of ZOMIG in the treatment of an average of more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.
ZOMIG nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients. The recommended dosage of ZOMIG nasal spray in patients with mild hepatic impairment is the same as for patients with normal hepatic function [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If ZOMIG is co-administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of ZOMIG to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
