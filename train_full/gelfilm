To prepare for use, immerse absorbable gelatin film in sterile saline solution and allow it to soak until it becomes quite pliable; it may then be cut to desired size and shape without difficulty and applied as follows:
For covering dural defects, GELFILM Sterile Film is placed over the surface of the brain, the edges of the implant tucked beneath the dura and the wound then closed in the usual manner. If desired, the GELFILM can be sutured loosely to the dura. Care must be exercised, however, because moist film tears easily. For covering pleural defects, GELFILM Sterile Film is placed over the defect and anchored in place by small interrupted sutures.
For use as a seton in iridencleisis, a small piece of GELFILM Sterile Ophthalmic Film (approximately 4 x 10 mm) is placed over the prolapsed iris pillar parallel to the limbus; Tenon's capsule and the conjunctiva are then closed with continuous absorbable sutures spaced to insure tight closure.
In diathermy or scleral “buckling” operations, GELFILM Sterile Ophthalmic Film may be placed over the sclera, the muscle and the conjunctiva then sutured over the underlying GELFILM.
In extraocular muscle surgery, GELFILM Sterile Ophthalmic Film may be placed over and beneath the muscle before Tenon's capsule and the conjunctiva are closed in layers.
