Group A infections of the upper-respiratory tract, skin and soft-tis-sue infections,    scarlet fever, and erysipelas: A single injection of Bicillin C-R 900/300 (penicillin g benzathine and penicillin g procaine injection)  is    usually sufficient for the treatment of Group A streptococcal infections in    pediatric patients.
One Bicillin C-R 900/300 (penicillin g benzathine and penicillin g procaine injection)  repeated at 2- or 3-day intervals until the temperature    is normal for 48 hours. Other forms of penicillin may be necessary for severe    cases.
Bicillin C-R is intended for Intramuscular Injection ONLY.    Do not inject into or near an artery or nerve, or intravenously or admix with    other intravenous solutions. (See WARNINGS    section). Administer by DEEP INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION in the upper, outer    quadrant of the buttock. In neonates, infants and small children, the midlateral    aspect of the thigh may be preferable. When doses are repeated, vary the injection    site.
Because of the high concentration of suspended material in this product, the    needle may be blocked if the injection is not made at a slow, steady rate.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
