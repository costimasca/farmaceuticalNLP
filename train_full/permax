Administration of Permax (pergolide mesylate)  should be initiated with a daily dosage of 0.05 mg for the first 2 days. The dosage should then be gradually increased by 0.1 or 0.15 mg/day every third day over the next 12 days of therapy. The dosage may then be increased by 0.25 mg/day every third day until an optimal therapeutic dosage is achieved. 
Permax (pergolide mesylate)  is usually administered in divided doses 3 times per day. During dosage titration, the dosage of concurrent l-dopa/carbidopa may be cautiously decreased. 
In clinical-studies, the mean therapeutic daily dosage of Permax (pergolide mesylate)  was 3 mg/day. The average concurrent daily dosage of l-dopa/carbidopa (expressed as l-dopa) was approximately 650 mg/day. The efficacy of Permax (pergolide mesylate)  at doses above 5 mg/day has not been systematically evaluated.
