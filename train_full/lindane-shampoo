Most patients will require only 1 ounce of Lindane Shampoo. Based on the length    and density of hair, some patients may require 2 ounces of Lindane Shampoo.
Apply shampoo directly to dry hair without adding water. Work thoroughly into    the hair and allow to remain in place for 4 minutes only. Special attention    should be given to the fine hairs along the neck. After 4 minutes, add small    quantities of water to hair until a good lather forms. Immediately rinse all    lather away. Avoid unnecessary contact of lather with other body surfaces. Do    not prescribe more than 2 ounces for larger adults. Do not retreat. (See BOXED    WARNINGS.)
Patients should be provided specific information on use of product. (See PRECAUTIONS:    Information for Patients and Lindane Shampoo Medication    Guide.)
A Lindane Shampoo Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time LINDANE    Shampoo is dispensed as required by law. The Lindane Shampoo Medication Guide    is an important part of the risk management program for the patient.
