RAXAR (grepafloxacin)  Tablets may be taken with or without meals. Sucralfate; antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or aluminum; multivitamins containing iron or zinc; or VIDEX (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking grepafloxacin. The usual dose for RAXAR (grepafloxacin)  is 400 mg or 600 mg orally every 24 hours as described in Table 5. 
As with other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents prolonged use of grepafloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition and microbial susceptibility testing is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Dosage adjustment is not required in patients with impaired renal function.
Patients with Hepatic Disease
