Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) before initiating HCV treatment with EPCLUSA [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended dosage of EPCLUSA is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. One tablet of EPCLUSA contains 400 mg of sofosbuvir and 100 mg of velpatasvir. Table 1 shows the recommended treatment regimen and duration based on patient population.

No dosage recommendation can be given for patients with severe renal impairment (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] less than 30 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²) or with end stage renal disease (ESRD), due to higher exposures (up to 20-fold) of the predominant sofosbuvir metabolite [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
