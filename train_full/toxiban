ToxiBan Granules - To make a thin suspension mix one volume measure with 5 to 7 parts of cold water (Ex: one level cup ToxiBan Granules to 6 cupfuls water) and shake or stir vigorously for 10-30 seconds until good suspension is obtained.
Large Animals - The recommended dosage is 0.75 to 2.0 grams per kilogram (0.35 to 0.9 grams per pound) body weight. One pound (453.6 grams) will normally treat an animal weighing 225 to 600 kilograms (500 to 1300 pounds).
Small Animals - 2 to 4 grams per kg (1 to 2 grams per pound) body weight.
Small Animals - 10 to 20 mL per kg (5 to 10 mL per pound) body weight.
Large Animals - 4 to 12 mL per kg (2 to 6 mL per pound) body weight.
ToxiBan Granules 
ToxiBan Suspension and ToxiBan Suspension with Sorbitol* 
2 grams ToxiBan Granules is equivalent to the charcoal activity of 9 mL ToxiBan Suspension.
 
Give ToxiBan Suspension or ToxiBan Suspension with Sorbitol orally by causing the animal to drink the calculated dose either as is or mixed with a small amount of cold water. To reduce viscosity and improve flow, shake the container thoroughly. The container has head room which allows for the addition of water to reduce viscosity and improve flow. Rinse the liquid receptacle with cold water and administer the rinsing. Consult a veterinarian should administration by stomach tube be needed.
DIRECTIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY:
ToxiBan Suspension or ToxiBan Suspension with Sorbitol can be poured through a funnel attached to a stomach tube in most animals. Alternate methods are use of a stomach pump or syringe to inject the suspension through a stomach tube.
Dilute suspensions of ToxiBan Granules should be stirred or agitated frequently during administration to keep the liquid uniform and prevent equipment clogging. A stomach tube or rumen tube is preferred for administration in all animals, but an oral drench may be used in an emergency.
An effective method for administering activated charcoal slurries to large animals is to use a plastic enema bag or a calf milk feeding bag. These containers allow manipulation of the slurry to keep it agitated as it is introduced into the stomach tube. Administration equipment should be flushed with a dose of cold water before removing the stomach tube. Equipment used to administer ToxiBan cleans easily with water and detergent or water alone.
Stomach tubes can be passed nasogastrically or orogastrically. First measure from tip of nose to the last rib to predetermine the length of tube needed to be inserted. The position of the tube can be checked by injecting one mL of sterile saline. Coughing will normally occur if the trachea has been intubated. For a detailed description of oral administration of liquids refer to pages 536 - 540 of the 5th edition of Handbook o f Veterinary Procedures & Emergency Treatment by Kirk et al.
Poisoned animals should be watched closely after treatment, since specific or systemic treatment may need be repeated. Repeated doses of activated charcoal given every 4 to 6 hours for 24 to 48 hours may interrupt the hepatoenteric circulation of the toxicant in cases of acute toxicosis.
