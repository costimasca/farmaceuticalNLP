DTlC-Dome (dacarbazine) 100mg/vial and 200mg/vial are reconstituted with 9.9    mL and 19.7 mL, respectively, of Sterile Water for Injection, U.S.P. The resulting    solution contains 10mg/mL of dacarbazine having a pH of 3.0 to 4.0. The calculated    dose of the resulting solution is drawn into a syringe and administered only    intravenously.
The reconstituted solution may be further diluted with 5% dextrose injection, U.S.P. or sodium chloride injection, U.S.P. and administered as an intravenous infusion.
After reconstitution and prior to use, the solution in the vial may be stored at 4°C for up to 72 hours or at normal room conditions (temperature and light) for up to 8 hours. If the reconstituted solution is further diluted in 5% dextrose injection. U.S.P. or sodium chloride injection, U.S.P., the resulting solution may be stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours or at normal room conditions for up to 8 hours.
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered.    Several guidelines on this subject have been published.7-12 There    is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines    are necessary or appropriate.
