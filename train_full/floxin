The usual dose of FLOXIN® (ofloxacin tablets) Tablets is 200 mg to 400   mg orally every 12 h as described in the following dosing chart. These recommendations   apply to patients with normal renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance  > 50   mL/min). For patients with altered renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance    < 50 mL/min), see the Patients with Impaired Renal Function Subsection.
 
Antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum; sucralfate; divalent or   trivalent cations such as iron; or multivitamins containing zinc; or Videx®   (didanosine) should not be taken within the two-hour period before or within   the two-hour period after taking ofloxacin. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
Patients with Impaired Renal Function: Dosage should be adjusted for patients   with a creatinine clearance  < 50 mL/min. After a normal initial dose, dosage   should be adjusted as follows:
 
When only the serum creatinine is known, the following formula may be used   to estimate creatinine clearance.
 
Women: 0.85 x the value calculated for men
The serum creatinine should represent a steady-state of renal function.
The excretion of ofloxacin may be reduced in patients with severe liver function   disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites). A maximum dose of 400 mg   of ofloxacin per day should therefore not be exceeded.
