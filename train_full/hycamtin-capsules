The recommended dose of HYCAMTIN capsules is 2.3 mg/m²/day orally once daily for 5 consecutive days repeated every 21 days. Round the dose to the nearest 0.25 mg, and prescribe the minimum number of 1-mg and 0.25-mg capsules. Prescribe the same number of capsules for each of the 5 dosing days.
Take HYCAMTIN capsules with or without food. Swallow capsules whole. Do not chew, crush, or divide the capsules. Do not prescribe a replacement dose for emesis.
