As directed by a physician. Dosage is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical    condition of the patient as well as laboratory determinations.
For mild acidosis, the usual dosage is 1 to 2 mEq per kg of body weight, administered    slowly.
For more severe acidosis, 2 to 5 mEq per kg of body weight may be administered    over a 4 to 8 hour period. Subsequent therapy is dependent on the clinical response    of the patient.
In emergencies, 300 to 500 mL of the 5% Sodium Bicarbonate (sodium bicarbonate 5% injection)  Injection should    or administered as rapidly as is possible without overalkalinizing the patient.  
Generally, to avoid overalkalinizing a patient whose own body mechanisms for    correcting metabolic acidosis may be maximally stimulated, only 1/3 to 1/2 of    the calculated dose is administered as rapidly as indicated by the patient's    cardiovascular and fluid balance status. The serum pH and bicarbonate concentration    should then be redetermined.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.  
Sodium Bicarbonate (sodium bicarbonate 5% injection)  Injection is intended for intravenous administration using    sterile equipment.
