Table 1*: Summary of Pharmacodynamic Properties of Insulin Products (Pooled Cross-Study Comparison) 
Humalog Mix50/50 is intended only for subcutaneous administration. Humalog Mix50/50 should not be administered intravenously. Dosage regimens of Humalog Mix50/50 will vary among patients and should be determined by the healthcare provider familiar with the patient's metabolic needs, eating habits, and other lifestyle variables. Humalog has been shown to be equipotent to Regular human insulin on a molar  basis. One unit of Humalog has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of Regular human insulin, but its effect is more rapid and of shorter duration. The quicker glucose-lowering effect of Humalog is related to the more rapid  absorption rate of insulin lispro from subcutaneous tissue.
Direct comparison between Humalog Mix50/50 and Humulin 50/50 was not performed. However, a cross-study comparison shown in Figure 3 suggests that Humalog Mix50/50 has a duration of activity that is similar to Humulin 50/50.
The rate of insulin absorption and consequently the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action of Humalog Mix50/50 may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. Patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.
Humalog Mix50/50 should be inspected visually before use. Humalog Mix50/50 should be used only if it appears uniformly cloudy after mixing. Humalog Mix50/50 should not be used after its expiration date.
