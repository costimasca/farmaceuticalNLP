Apply LIDODERM to intact skin to cover the most painful area. Apply the prescribed number of patches (maximum of 3), only once for up to 12 hours within a 24 hour period. Patches may be cut into smaller sizes with scissors prior to removal of the release liner. (See Handling And Disposal) Clothing may be worn over the area of application. Smaller areas of treatment are recommended in a debilitated patient, or a patient with impaired elimination.
If irritation or a burning sensation occurs during application, remove the patch (es) and do not reapply until the irritation subsides.
When LIDODERM is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.
LIDODERM may not stick if it gets wet. Avoid contact with water, such as bathing, swimming or showering.
Hands should be washed after the handling of LIDODERM, and eye contact with LIDODERM should be avoided. Do not store patch outside the sealed envelope. Apply immediately after removal from the protective envelope. Fold used patches so that the adhesive side sticks to itself and safely discard used patches or pieces of cut patches where children and pets cannot get to them. LIDODERM should be kept out of the reach of children.
