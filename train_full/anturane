Initial  
200-400 mg daily in two divided doses, with meals or milk, gradually increasing when necessary to full maintenance dosage in one week. 
Maintenance 
400mg daily, given in two divided doses, as above. This dosage may be increased to 800 mg daily, if necessary, and may sometimes be reduced to as low as 200 mg daily after the blood urate level has been controlled. Treatment should be continued without interruption even in the presence of acute exacerbations, which can be concomitantly treated with phenylbutazone or colchicine. Patients previously controlled with other uricosuric therapy may be transferred to Anturane (sulfinpyrazone)  at full maintenance dosage.
