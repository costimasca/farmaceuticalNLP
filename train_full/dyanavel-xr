Prior to treating children, adolescents, and adults with CNS stimulants, including DYANAVEL XR, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically re-evaluate the need for DYANAVEL XR use [see PRECAUTIONS, and Drug Abuse and Dependence].
DYANAVEL XR should be orally administered once daily in the morning with or without food. The dose should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient. Before administering the dose, shake the bottle of DYANAVEL XR.
In children 6 years of age and older, start with 2.5 mg or 5 mg once daily in the morning. The dose may be increased in increments of 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day every 4 to 7 days up to a maximum dose of 20 mg per day.
Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Healthcare providers should periodically re-evaluate the long-term use of DYANAVEL XR, and adjust dosage as needed.
If switching from other amphetamine products, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with DYANAVEL XR using the above titration schedule.
Do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis, because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see DESCRIPTION, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Agents that alter urinary pH can impact urinary excretion and alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents (e.g., ascorbic acid) decrease blood levels, while alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) increase blood levels. Adjust DYANAVEL XR dosage accordingly [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
