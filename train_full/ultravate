Apply a thin layer of ULTRAVATE lotion to the affected skin twice daily for up to two weeks. Rub in gently.
Discontinue therapy when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within two weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
Treatment beyond two weeks is not recommended and the total dosage should not exceed 50 grams (50 mL) per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Do not use with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.
ULTRAVATE lotion is for external use only.
Avoid use on the face, scalp, groin, or axillae.
ULTRAVATE lotion is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use.
