GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  consists of 9%–11% protein in 0.16–0.24 M glycine. The buffering capacity of GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  is 35.0 mEq/L (0.35 mEq/g protein). A dose of 1 g/kg body weight therefore represents an acid load of 0.35 mEq/kg body weight. The total buffering capacity of whole blood in a normal individual is 45–50 mEq/L of blood, or 3.6 mEq/kg body weight [15]. Thus, the acid load delivered with a dose of 1 g/kg of GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  would be neutralized by the buffering capacity of whole blood alone, even if the dose was infused instantaneously.
As there are significant differences in the half-life of IgG among patients   with primary immunodeficiencies, the frequency and amount of immunoglobulin   therapy may vary from patient to patient. The proper amount can be determined   by monitoring clinical response.
The dose of GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  for replacement therapy in primary immune deficiency diseases   is 300 to 600 mg/kg body weight (3-6 mL/kg) administered every 3 to 4 weeks.   The dosage may be adjusted over time to achieve the desired trough levels and   clinical responses.
GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  may be administered at a total dose of 2 g/kg, divided in two doses of 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) given on two consecutive days or into five doses of 0.4 g/kg (4 mL/kg) given on five consecutive days. If after administration of the first of two daily 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) doses, an adequate increase in the platelet count is observed at 24 hours, the second dose of 1g/kg (10 mL/kg) body weight may be withheld.
Forty-eight ITP subjects were treated with 2 g/kg GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) , divided in two 1   g/kg doses (10 mL/kg) given on two successive days. With this dose regimen 35/39   subjects (90%) responded with a platelet count from less than or equal to 20   x109/L to more than or equal to 50 x109/L within 7 days   after treatment. [11] The high dose regimen (1 g/kg × 1-2 days) is not recommended   for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be a concern.
GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  may be initially administered as a total loading dose of 2 g/kg (20 mL/kg) given in divided doses over two to four consecutive days. GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  may be administered as a maintenance infusion of 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) administered over 1 day  or divided into two doses of 0.5 g/kg (5 mL/kg) given on two consecutive days, every 3 weeks.
GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  Do not use if turbid and/or if discoloration is observed.
Only administer intravenously. GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  should be at room temperature during administration.
Only 18 gauge needles should be used to penetrate the stopper for dispensing   product from the 10 mL vial; 16 gauge needles or dispensing pins should only   be used with 25 mL vial sizes and larger. Needles or dispensing pins should   only be inserted once and be within the stopper area delineated by the raised   ring. The stopper should be penetrated perpendicular to the plane of the stopper   within the ring.

Any vial that has been opened should be used promptly. Partially used vials should be discarded.
If dilution is required, GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  may be diluted with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W).
It is recommended that GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  should initially be infused at a rate of 0.01   mL/kg per minute (1 mg/kg per minute) for the first 30 minutes. If well-tolerated,   the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 0.08 mL/kg per minute (8   mg/kg per minute).

Certain severe adverse drug reactions may be related to the rate of infusion.   Slowing or stopping the infusion usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly.
Ensure that patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency are not volume depleted;   discontinue GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  if renal function deteriorates.
For patients at risk of renal dysfunction or thromboembolic events, administer   GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  at the minimum infusion rate practicable.
GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  is not compatible with saline.  If dilution is required, GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  may be diluted with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W). No other drug interactions or compatibilities have been evaluated.
GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%)  may be stored for  36  months at 2-8ºC (36-46ºF) from the date of manufacture AND product may be stored at temperatures not to exceed 25ºC (77º F) for up to 6 months any time during the 36 month shelf life , after which the product must be immediately discarded.
Do not freeze. Frozen product should not be used. Do not use after expiration date
