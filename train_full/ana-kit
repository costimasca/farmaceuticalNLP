Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit.
Vial and contents must be discarded 30 days after initial use.
Subcutaneously or intramuscularly - 0.2 to 1 mL (mg). Start with a small dose    and increase if required.
Note: The subcutaneous is the preferred route of administration. If    given intramuscularly, injection into the buttocks should be avoided.
For bronchial asthma and certain allergic manifestations, e.g., angioedema, urticaria, serum sickness, anaphylactic shock, use epinephrine subcutaneously. For bronchial asthma in pediatric patients, administer 0.01 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/m2 to a maximum of 0.5 mg subcutaneously, repeated every four hours if required.
For cardiac resuscitation - A dose of 0.5 mL (0.5 mg) diluted to 10    mL with sodium chloride injection can be administered intravenously or intracardially    to restore myocardial contrac-tility. External cardiac massage should follow    intracardial administration to permit the drug to enter coronary circulation.    The drug should be used secondarily to unsuccessful attempts with physical or    electromechanical methods.
Ophthalmologic use (for producing conjunctival decongestion, to control    hemorrhage, produce mydriasis and reduce intraocular pressure)—Use a concentration    of 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL) to 1:1,000 (1 mg/mL).
Intraspinal use (Amp 88) - Usual dose is 0.2 to 0.4 mL (0.2 to 0.4 mg)    added to anesthetic spinal fluid mixture (may prolong anesthetic action by limiting    absorption). For use with local anesthetic—Epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg/mL)    to 1:20,000 (0.05 mg/mL) is the usual concentration employed with local anesthetics.
