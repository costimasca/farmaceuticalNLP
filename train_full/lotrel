The recommended initial dose of Lotrel is 1 capsule of amlodipine 2.5 mg/benazepril 10 mg orally once-daily.
It is usually appropriate to begin therapy with Lotrel only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired  antihypertensive effect with amlodipine or benazepril monotherapy, or (b) demonstrated inability to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine therapy without developing edema.
The antihypertensive effect of Lotrel is largely attained within 2 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, the dose may be titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg/benazepril 40 mg once-daily. The dosing should be individualized and adjusted according to the patient's clinical response.
Amlodipine is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 10 mg while benazepril is effective in doses of 10 to 80 mg. In clinical trials of amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5 to 10 mg and benazepril doses of 10 to 40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups.
Lotrel is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than or equal to 30 mL/min. No dose adjustment of Lotrel is required in patients with CrCl greater than 30 mL/min/1.73mÂ² (serum creatinine roughly less than or equal to 3 mg/dL or 265 micromol/L) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Lotrel may be substituted for the titrated components.
