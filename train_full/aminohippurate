For intravenous use only
Clearance measurements using single injection techniques are generally inaccurate,    particularly in the measurement of ERPF. For this reason, intravenous infusions    at fixed rates are used to sustain the plasma PAH concentration at the desired    level.
To measure ERPF, the concentration of PAH in the plasma should be maintained    at 2 mg per 100 mL, which can be achieved with a priming dose of 6 to 10 mg/kg    and an infusion dose of 10 to 24 mg/min.
As a research procedure for the measurement of TmPAH, the plasma    level of PAH must be sufficient to saturate the capacity of the tubular secretory    cells. Concentrations from 40 to 60 mg per 100 mL are usually necessary.
Technical details of these tests may be found in Smith1; Wesson2;    Bauer3; Pitts4; and Schnurr5.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter    and discoloration prior to use, whenever solution and container permit.

The clearance of PAH, which is extracted almost completely from the plasma during its passage through the renal circulation, constitutes a measure of ERPF. Hence:
ERPF = UPAHV/ PPAH
Where UPAH = concentration of PAH (mg/mL) in the urine   V = rate of urine excretion (mL/min), and   PPAH = plasma concentration of PAH (mg/mL).
Example: UPAH = 8.0 mg/mL
V = 1.5 mL/min
PPAH = 0.02 mg/mL
ERPF = 8.0 x 1.5/0.02 = 600 mL/min 
Based on PAH clearance studies, the normal values for ERPF are:
men 675 ± 150 mL/min   women 595 ± 125 mL/min
(TmPAH) Mechanism
The quantity of PAH secreted by the tubules (TmPAH) is given by    the difference between the total rate of excretion (UPAHV) and the    quantity filtered by the glomeruli (GFR x PPAH). Hence:
 TmPAH= UPAHV – (GFR x PPAH x 0.83)
The factor, 0.83, corrects for that portion of PAH which is bound to plasma protein and hence is unfilterable. Example:
UPAH = 9.55 mg/mL   V = 16.68 mL/min   GFR = 120 mL/min   PPAH = 0.60 mg/mL    Then TmPAH = 9.55 x 16.68 – (120 x 0.60 x 0.83) = 100 mg/min. Average    normal values of TmPAH are 80-90 mg/min. 
The value of the expression UPAHV, used in calculations of ERPF    and TmPAH, may be found by determining the amount of PAH in a measured    volume of urine excreted within a specific period of time.
These calculations are based on a body surface area of 1.73 m2.    Corrections for variations in surface area are made by multiplying the values    obtained for ERPF and TmPAH by 1.73/A, where A is the subject surface area.
