Apply a thin layer of TEMOVATE速 Cream or Ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).
TEMOVATE速 Cream and Ointment are super-high potency topical corti-costeroids; therefore, treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and amounts greater than 50 g/week should not be used.
As with other highly active corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
TEMOVATE速 Cream and Ointment should not be used with occlusive dressings.
In studies where geriatric patients (65 years of age or older, see PRECAUTIONS) have been treated with TEMOVATE速 Cream or Ointment, safety did not differ from that in younger patients; therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended.
