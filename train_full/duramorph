DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  is intended for intravenous, epidural or intrathecal administration.
Not For Use in Continuous Microinfusion Devices
The initial dose of morphine should be 2 mg to 10 mg/70 kg of body weight. No information is available regarding the use of DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  in patients under the age of 18.
Administer with extreme caution. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED EPIDURALLY BY OR UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A   PHYSICIAN EXPERIENCED IN THE TECHNIQUE OF EPIDURAL ADMINISTRATION AND WHO IS   THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE LABELING. IT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY IN SETTINGS   WHERE ADEQUATE PATIENT MONITORING IS POSSIBLE. RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT AND A   SPECIFIC ANTAGONIST (NALOXONE INJECTION) SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR   THE MANAGEMENT OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AS WELL AS COMPLICATIONS WHICH MIGHT   RESULT FROM INADVERTENT INTRATHECAL OR INTRAVASCULAR INJECTION. (NOTE: INTRATHECAL   DOSAGE IS USUALLY 1/10 THAT OF EPIDURAL DOSAGE.) PATIENT MONITORING SHOULD   BE CONTINUED FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS AFTER EACH DOSE, SINCE DELAYED RESPIRATORY   DEPRESSION MAY OCCUR.
Proper placement of a needle or catheter in the epidural space should be verified before DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  is injected.
Acceptable techniques for verifying proper placement include: a) aspiration   to check for absence of blood or cerebrospinal fluid, or b) administration of   5 mL (3 mL in obstetric patients) of 1.5% PRESERVATIVE-FREE Lidocaine and Epinephrine   (1:200,000) Injection and then observe the patient for lack of tachycardia (this   indicates that vascular injection has not been made) and lack of sudden   onset of segmental anesthesia (this indicates that intrathecal injection has   not been made).
Initial injection of 5 mg in the lumbar region may provide satisfactory pain relief for up to 24 hours. If adequate pain relief is not achieved within one hour, careful administration of incremental doses of 1 to 2 mg at intervals sufficient to assess effectiveness may be given. No more than 10 mg/24 hr should be administered.
Thoracic administration has been shown to dramatically increase the incidence of early and late respiratory depression even at doses of 1 to 2 mg.
Administer with extreme caution. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
No information on use in pediatric patients is available. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
NOTE: INTRATHECAL DOSAGE IS USUALLY 1/10 THAT OF EPIDURAL DOSAGE.
DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED INTRATHECALLY BY OR UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A PHYSICIAN EXPERIENCED IN THE TECHNIQUE OF INTRATHECAL ADMINISTRATION AND WHO IS THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE LABELING. IT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY IN SETTINGS WHERE ADEQUATE PATIENT MONITORING IS POSSIBLE. RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT AND A SPECIFIC
ANTAGONIST (NALOXONE INJECTION) SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR THE MANAGEMENT   OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AS WELL AS COMPLICATIONS WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM INADVERTENT   INTRAVASCULAR INJECTION. PATIENT MONITORING SHOULD BE CONTINUED FOR AT LEAST   24 HOURS AFTER EACH DOSE, SINCE DELAYED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION MAY OCCUR.   RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION (BOTH EARLY AND LATE ONSET) HAS OCCURRED MORE FREQUENTLY   FOLLOWING INTRATHECAL ADMINISTRATION THAN EPIDURAL ADMINISTRATION.
A single injection of 0.2 to 1 mg may provide satisfactory pain relief for up to 24 hours. (CAUTION: THIS IS ONLY 0.4 TO 2 ML OF THE 5 MG/10 ML AMPUL OR 0.2 TO 1 ML OF THE 10 MG/10 ML AMPUL OF DURAMORPH (morphine injection) ). DO NOT INJECT INTRATHECALLY MORE THAN 2 ML OF THE 5 MG/10 ML AMPUL OR 1 ML OF THE 10 MG/10 ML AMPUL. USE IN THE LUMBAR AREA ONLY IS RECOMMENDED. Repeated intrathecal injections of DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  are not recommended. A constant intravenous infusion of naloxone, 0.6 mg/hr, for 24 hours after intrathecal injection may be used to reduce the incidence of potential side effects.
Administer with extreme caution. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
If pain recurs, alternative routes of administration should be considered, since experience with repeated doses of morphine by the intrathecal route is limited.
No information on use in pediatric patients is available. (See PRECAUTIONS.)
DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  is supplied in sealed ampuls. Accidental dermal exposure should be treated by the removal of any contaminated clothing and rinsing the affected area with water.
Each ampul of DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  contains a potent narcotic which has been associated   with abuse and dependence among health care providers. Due to the limited   indications for this product, the risk of overdosage and the risk of its diversion   and abuse, it is recommended that special measures be taken to control this   product within the hospital or clinic.
DURAMORPH (morphine injection)  should be subject to rigid accounting, rigorous control of   wastage and restricted access.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected for participate matter and   discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.   DO NOT USE IF COLOR IS DARKER THAN PALE YELLOW, IF IT IS DISCOLORED IN ANY OTHER   WAY OR IF IT CONTAINS A PRECIPITATE.
