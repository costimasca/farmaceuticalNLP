Conduct liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with ESBRIET [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
The recommended daily maintenance dosage of ESBRIET is 801 mg three times daily for a total of 2403 mg/day. Doses should be taken with food at the same time each day.
Upon initiation of treatment, titrate to the full dosage of 2403 mg/day over a 14-day period as follows:
Table 1: Dosage Titration for ESBRIET in Patients with IPF 
Dosages above 2403 mg/day are not recommended for any patient. Patients should not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. Patients should not take more than 3 doses per day.
Patients who miss 14 or more days of ESBRIET should re-initiate treatment by undergoing the initial 2-week titration regimen up to the full maintenance dosage [see Recommended Dosage]. For treatment interruption of less than 14 days, the dosage prior to the interruption can be resumed.
If patients experience significant adverse reactions (i.e., gastrointestinal, photosensitivity reaction or rash), consider temporary dosage reductions or interruptions of ESBRIET to allow for resolution of symptoms [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Dosage   modifications or interruptions may also be necessary when liver enzyme and   bilirubin elevations are exhibited. For liver enzyme elevations, modify the   dosage as follows:
If a patient exhibits  > 3 but  ≥ 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT and/or AST without symptoms or hyperbilirubinemia after starting ESBRIET therapy:
If a patient exhibits  > 3 but  ≥ 5 x ULN ALT and/or AST accompanied by symptoms or hyperbilirubinemia:
If a patient exhibits  > 5 x ULN ALT and/or AST:
Reduce ESBRIET to 267 mg three times a day (801 mg/day).
With use of ciprofloxacin at a dosage of 750 mg twice daily, reduce ESBRIET to 534 mg three times a day (1602 mg/day).
