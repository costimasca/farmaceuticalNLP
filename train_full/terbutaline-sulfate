The usual subcutaneous dose of terbutaline sulfate injection is 0.25 mg injected into the lateral deltoid area. If significant clinical improvement does not occur within 15 to 30 minutes, a second dose of 0.25 mg may be administered. If the patient then fails to respond within another 15 to 30 minutes, other therapeutic measures should be considered. The total dose within 4 hours should not exceed 0.5 mg.
Note: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate   matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container   permit.
