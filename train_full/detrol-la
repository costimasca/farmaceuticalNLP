The recommended dose of DETROL LA Capsules is 4 mg once daily with water and swallowed   whole. The dose may be lowered to 2 mg daily based on individual response and tolerability; however,   limited efficacy data are available for DETROL LA 2 mg [see Clinical Studies].
For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) or severe renal   impairment (CCr 10â€“30 mL/min), the recommended dose of DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily. DETROL   LA is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).   Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of DETROL LA in this population is not   recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use In Specific Populations].
For patients who are taking drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 [e.g., ketoconazole,   clarithromycin, ritonavir], the recommended dose of DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
