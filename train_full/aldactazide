Optimal dosage should be established by individual titration of the components (see BOXED WARNING).
 The usual maintenance dose of   ALDACTAZIDE is 100 mg each of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide daily,   administered in a single dose or in divided doses, but may range from 25 mg to   200 mg of each component daily depending on the response to the initial   titration. In some instances it may be desirable to administer separate tablets   of either ALDACTONE (spironolactone) or hydrochlorothiazide in addition to   ALDACTAZIDE in order to provide optimal individual therapy.
The onset of diuresis with ALDACTAZIDE occurs promptly and, due to prolonged effect of the spironolactone component, persists for two to three days after ALDACTAZIDE is discontinued.
Although the dosage will   vary depending on the results of titration of the individual ingredients, many   patients will be found to have an optimal response to 50 mg to 100 mg each of   spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide daily, given in a single dose or in   divided doses.
Concurrent potassium supplementation is not recommended when ALDACTAZIDE is used in the long-term management of hypertension or in the treatment of most edematous conditions, since the spironolactone content of ALDACTAZIDE is usually sufficient to minimize loss induced by the hydrochlorothiazide component.
