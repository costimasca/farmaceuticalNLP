For intracheal administration only.
CUROSURF should be administered by, or under the supervision of clinicians experienced in intubation, ventilator management, and general care of premature infants. Before administering CUROSURF, assure proper placement and patency of the endotracheal tube. At the discretion of the clinician, the endotracheal tube may be suctioned before administering CUROSURF. Allow the infant to stabilize before proceeding with dosing.
Administer CUROSURF either:
The initial recommended dose is 2.5 mL/kg birth weight (see Table 1), administered as one or two aliquots depending upon the instillation procedure [see Preparation of the CUROSURF Suspension].
Up to two repeat doses of 1.25 mL/kg birth weight each may be administered at approximately 12-hour intervals in infants who remain intubated and in whom RDS is considered responsible for their persisting or deteriorating respiratory status. The maximum recommended total dosage (sum of the initial and up to two repeat doses) is 5 mL/kg.
