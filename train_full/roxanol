CAUTION: Roxanolâ„¢ (Morphine Sulfate 20 mg/mL) is a HIGHLY CONCENTRATED    solution of Morphine Sulfate for Oral Administration.Error in dosage or confusion    between milligrams (mg) of morphine and milliliters (mL) of solution may cause    significant over-dosage. Dosing instructions should be clearly pre-scribed in    milligrams (mg) of morphine and milliliters (mL) of solution. VERIFY CORRECT    DOSE AND VOLUME BEFORE ADMINISTRATION TO PATIENT.
10 to 30 mg every 4 hours or as directed by physician. Dosage is a patient    dependent variable, therefore increased dosage may be required to achieve adequate    analgesia.
For control of severe, chronic pain in patients with certain terminal diseases,    this drug should be administered on a regularly scheduled basis, every 4 hours,    at the lowest dosage level that will achieve adequate analgesia.
Note: Medication may suppress respiration in the elderly, the very ill,    and those patients with respiratory problems, therefore lower doses may be required.
During the first two to three days of effective pain relief, the patient may    sleep for many hours. This can be misinterpreted as the effect of excessive    analgesic dosing rather than the first sign of relief in a pain exhausted patient.    The dose, therefore, should be maintained for at least three days before reduction,    if respiratory activity and other vitals signs are adequate.
Following successful relief of severe pain, periodic attempts to reduce the    narcotic dose should be made. Smaller doses or complete discontinuation of the    narcotic analgesic may become feasible due to a physiologic change or the improved    mental state of the patient.
