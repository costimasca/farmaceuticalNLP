NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))  is an insulin analog with an earlier onset and intermediate   duration of action in comparison to the basal human insulin premix. The addition   of protamine to the rapid-acting aspart insulin analog (NovoLog) results in   insulin activity that is 30% short-acting and 70% long-acting. NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))    is typically dosed on a twice-daily basis (with each dose intended to cover   2 meals or a meal and a snack). The dosage of NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))  must be individualized.   The written prescription for NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))  should include the full name,   to avoid confusion with NovoLog (insulin aspart) and Novolin 70/30 (human premix).
NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))  should appear uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if   it looks clear or if it contains solid particles.

For patients with   type 2 diabetes, dosing should occur within 15 minutes before or after meal   initiation. Injection sites should be rotated within the same region to reduce   the risk of lipodystrophy.

The NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))  FlexPen should be rolled 10 times gently between your   hands in a horizontal position. Thereafter, turn the NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))  FlexPen   upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the   other. Do this at least 10 times. The rolling and turning procedure must be   repeated until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy. Inject immediately.   Before each subsequent injection, turn the disposable NovoLog Mix 70/30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin))  FlexPen   upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the   other at least 10 times and until the suspension appears uniformly white and   cloudy.
