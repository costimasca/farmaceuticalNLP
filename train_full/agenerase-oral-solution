AGENERASE may be taken with or without food; however, a high- fat meal decreases    the absorption of amprenavir and should be avoided (see CLINICAL    PHARMACOLOGY: Effects of Food on Oral Absorption). Adult and pediatric    patients should be advised not to take supplemental vitamin E since the vitamin    E content of AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  exceeds the Reference Daily Intake (adults    30 IU, pediatrics approximately 10 IU) (see DESCRIPTION).
The recommended dose of AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  based on body weight and age    is shown in Table 12. Consideration should be given to switching patients    from AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  to AGENERASE Capsules as soon as they are able    to take the capsule formulation (see WARNINGS).    
Table 12. Recommended Dosages of AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)    
 
 Concomitant Therapy: Concurrent use of AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)    and NORVIR (ritonavir) Oral Solution is not recommended because the large amount   of propylene glycol in AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  and ethanol in NORVIR Oral Solution   may compete for the same metabolic pathway for elimination.
Patients with Hepatic Impairment: AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  is contraindicated   in patients with hepatic failure (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Patients with hepatic impairment are at increased risk of propylene glycol-associated   adverse events (see WARNINGS). AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  should be used   with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on a study with AGENERASE   Capsules, adult patients with a Child-Pugh score ranging from 5 to 8 should   receive a reduced dose of AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  of 513 mg (34 mL) twice daily,   and adult patients with a Child-Pugh score ranging from 9 to 12 should receive   a reduced dose of AGENERASE Oral Solution of 342 mg (23 mL) twice daily (see   CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Hepatic Insufficiency).
AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  has not been studied in children with hepatic impairment. 
Renal Insufficiency: AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  is contraindicated in patients   with renal failure (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Patients with renal impairment are at increased risk of propylene glycol-associated   adverse events. AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  should be used with caution in patients   with renal impairment (see WARNINGS).
AGENERASE Capsules and AGENERASE Oral Solution (amprenavir oral solution)  are not interchangeable on    a milligram-per-milligram basis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
