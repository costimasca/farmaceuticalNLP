The recommended initial once-daily dose of Tekamlo is 150 mg/5 mg. Titrate as needed to a maximum of 300 mg/10 mg.
The blood pressure lowering effects are largely attained within 1 to 2 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, titrate the dose to a maximum of Tekamlo 300 mg/10 mg once daily.
Use Tekamlo for patients not adequately controlled with aliskiren alone or amlodipine besylate (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone.
Switch a patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone to Tekamlo containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.
Switch patients receiving aliskiren and amlodipine besylate from separate tablets to a single tablet of Tekamlo containing the same component doses. When substituting for individual components, increase the dose of one or both of the components if blood pressure control has not been satisfactory.
Patients should establish a routine pattern for taking Tekamlo, either with or without a meal. High-fat meals decrease absorption substantially [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
