ARESTIN速 is provided as a dry powder, packaged in a unit-dose cartridge with a deformable tip (see Figure 1), which is inserted into a spring-loaded cartridge handle mechanism (see Figure 2) to administer the product.
The oral health care professional removes the disposable cartridge from its pouch and connects the cartridge to the handle mechanism (see Figures 3-4). ARESTIN速 is a variable dose product, dependent on the size, shape, and number of pockets being treated. In US clinical trials, up to 122 unit-dose cartridges were used in a single visit and up to 3 treatments, at 3-month intervals, were administered in pockets with pocket depth of 5 mm or greater.

The administration of ARESTIN速 does not require local  anesthesia. Professional subgingival administration is accomplished by inserting the unit-dose cartridge to the base of the periodontal pocket and then pressing the thumb ring in the handle mechanism to expel the powder while gradually withdrawing the tip from the base of the pocket. The handle mechanism should be sterilized between patients. ARESTIN速 does not have to be removed, as it is bioresorbable, nor is an adhesive or dressing required.
