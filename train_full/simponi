The SIMPONI dose regimen is 50 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once a month.
For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SIMPONI should be given in combination with methotrexate and for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS), SIMPONI may be given with or without methotrexate or other nonbiologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). For patients with RA, PsA, or AS, corticosteroids, non-biologic DMARDs, and/or NSAIDs may be continued during treatment with SIMPONI.
The recommended SIMPONI induction dosage regimen is a 200-mg subcutaneous injection at Week 0, followed by 100 mg at Week 2, and then maintenance therapy with 100 mg every 4 weeks.
Prior to initiating SIMPONI and periodically during therapy, evaluate patients for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infection [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Prior to initiating SIMPONI, patients should be tested for hepatitis B viral infection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
SIMPONI is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare provider. After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, a patient may self-inject with SIMPONI if a physician determines that it is appropriate.
