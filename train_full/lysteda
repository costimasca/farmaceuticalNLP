The recommended dose of LYSTEDA for women with normal renal function is two 650 mg tablets taken three times daily (3900 mg/day) for a maximum of 5 days during monthly menstruation. LYSTEDA may be administered without regard to meals. Tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed or broken apart.
In patients with renal impairment, the plasma concentration of tranexamic acid increased as serum creatinine concentration increased [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Dosage adjustment is needed in patients with serum creatinine concentration higher than 1.4 mg/dL (Table 1).
