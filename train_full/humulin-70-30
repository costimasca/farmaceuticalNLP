Inspect HUMULIN 70/30 visually before use. It should not contain particulate matter and should appear uniformly cloudy after mixing. Do not use HUMULIN 70/30 if particulate matter is seen. Do not mix HUMULIN 70/30 with any other insulins or diluents.
HUMULIN 70/30 should only be administered subcutaneously. Administer in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall, thigh, upper arm, or buttocks. To reduce the risk of lipodystrophy, rotate the injection site within the same region from one injection to the next [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
Do not administer HUMULIN 70/30 intravenously or intramuscularly and do not use HUMULIN 70/30 in an insulin infusion pump.
Individualize and adjust the dosage of HUMULIN 70/30 based on the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and Use in Specific Populations].
The proportion of rapid acting and long acting insulin is fixed in a premixed insulin such as HUMULIN 70/30. Independent adjustment of the basal or prandial dose is not possible when using a premixed insulin.
Physiological factors, disease states and concomitant drugs may impact the onset and duration of action of all insulins. HUMULIN 70/30 dose requirements may change with changes in level of physical activity, meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during major illness, or with some coadministered drugs [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and Use In Specific Populations].
HUMULIN 70/30 should be given subcutaneously approximately 30-45 minutes before a meal.
