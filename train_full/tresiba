The recommended starting dose of TRESIBA in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be administered as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes.
The recommended starting dose of TRESIBA in insulin naïve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is 10 units once daily.
Start TRESIBA at the same unit dose as the total daily long or intermediate-acting insulin unit dose.
Start TRESIBA at 80% of the total daily long or intermediate-acting insulin unit dose to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
