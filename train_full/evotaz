Prior to starting EVOTAZ, assess estimated creatinine clearance because cobicistat decreases estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. When coadministering EVOTAZ with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), assess estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein at baseline and routinely monitor during treatment [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
In patients with underlying hepatitis B or C viral infections, conduct hepatic laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and during treatment with EVOTAZ [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
EVOTAZ is a fixed-dose combination product containing 300 mg of atazanavir and 150 mg of cobicistat. In treatment-naive and -experienced adults, the recommended dosage of EVOTAZ is one tablet taken once daily orally with food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Administer EVOTAZ in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
When coadministered with H2-receptor antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors, dose separation may be required [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
EVOTAZ is not recommended in HIV-1 treatment-experienced patients with end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
EVOTAZ coadministered with tenofovir DF is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min. Coadministration of EVOTAZ and tenofovir DF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent is not recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and  ADVERSE REACTIONS].
EVOTAZ is not recommended in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use in Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
