Xgeva should be administered by a healthcare professional.
The recommended dose of Xgeva is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months. Administer Xgeva via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, the upper thigh, or the abdomen. All patients should receive calcium 1000 mg daily and at least 400 IU vitamin D daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
If a dose of Xgeva is missed, administer the injection as soon as the patient is available. Thereafter, schedule injections every 6 months from the date of the last injection.
Visually inspect Xgeva for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Xgeva is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution that may contain trace amounts of translucent to white proteinaceous particles. Do not use if the solution is discolored or cloudy or if the solution contains many particles or foreign particulate matter.
People sensitive to latex should not handle the grey needle cap on the single-use prefilled syringe, which contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex).
Prior to administration, Xgeva may be removed from the refrigerator and brought to room temperature (up to 25°C/77°F) by standing in the original container. This generally takes 15 to 30 minutes. Do not warm Xgeva in any other way [see HOW SUPPLIED/Storage and Handling].
IMPORTANT: In order to minimize accidental needlesticks, the Xgeva single-use prefilled syringe will have a green safety guard; manually activate the safety guard after the injection is given.
DO NOT slide the green safety guard forward over the needle before administering the injection; it will lock in place and prevent injection.
 
Activate the green safety guard (slide over the needle) after the injection.
The grey needle cap on the single-use prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex); people sensitive to latex should not handle the cap.
Step 1: Remove Grey Needle Cap
 
Step 2: Administer Subcutaneous Injection
Choose an injection site. The recommended injection sites for Xgeva include: the upper arm OR the upper thigh OR the abdomen.
 
Insert needle and inject all the liquid subcutaneously.
Do not administer into muscle or blood vessel.
 
DO NOT put grey needle cap back on needle.
Step 3: Immediately Slide Green Safety Guard Over Needle
With the needle pointing away from youâ€¦
Hold the prefilled syringe by the clear plastic finger grip with one hand. Then, with the other hand, grasp the green safety guard by its base and gently slide it towards the needle until the green safety guard locks securely in place and/or you hear a “click.” DO NOT grip the green safety guard too firmly â€“ it will move easily if you hold and slide it gently.
Hold clear finger grip.
 
Gently slide green safety guard over needle and lock securely in place. Do not grip green safety guard too firmly when sliding over needle.
 
Immediately dispose of the syringe and needle cap in the nearest sharps container. DO NOT put the needle cap back on the used syringe.
For administration of Xgeva from the single-use vial, use a 27-gauge needle to withdraw and inject the 1 mL dose. Do not re-enter the vial. Discard vial and any liquid remaining in the vial.
