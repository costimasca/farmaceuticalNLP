Topically apply XERESE (acyclovir and hydrocortisone cream)  5 times per day for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible after the first signs and symptoms (i.e., during the prodrome or when lesions appear).
For each dose, topically apply a quantity of XERESE (acyclovir and hydrocortisone cream)  sufficient to cover the affected area, including the outer margin. Avoid unnecessary rubbing of the affected area to avoid aggravating or transferring the infection. For adolescents 12 years of age and older, the dosage is the same as in adults.
