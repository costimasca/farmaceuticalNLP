Initially, take one BONJESTA extended-release tablet orally at bedtime (Day 1). If this dose adequately controls symptoms the next day, continue taking one tablet daily at bedtime only. However, if symptoms persist on Day 2, increase the daily dose to one tablet in the morning and one tablet at bedtime. The maximum recommended dose is two tablets per day, one in the morning and one at bedtime.
Take on an empty stomach with a glass of water [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush, chew, or split BONJESTA tablets.
Take daily and not on an as needed basis. Reassess the woman for continued need for BONJESTA as her pregnancy progresses.
