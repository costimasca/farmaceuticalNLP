The medicinal product is for single intravenous use only as repeated dosing   has not been studied. It should be administered as an intravenous infusion at   the rate of 2-3 ml/min for liver imaging and at a rate of 4-6 ml/min for imaging   of the pancreas.
Near maximal enhancement of the normal liver and pancreas parenchyma is generally   observed 15-20 minutes from the start of administration and lasts for approximately 4 hours.
At the clinical dose the contrast agent has no T2-effect, and pre-   and post- T2-weighted images are equivalent. The clinical use of   TESLASCAN (mangafodipir)  has been investigated at field strengths from 0.5 to 2.0 Tesla.
The recommended dose is 0.5 ml/kg bodyweight (5 Î¼mol/kg bodyweight). This   corresponds to a dose of 35 ml for a 70 kg person. Above 100 kg body weight,   50 ml is usually sufficient to provide a diagnostically adequate contrast effect. 
Dosage for elderly 4
Pharmacokinetics in the elderly has not been investigated. However, clinical   studies to date do not suggest that a dose adjustment is required.
Safety and efficacy in patients below the age of 18 have not been documented   i.e. children (2-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years).
