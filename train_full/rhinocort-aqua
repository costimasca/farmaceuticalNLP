The recommended starting dosage for adults and children 6 years of age and older is 64 mcg per day administered as one spray per nostril of RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide)  Nasal Spray 32 mcg once daily. Some patients who do not achieve symptom control at the recommended starting dosage may benefit from an increased dosage. The maximum recommended dosage for adults (12 years of age and older) is 256 mcg per day administered as four sprays per nostril once daily of RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide)  Nasal Spray 32 mcg and the maximum recommended dose for pediatric patients (6 to  < 12 years of age) is 128 mcg per day administered as two sprays per nostril once daily of RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide)  Nasal Spray 32 mcg.
It is always desirable to titrate an individual patient to the minimum effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. An improvement in nasal symptoms may be noted in patients within 10 hours of first using RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide)  Nasal Spray, however, clinical improvement usually takes 1 -2 days with maximum benefit in approximately 2 weeks. When the maximum benefit has been achieved and symptoms have been controlled, reducing the dosage may be effective in maintaining control of the allergic rhinitis symptoms in patients who were initially controlled on higher dosages.
Prior to initial use, the container must be shaken gently and the pump must be primed by actuating eight times. If used daily, the pump does not need to be reprimed.
