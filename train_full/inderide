The dosage must be determined by individual titration.
Hydrochlorothiazide can be given at doses of 12.5 to 50 mg per day when used alone. The initial dose of propranolol is 80 mg daily, and it may be increased gradually until optimal blood pressure control is achieved. The usual effective dose when used alone is 160 to 480 mg per day.
One Inderide (propranolol hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide)  Tablet twice daily can be used to administer up to 160 mg of propranolol   and 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. For doses of propranolol greater than 160   mg the combination products are not appropriate, because their use would lead   to an excessive dose of the thiazide component.
When necessary, another antihypertensive agent may be added gradually beginning   with 50 percent of the usual recommended starting dose to avoid an excessive   fall in blood pressure.
