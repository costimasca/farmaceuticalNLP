KANUMA is for intravenous infusion only. Prepare KANUMA using the following steps.
Table 1: Total Infusion Volumes* 
Administer the diluted solution as an intravenous infusion using a low-protein binding infusion set with an in-line, low-protein binding 0.2 micron filter.
Infuse over at least 2 hours. Consider further prolonging the infusion time for patients receiving the 3 mg/kg dose or those who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. A 1-hour infusion may be considered for those patients receiving the 1 mg/kg dose who tolerate the infusion.
KANUMA contains no preservatives; therefore, product should be used immediately after dilution. If immediate use is not possible, the diluted product may be stored up to 24 hours in the refrigerator at 2째C to 8째C (36째F to 46째F). Do not freeze or shake. Protect from light.
