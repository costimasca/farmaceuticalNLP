Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.
Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium - depending on rate of growth - fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6months.
General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis since in some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.
Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response    in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.
For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a daily dose of 1.0 gram is recommended.
Children:Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day    is an effective dose for most children. On this basis the following dosage schedule    for children is suggested:
Children weighing 30 to 50 pounds - 125 mg to 250 mg daily.
Children weighing over 50 pounds - 250mg to 500 mg daily.
