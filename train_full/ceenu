The recommended dose of CeeNU in adult and pediatric patients as a single agent   in previously untreated patients is 130 mg/m² as a single oral dose every   6 weeks (see PATIENT INFORMATION and HOW   SUPPLIED: Directions to the Pharmacist). In individuals with compromised   bone marrow function, the dose should be reduced to 100 mg/m² every 6 weeks.   When CeeNU is used in combination with other myelosuppressive drugs, the doses   should be adjusted accordingly.
Doses subsequent to the initial dose should be adjusted according to the hematologic   response of the patient to the preceding dose. The following schedule is suggested   as a guide to dosage adjustment:
 
A repeat course of CeeNU should not be given until circulating blood elements   have returned to acceptable levels (platelets above 100,000/mm³; leukocytes   above 4000/mm³), and this is usually in 6 weeks. Adequate number of neutrophils   should be present on a peripheral blood smear. Blood counts should be monitored   weekly and repeat courses should not be given before 6 weeks because the hematologic   toxicity is delayed and cumulative.
