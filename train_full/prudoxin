A thin film of PRUDOXIN (doxepin)  Cream should be applied four times each day with at    least a 3 to 4 hour interval between applications. There are no data to establish    the safety and effectiveness of PRUDOXIN (doxepin)  Cream when used for greater than eight    days. Chronic use beyond eight days may result in higher systemic levels.
Clinical experience has shown that drowsiness is significantly more common in patients applying PRUDOXIN (doxepin)  Cream to over 10% of body surface area; therefore, patients with greater than 10% of body surface area affected should be particularly cautioned concerning possible drowsiness and other systemic adverse effects of doxepin.  If excessive drowsiness occurs it may be necessary to do one or more of the following: reduce the body surface area treated, reduce the number of applications per day, reduce the amount of cream applied, or discontinue the drug.
Occlusive dressings may increase the absorption of most topical drugs; therefore, occlusive dressings with PRUDOXIN (doxepin)  Cream should not be utilized.
