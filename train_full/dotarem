For adult and pediatric patients (2 years and older), the recommended dose of DOTAREM is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) body weight administered as an intravenous bolus injection, manually or by power injector, at a flow rate of approximately 2 mL/second for adults and 1-2 mL/second for pediatric patients. Table 1 provides weight-adjusted dose volumes.

To ensure complete injection of DOTAREM the injection may be followed by normal saline flush. Contrast MRI can begin immediately following DOTAREM injection.
Visually inspect DOTAREM for particulate matter prior to administration. Do not use the solution if particulate matter is present or if the container appears damaged. DOTAREM should be a clear, colorless to yellow solution.
Do not mix with other drugs or parenteral nutrition. Discard any unused portions of the drug.
When DOTAREM is to be injected using plastic disposable syringes, the contrast medium should be drawn into the syringe and used immediately.
