The dose is 1 – 2 drops in each eye 4 – 6 times a day at regular intervals.
One drop contains approximately 1.6 mg cromolyn sodium.
Patients should be advised that the effect of cromolyn sodium ophthalmic solution    therapy is dependent upon its administration at regular intervals, as directed.
Symptomatic response to therapy (decreased itching, tearing, redness, and discharge)    is usually evident within a few days, but longer treatment for up to six weeks    is sometimes required. Once symptomatic improvement has been established, therapy    should be continued for as long as needed to sustain improvement.
If required, corticosteroids may be used concomitantly with cromolyn sodium ophthalmic solution.
