The dosage must be determined by individual titration. (See INDICATIONS.)
Chlorthalidone is usually initiated at a dose of 25 mg once daily and may be    increased to 50 mg if the response is insufficient after a suitable trial.
Clonidine hydrochloride is usually initiated at a dose of 0.1 mg twice daily. Elderly patients may benefit from a lower initial dose.
Further increments of 0.1 mg/day may be made if necessary until the desired    response is achieved. The therapeutic doses most commonly employed have ranged    from 0.2 to 0.6 mg per day in divided doses.
One CLORPRES (clonidine hydrochloride and chlorthalidone) Â® (clonidine hydrochloride/chlorthalidone) Tablet administered once or twice daily can be used to administer a minimum of 0.1 mg clonidine hydrochloride and 15 mg chlorthalidone to a maximum of 0.6 mg clonidine hydrochloride and 30 mg chlorthalidone.
