Each dose of PYLERA is 3 capsules. Each dose of all 3 capsules should be taken 4 times a day, after meals and at bedtime for 10 days. One omeprazole 20 mg capsule should be taken twice a day with PYLERA after the morning and evening meal for 10 days (Table 1).
Table 1: Daily Dosing Schedule for PYLERA 
Instruct patients to swallow the PYLERA capsules whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluid, particularly with the bedtime dose, is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration by tetracycline hydrochloride.
If a dose is missed, patients should continue the normal dosing schedule until medication is gone. Patients should not take double doses. If more than 4 doses are missed, the prescriber should be contacted.
