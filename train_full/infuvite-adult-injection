INFUVITE ADULT is a combination product that contains the following vitamins: ascorbic acid, vitamin A, vitamin D, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, dexpanthenol, vitamin E, vitamin K1, folic acid, biotin, and vitamin B12.
INFUVITE ADULT is supplied as a single dose or as a pharmacy bulk package for intravenous use intended for administration by intravenous infusion after dilution.
Patients with multiple vitamin deficiencies or with increased vitamin requirements may need multiple daily dosages as indicated. Some patients do not maintain adequate levels of certain vitamins when this formulation in recommended amounts is the only source of vitamins.
Do not administer INFUVITE ADULT as a direct, undiluted intravenous injection as it may cause dizziness, faintness, and possible tissue irritation.
Blood vitamin concentrations should be monitored to ensure maintenance of adequate levels, particularly in patients receiving parenteral multivitamins as the only source of vitamins for long periods of time.
