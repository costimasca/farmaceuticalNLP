Administer ADCETRIS as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. See Table 1 for the recommended starting dosage.
For classical HL post-auto-HSCT consolidation treatment, initiate ADCETRIS treatment within 4â€“6 weeks post-auto-HSCT or upon recovery from auto-HSCT. These patients should continue treatment until a maximum of 16 cycles, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity.
Table 1: Recommended ADCETRIS Dosage 
For new or worsening Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy, dosing should be held until neuropathy improves to Grade 1 or baseline and then restarted at 1.2 mg/kg. For Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy, ADCETRIS should be discontinued.
The dose of ADCETRIS should be held for Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia until resolution to baseline or Grade 2 or lower. Consider G-CSF prophylaxis for subsequent cycles in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in the previous cycle. In patients with recurrent  Grade 4 neutropenia despite the use of G-CSF prophylaxis, consider discontinuation or dose reduction of ADCETRIS to 1.2 mg/kg.
