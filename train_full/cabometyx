Permanently discontinue CABOMETYX for any of the following:
Reduce the daily CABOMETYX dose by 20 mg (for example, from 60 mg to 40 mg daily or from 40 mg to 20 mg daily). Resume the dose that was used prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the strong inhibitor [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Increase the daily CABOMETYX dose by 20 mg (for example, from 60 mg to 80 mg daily or from 40 mg to 60 mg daily) as tolerated.
