BiDil should be initiated at a dose of one BiDil Tablet, three times a day. Titrate to a maximum of two tablets three times daily, if tolerated.
Although titration of BiDil can be rapid (3-5 days), some patients may experience side effects and may take longer to reach their maximum tolerated dose. The dosage may be decreased to as little as one-half
BiDil Tablet three times a day if intolerable side effects occur. Efforts should be made to titrate up as soon as side effects subside.
