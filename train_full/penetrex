 When only the serum creatinine is known, the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. 
  
 
Men:  creatinine  clearance (mL/min) 
The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. 
Dosage adjustment is not necessary in elderly patients with normal renal function, but dose should be adjusted according to the previous guidelines in elderly patients with compromised renal function.
