PREZCOBIX is a fixed-dose combination product containing 800 mg of darunavir and 150 mg of cobicistat. In treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced adults with no darunavir resistance-associated substitutions, the recommended dosage of PREZCOBIX is one tablet taken once daily orally with food. Administer PREZCOBIX in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents.
HIV genotypic testing is recommended for antiretroviral treatment-experienced patients. However, when HIV genotypic testing is not feasible, PREZCOBIX can be used in protease inhibitor-naïve patients, but is not recommended in protease inhibitor-experienced patients.
Prior to starting PREZCOBIX, assess estimated creatinine clearance because cobicistat decreases estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. When coadministering PREZCOBIX with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) assess estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein at baseline [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
PREZCOBIX co-administered with tenofovir DF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and  ADVERSE REACTIONS].
PREZCOBIX is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
