This package contains Novolin® 70/30 in an InnoLet® disposable prefilled insulin syringe. Novolin 70/30 is a mixture of 70% NPH, Human Insulin Isophane Suspension and 30% Regular, Human Insulin Injection (recombinant DNA origin). The concentration of this product is 100 units of insulin per milliliter. It is a cloudy or milky suspension of human insulin with protamine and zinc. The insulin substance (the cloudy material) settles at the bottom of the insulin reservoir, therefore, the Novolin 70/30 InnoLet  (70% nph, human insulin isophane suspension and 30% regular, human insulin injection) must be rotated up and down so that the contents are uniformly mixed before a dose is given. Novolin 70/30 has an intermediate duration of action. The effect of Novolin 70/30 begins approximately ½ hour after injection. The effect is maximal between 2 and approximately 12 hours. The full duration of action may last up to 24 hours after injection.
