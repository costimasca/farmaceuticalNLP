Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film from two to three times daily depending on the severity of the condition.
Occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions.
If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.
