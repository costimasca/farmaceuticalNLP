Adults and Children 12 Years of Age and Over: 12 Hour Tablet: One tablet twice a day (every 12 hours); 24 Hour Tablet: One tablet daily taken with a full glass of water (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Because the doses of this fixed combination product cannot be individually titrated and hepatic insufficiency results in a reduced clearance of loratadine to a much greater extent than pseudoephedrine, loratadine; pseudoephedrine sulfate extended release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Patients with renal insufficiency (GFR <30 ml/min) should be given a lower initial dose (one 12 hour tablet per day, or one 24 hour tablet every other day) because they have reduced clearance of loratadine and pseudoephedrine. Patients who have a history of difficulty in swallowing tablets or who have known upper gastrointestinal narrowing or abnormal esophageal peristalsis should not use the 24 hour tablet (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for the Patient; and ADVERSE REACTIONS).
