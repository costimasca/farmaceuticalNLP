IMPORTANT: NEBUPENT (pentamidine isethionate)  MUST BE DISSOLVED ONLY IN STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION,   USP. DO NOT USE SALINE SOLUTION FOR RECONSTITUTION BECAUSE THE DRUG WILL PRECIPITATE.   DO NOT MIX THE NEBUPENT (pentamidine isethionate)  SOLUTION WITH ANY OTHER DRUGS. DO NOT USE THE RESPIRGARD®   II NEBULIZER TO ADMINISTER A BRONCHODILATOR.
The contents of one vial (300 mg) must be dissolved in 6 mL Sterile Water for   Injection, USP. Place the entire reconstituted contents of the vial into the   Respirgard® II nebulizer reservoir for administration.
The recommended adult dosage of NebuPent (pentamidine isethionate)  for the prevention of Pneumocystis    jiroveci pneumonia is 300 mg once every four weeks administered via the Respirgard®   II nebulizer.
The dose should be delivered until the nebulizer chamber is empty (approximately   30 to 45 minutes). The flow rate should be 5 to 7 liters per minute from a 40   to 50 pounds per square inch (PSI) air or oxygen source. Alternatively, a 40   to 50 PSI air compressor can be used with flow limited by setting the flowmeter   at 5 to 7 liters per minute or by setting the pressure at 22 to 25 PSI. Low   pressure (less than 20 PSI) compressors should not be used.
Freshly prepared solutions for aerosol use are recommended. After reconstitution   with sterile water, the NebuPent (pentamidine isethionate)  solution is stable for 48 hours in the original   vial at room temperature if protected from light.
