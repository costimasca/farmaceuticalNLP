LUPRON DEPOT (leuprolide acetate for depot suspension injection)  Must Be Administered Under The Supervision Of A Physician.
The recommended dose of LUPRON DEPOT (leuprolide acetate for depot suspension injection) â€“3 Month 22.5 mg to be administered is   one injection every three months (84 days). Due to different release   characteristics, a fractional dose of this 3-month depot formulation is not   equivalent to the same dose of the monthly formulation and should not be given.
Incorporated in a depot formulation, the lyophilized microspheres are to be   reconstituted and administered every three months as a single intramuscular    injection. For optimal performance of the prefilled dual chamber syringe    (PDS), read and follow the following instructions:
forward with the thumb or finger until the device is fully extended and a CLICK is heard or felt. Since the product does not contain a preservative, the suspension should be discarded if not used immediately.
As with other drugs administered by injection, the injection site should be varied periodically.
