Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole)  and   other treatment options before deciding to use PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole) . Use the lowest   effective NAPROSYN dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual   patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).
The recommended PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole)  dose for the risk reduction of NSAID-associated gastric ulcers – in adult patients with a history of a documented gastric ulcer who require the use of an NSAID – for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and/or ankylosing spondylitis is the following:
PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole)  500: One 15 mg PREVACID capsule once daily and one   500 mg NAPROSYN tablet BID (1000 mg of NAPROSYN daily).
In the morning before eating, take the PREVACID capsule and one NAPROSYN tablet with a glass of water. In the evening, take the second NAPROSYN tablet with a glass of water. PREVACID Delayed-Release Capsules should be swallowed whole; they should not be chewed or crushed.
After observing the response to initial therapy with PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole) , the NAPROSYN dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Controlled studies of PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole)  did not extend beyond 12 weeks.
Renal insufficiency patients and geriatric patients do not require adjustment of the 15 mg PREVACID component of PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole) , however dose adjustment should be considered for patients with severe liver disease.
Dose adjustment for the NAPROSYN component of PREVACID NapraPAC (lansoprazole)  should be considered    for geriatric patients and patients with liver disease. NAPROSYN-containing    products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and    severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per minute) (see    WARNINGS, Renal Effects; PRECAUTIONS,    Hepatic Effects; and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric    Use).
