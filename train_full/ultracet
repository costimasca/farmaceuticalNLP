For the short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain, the recommended dose of ULTRACET® is 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief, up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.
In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosing interval of ULTRACET® be increased not to exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, in view of the potential for greater sensitivity to adverse events.
