The determination of optimal dosage requires individual titration. Start therapy at a low dosage and increase gradually until optimum effect is achieved (usually between 40-80 mg daily).
The following dosage titration schedule is suggested:
5 mg three times a day for 3 days 10 mg three times a day for 3 days 15 mg three times a day for 3 days 20 mg three times a day for 3 days
Thereafter additional increases may be necessary but the total daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 80 mg daily (20 mg four times a day).
The lowest dose compatible with an optimal response is recommended. If benefits   are not evident after a reasonable trial period, patients should be slowly withdrawn   from the drug (see WARNINGS, Abrupt Drug   Withdrawal).
Using dry hands, the patient should be instructed to place the tablet on the   tongue, where it will disintegrate and can then be swallowed with or without   water.
Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, it should be given with caution and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with impaired renal function.
