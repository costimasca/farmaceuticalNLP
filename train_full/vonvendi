For intravenous use after reconstitution only.
Physician supervision of the treatment regimen is required.
Administer initial dose of 40 to 80 international units per kg body weight. Dosing guidelines for treatment of minor and major hemorrhages are provided in Table 1. Administer VONVENDI within the designated ranges based on clinical judgment, taking into account severity, site of bleeding, and medical history of the patient. Adjust the dose based on the extent and location of the bleeding episode. Administer subsequent doses as long as clinically required. Monitor appropriate clinical and laboratory measures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Table 1 :Dosing Guidelines for Treatment of Minor and Major Hemorrhages 
The initial dose of VONVENDI should achieve greater than 60% of von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels (based on VWF:RCo greater than 0.6 IU/mL) and an infusion of recombinant factor VIII should achieve factor VIII levels greater than 40% (FVIII:C greater than 0.4 IU/mL). In major bleeding episodes, maintain trough levels of VWF:RCo greater than 50% for as long as deemed necessary.
Administer VONVENDI with recombinant factor VIII if required, to control bleeding. Dosing should be at a ratio of 1.3:1 (i.e., 30% more VONVENDI than recombinant factor VIII, based on the approximate mean recoveries to 1.5 and 2 IU/dL for VONVENDI and recombinant factor VIII, respectively). Administer the complete dose of VONVENDI followed by recombinant factor VIII within 10 minutes.
Calculating dose:
VONVENDI dose [IU] = dose in [IU/kg] x weight [kg]
Recombinant factor VIII dose [IU] = VONVENDI dose divided by 1.3
Example: a patient weighing 70 kg with a type 2 or 3 von Willebrand disease experiencing a major bleed and requiring 80 IU/kg of VONVENDI will be infused 5600 IU of VONVENDI and 4308 IU of recombinant factor VIII for the initial bleeding episode. If required, subsequent dose is 4200 IU of VONVENDI based on 60 IU/kg infused every 8 to 24 hours as per the dosing ranges in Table 1.
If expected VWF activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding episode is not controlled with an appropriate dose, perform an assay that measures the presence of von Willebrand factor or factor VIII inhibitors. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]
