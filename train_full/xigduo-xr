Assess renal function before initiating XIGDUO XR therapy and periodically thereafter.
XIGDUO XR is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [see CONTRAINDICATIONS,  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS,  ADVERSE REACTIONS, and Use in Specific Populations].
No dose adjustment for XIGDUO XR is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater).
Discontinue XIGDUO XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Reevaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart XIGDUO XR if renal function is stable [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
