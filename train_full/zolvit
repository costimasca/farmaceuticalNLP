Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of the pain and the response    of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone    can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is    dose related.
The usual adult dosage is approximately 2 1/4 tea-spoonfuls every 4 to 6 hours    as needed for pain. The total daily dosage for adults should not exceed 131/2    teaspoonfuls. The usual dosages for children are given by the table below, and    are to be given every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. These dosages correspond    to an average individual dose of 0.20 mL/kg of ZOLVIT™ (providing 0.135    mg/kg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 4.0 mg/kg of acetaminophen). Dosing should    be based on weight whenever possible.

The total daily dosage for children should not exceed 6 doses per day. It is    of utmost importance that the dose of ZOLVIT™ be administered accurately.    A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device, especially    when one-half or three-fourths of a teaspoonful is to be measured. Given the    inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon    instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, it is strongly recommended    that care givers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers    should recommend a dropper that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose    accurately, and instruct care givers to use extreme caution in measuring the    dosage.
