Shake well before use. With thorough agitation, HAVRIX is a homogeneous, turbid, white suspension. Do not administer if it appears otherwise. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.
For the prefilled syringes, attach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly.
For the vials, use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to withdraw the vaccine dose and administer intramuscularly. Changing needles between drawing vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient is not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual.
HAVRIX should be administered by intramuscular injection only. HAVRIX should not be administered in the gluteal region; such injections may result in suboptimal response.
Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.
Primary immunization for children and adolescents (12 months through 18 years of age) consists of a single 0.5-mL dose and a 0.5-mL booster dose administered anytime between 6 and 12 months later. The preferred sites for intramuscular injections are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in young children or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in older children.
Primary immunization for adults consists of a single 1-mL dose and a 1-mL booster dose administered anytime between 6 and 12 months later. In adults, the injection should be given in the deltoid region.
