One ORACEA Capsule (40 mg) should be taken once daily in the morning on an empty stomach, preferably at least one hour prior to or two hours after meals. Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with the capsules is recommended to wash down the capsule to reduce the risk of  esophageal irritation and ulceration [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
The dosage of ORACEA differs from that of doxycycline used to treat infections. Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects including the development of resistant organisms.
