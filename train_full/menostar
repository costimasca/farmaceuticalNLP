Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. It is recommended that women who have a uterus and are treated with Menostar receive a progestin for 14 days every 6 to 12 months and undergo an endometrial biopsy at yearly intervals or as clinically indicated in order to detect any endometrial stimulation which might require further clinical action. A women without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [see  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.
Menostar 14 mcg per day applied to a clean dry area of the lower abdomen once weekly.
