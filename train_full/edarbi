The recommended dose in adults is 80 mg taken orally once daily. Consider a starting dose of 40 mg for patients who are treated with high doses of diuretics.
If blood pressure is not controlled with Edarbi alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved by taking Edarbi with other antihypertensive agents.
Edarbi may be taken with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
Do not repackage Edarbi. Dispense and store Edarbi in its original container to protect Edarbi from light and moisture.
No initial dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, patients with mild-to-severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or mild-to-moderate hepatic dysfunction. Edarbi has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
