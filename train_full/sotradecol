Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if precipitated or discolored.
SotradecolÂ® (sodium tetradecyl sulfate injection) is for intravenous use    only. The strength of solution required depends on the size and degree of varicosity.    In general, the 1% solution will be found most useful with the 3% solution preferred    for larger varicosities. The dosage should be kept small, using 0.5 to 2    mL (preferably 1 mL maximum) for each injection, and the maximum single treatment    should not exceed 10 mL.
