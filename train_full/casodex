The recommended dose for CASODEX (bicalutamide)  therapy in combination with an LHRH analog is one 50 mg tablet once daily (morning or evening), with or without food. It is recommended that CASODEX (bicalutamide)  be taken at the same time each day. Treatment with CASODEX (bicalutamide)  should be started at the same time as treatment with an LHRH analog.
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment [see Use    in Specific Populations].
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic    impairment. In patients with severe liver impairment (n=4), although there was    a 76% increase in the half-life (5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients,    respectively) of the active enantiomer of bicalutamide no dosage adjustment    is necessary [see Use in Specific Populations].
