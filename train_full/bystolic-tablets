The dose of BYSTOLIC must be individualized to the needs of the patient. For   most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without   food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring   further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals   up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.
In patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr less than 30 mL/min) the recommended   initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed. BYSTOLIC has   not been studied in patients receiving dialysis [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the recommended initial dose   is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed. BYSTOLIC has not been studied   in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore it is not recommended   in that population [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
It is not necessary to adjust the dose in the elderly [see Use in Specific   Populations].
No dose adjustments are necessary for patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.   The clinical effect and safety profile observed in poor metabolizers were similar   to those of extensive metabolizers [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
