The recommended dosage regimen of ELAPRASE is 0.5 mg per kg of body weight administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
Prepare and use ELAPRASE according to the following steps using aseptic technique:
Administer the diluted ELAPRASE solution to patients using a low-protein-binding infusion set equipped with a low-protein-binding 0.2 micrometer (μm) in-line filter.
The total volume of infusion should be administered over a period of 3 hours, which may be gradually reduced to 1 hour if no hypersensitivity reactions are observed. Patients may require longer infusion times if hypersensitivity reactions occur; however, infusion times should not exceed 8 hours. The initial infusion rate should be 8 mL per hour for the first 15 minutes. If the infusion is well tolerated, the rate of infusion may be increased by 8 mL per hour increments every 15 minutes. The infusion rate should not exceed 100 mL per hour. The infusion rate may be slowed, temporarily stopped, or discontinued for that visit in the event of hypersensitivity reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. ELAPRASE should not be infused with other products in the infusion tubing.
ELAPRASE does not contain preservatives; therefore, after dilution with saline, the infusion bags should be used immediately. If immediate use is not possible, the diluted solution should be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46 °F) for up to 24 hours. Other than during infusion, do not store the diluted ELAPRASE solution at room temperature. Any unused product or waste material should be discarded and disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
