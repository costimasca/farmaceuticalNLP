The recommended dose for BayRab (rabies immune globulin (human) solvent/detergent treated)  is 20 IU/kg (0.133 mL/kg) of body weight given    preferably at the time of the first vaccine dose.8,9 It may also    be given through the seventh day after the first dose of vaccine is given. If    anatomically feasible, up to the full dose of BayRab (rabies immune globulin (human) solvent/detergent treated)  should be thoroughly infiltrated    in the area around the wound and the rest should be administered intramuscularly    in the gluteal area or lateral thigh muscle. Because of risk of injury to the    sciatic nerve, the central region of the gluteal area MUST be avoided; only    the upper, outer quadrant should be used.26 BayRab (rabies immune globulin (human) solvent/detergent treated)  should never be    administered in the same syringe or needle or in the same anatomical site as    vaccine.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
