The recommended dose is a single tablet of FROVA (frovatriptan 2.5 mg) taken orally with fluids.
If the migraine recurs after initial relief, a second tablet may be taken, providing there is an interval of at least 2 hours between doses. The total daily dose of FROVA should not exceed 3 tablets (3 x 2.5 mg per 24 hour period).
There is no evidence that a second dose of FROVA is effective in patients who do not respond to a first dose of the drug for the same headache.
The safety of treating an average of more than 4 migraine attacks in a 30-day period has not been established.
