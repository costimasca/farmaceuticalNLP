Therapy should be individualized according to patient response. Use the smallest dosage necessary to achieve the required response.
The usual adult dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg (10 mL to 20 mL) once or twice a day. Many patients with edema respond to intermittent therapy, i.e., administration on alternate days or on three to five days each week. With an intermittent schedule, excessive response and the resulting undesirable  electrolyte imbalance are less likely to occur.
The usual adult starting dosage is 500 mg or 1000 mg (10 mL to 20 mL) a day as a single or divided dose. Dosage is increased or decreased according to blood pressure response. Rarely some patients may require up to 2000 mg (40 mL) a day in divided doses.
The usual pediatric dosage is 5 mg to 10 mg per pound (10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg)    per day in single or two divided doses, not to exceed 375 mg per day (2.5 mL    to 7.5 mL or ½ to 1½ teaspoonfuls of the oral suspension daily) in infants up    to 2 years of age or 1000 mg per day in children 2 to 12 years of age. In infants    less than 6 months of age, doses up to 15 mg per pound (30 mg/kg) per day in    two divided doses may be required. (See PRECAUTIONS,    Pediatric Use.)
