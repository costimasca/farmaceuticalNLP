Carefully remove all cerumen and debris to allow Acetic Acid Otic Solution to contact infected surfaces directly. To promote continuous contact, insert a wick of cotton saturated with Acetic Acid Otic Solution into the ear canal; the wick may also be saturated after insertion. Instruct the patient to keep the wick in for at least 24 hours and to keep it moist by adding 3 to 5 drops of Acetic Acid Otic Solution every 4 to 6 hours. The wick may be removed after 24 hours but the patient should continue to instill 5 drops of Acetic Acid Otic Solution 3 or 4 times daily thereafter, for as long as indicated. In pediatric patients, 3 to 4 drops may be sufficient due to the smaller capacity of the ear canal.
