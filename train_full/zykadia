The recommended dose of ZYKADIA is 750 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administer ZYKADIA on an empty stomach (i.e., do not administer within 2 hours of a meal) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
A recommended dose has not been determined for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations].
If a dose of ZYKADIA is missed, make up that dose unless the next dose is due within 12 hours.
If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, do not administer an additional dose and continue with the next scheduled dose of ZYKADIA.
Recommendations for dose modifications of ZYKADIA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1.
Approximately 58% of patients initiating treatment at the recommended dose required at least one dose reduction and the median time to first dose reduction was 7 weeks.
Discontinue ZYKADIA for patients unable to tolerate 300 mg daily.
Table 1: ZYKADIA Dose Interruption, Reduction, or Discontinuation Recommendations 
Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with ZYKADIA [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the ZYKADIA dose by approximately one-third, rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dosage strength. After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume the ZYKADIA dose that was taken prior to initiating the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.
