Prochieve® 8% is administered vaginally at a dose of 90 mg once daily in women who require progesterone supplementation. Prochieve® 8% is administered vaginally at a dose of 90 mg twice daily in women with partial or complete ovarian failure who require progesterone replacement. If pregnancy occurs, treatment may be continued until placental autonomy is achieved, up to 10-12 weeks.
Prochieve® 4% is administered vaginally every other day up to a total of six doses. For women who fail to respond, a trial of Prochieve® 8% every other day up to a total of six doses may be instituted.
It is important to note that a dosage increase from the 4% gel can only be accomplished by using the 8% gel. Increasing the volume of gel administered does not increase the amount of progesterone absorbed.

Note: The PATIENT INFORMATION SHEET contains special instructions for using the applicator at altitudes above 2500 feet in order to avoid a partial release of Prochieve® before vaginal insertion.
