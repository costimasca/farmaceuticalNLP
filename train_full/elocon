Apply a thin film of ELOCON Cream to the affected skin areas once daily. ELOCON Cream may be used in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older. Since safety and efficacy of ELOCON Cream have not been established in pediatric patients below 2 years of age; use in this age group is not recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use in Specific Populations].
Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary. Safety and efficacy of ELOCON Cream in pediatric patients for more than 3 weeks of use have not been established.
ELOCON Cream should not be used with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician. ELOCON Cream should not be applied in the diaper area if the child still requires diapers or plastic pants, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressing.
ELOCON Cream is for topical use only. It is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.
Avoid use on the face, groin, or axillae.
