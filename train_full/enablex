The recommended starting dose of Enablex is 7.5 mg once daily. Based upon individual response, the dose may be increased to 15 mg once daily, as early as two weeks after starting therapy.
Enablex should be taken once daily with water. Enablex may be taken with or without food, and should be swallowed whole and not chewed, divided or crushed.
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) or when co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone), the daily dose of Enablex should not exceed 7.5 mg. Enablex is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
