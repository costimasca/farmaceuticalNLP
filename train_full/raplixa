The required amount of Raplixa needed to stop bleeding varies and is based on the size of the bleeding area to be treated. The maximum total dose of Raplixa per surgery is 3 grams. In clinical trials, it was demonstrated that smaller bleeding sites covering an area of less than 10 cm² used 0.5 gram to 1.0 gram of Raplixa. Larger bleeding sites covering an area of 10 - 100 cm² used 1.0 to 2.0 grams of Raplixa to stop bleeding. Using the RaplixaSpray device, 1.0 gram can cover a 100cm² bleeding surface area.
The required dose of Raplixa depends on the size of the bleeding area to be treated according to Table 1 below.
Table 1: Guideline for Raplixa Application
