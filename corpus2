The following safety features should be present: (1) Protection from electrical hazard: All units should be grounded and conform to applicable electrical codes.
 (2) Protective shielding of lamps: The patient should not be able to come in contact with the bare lamps.
 (5) Door and latches: Patients should be able to open the door from the inside with only slight pressure to the door.
 (9) Patient alarm device: An alarm device within the UVA irradiator chamber should be accessible to the patient for emergency activation.
 (10) Danger label: The unit should have a label prominently displayed which reads as follows:
 The maximum radiant exposure or irradiance (within ±15 percent) of UVA (320 – 400 nm) delivered to the patient should be determined by using an appropriate radiometer calibrated to be read in Joules / cm² or mW / cm².
 UVA exposure may be held constant or increased by up to 1.0 Joule / cm² at each treatment, according to the patient's response.
 UVA exposure may be held constant or increased by up to 1.5 Joules / cm² at each treatment unless erythema occurs.
 Schedule Of Exposures: When patients have achieved 95 percent clearing, or Grade 4 response (Table 2), they may be placed on the following maintenance schedules (M1 – M4), in sequence.
 It is recommended that each maintenance schedule be adhered to for at least 2 treatments (unless erythema or psoriatic flare occurs, in which case see (2a) and (2b) below).
 If a flare occurs less than 6 weeks after the last treatment, 25 percent of the maximum exposure received during the clearing phase, may be used and then proceed with the clearing schedule previously followed for this patient.
 When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of A - Methapred (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) sterile powder is 30 mg / kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes.
 In other indications initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the clinical problem being treated.
 It should not be less than 0.5 mg / kg every 24 hours.
 A - Methapred (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) may be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection or by intravenous infusion, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection.
 In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (4 mg of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone).
 Store unreconstituted product at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F).
 Store solution at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F).
 The recommended daily dosage for adults and children is 5 mg / kg given as a single infusion.
 ABELCET® (amphotericin b) should be administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of 2.5 mg / kg / h.
 Withdraw the appropriate dose of ABELCET® (amphotericin b) from the required number of vials into one or more sterile syringes using an 18 - gauge needle.
 Each filter needle may be used to filter the contents of up to four 100 mg vials.
 The final infusion concentration should be 1 mg / mL.
 For pediatric patients and patients with cardiovascular disease the drug may be diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection to a final infusion concentration of 2 mg / mL.
 The diluted ready - for - use admixture is stable for up to 48 hours at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) and an additional 6 hours at room temperature.
 The recommended starting and target dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day administered on a once - a - day schedule without regard to meals.
 ABILIFY has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg / day, when administered as the tablet formulation; however, doses higher than 10 or 15 mg / day were not more effective than 10 or 15 mg / day.
 These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either ABILIFY 15 mg / day or placebo, and observed for relapse [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 10 mg / day.
 Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 mg and 30 mg.
 The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days.
 Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments.
 The 30 mg / day dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg / day dose.
 Adults: The recommended starting dose in adults is 15 mg given once daily as monotherapy and 10 mg to 15 mg given once daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.
 The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg / day, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.
 The dose may be increased to 30 mg / day based on clinical response.
 The safety of doses above 30 mg / day has not been evaluated in clinical trials.
 Pediatrics: The recommended starting dose in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) as monotherapy is 2 mg / day, with titration to 5 mg / day after 2 days, and a target dose of 10 mg / day after 2 additional days.
 Subsequent dose increases, if needed, should be administered in 5 mg / day increments.
 The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY as adjunctive treatment for patients already taking an antidepressant is 2 to 5 mg / day.
 The recommended dosage range is 2 to 15 mg / day.
 Dosage adjustments of up to 5 mg / day should occur gradually, at intervals of no less than 1 week [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dosage range for the treatment of pediatric patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder is 5 to 15 mg / day.
 Dosing should be initiated at 2 mg / day.
 The dose should be increased to 5 mg / day, with subsequent increases to 10 or 15 mg / day if needed.
 Dose adjustments of up to 5 mg / day should occur gradually, at intervals of no less than 1 week [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dosage range for Tourette's Disorder is 5 to 20 mg / day.
 For patients weighing less than 50 kg, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg / day with a target dose of 5 mg / day after 2 days.
 The dose can be increased to 10 mg / day in patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics.
 For patients weighing 50 kg or more, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg / day for 2 days, and then increased to 5 mg / day for 5 days, with a target dose of 10 mg / day on day 8.
 The dose can be increased up to 20 mg / day for patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics.
 Dosage adjustments should occur gradually in increments of 5 mg / day at intervals of no less than 1 week.
 The recommended dose in these patients is 9.75 mg.
 The recommended dosage range is 5.25 to 15 mg. No additional benefit was demonstrated for 15 mg compared to 9.75 mg. A lower dose of 5.25 mg may be considered when clinical factors warrant.
 If agitation warranting a second dose persists following the initial dose, cumulative doses up to a total of 30 mg / day may be given.
 The safety of total daily doses greater than 30 mg or injections given more frequently than every 2 hours have not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies].
 If ongoing ABILIFY therapy is clinically indicated, oral ABILIFY in a range of 10 to 30 mg / day should replace ABILIFY injection as soon as possible [see Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder sections above].
 The oral solution can be substituted for tablets on a mg - per - mg basis up to the 25 mg dose level.
 Patients receiving 30 mg tablets should receive 25 mg of the solution [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended starting and maintenance dose of ABILIFY MAINTENA is 400 mg monthly (no sooner than 26 days after the previous injection).
 After the first ABILIFY MAINTENA injection, administer oral aripiprazole (10 mg to 20 mg) for 14 consecutive days to achieve therapeutic aripiprazole concentrations during initiation of therapy.
 If there are adverse reactions with the 400 mg dosage, consider reducing the dosage to 300 mg once monthly.
 Dosage adjustments for 200 mg and 160 mg are obtained only by using the 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials for intramuscular deltoid or gluteal injection.
 There are two aripiprazole formulations for intramuscular use with different dosages, dosing frequencies, and indications.
 In contrast, aripiprazole injection (9.75 mg per vial) is a short - acting formulation indicated for agitation in patients with schizophrenia or mania.
 See instructions for reconstitution / injection / disposal procedures for 1) Pre - filled Dual Chamber Syringe available in 300 mg or 400 mg strength syringes [see section below], and 2) Single - use vials available in 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials [see section below].
 The 200 mg and 160 mg dosage adjustments are obtained only by using the 300 mg or 400 mg strength vials.

 (c) Slowly inject the recommended volume as a single intramuscular injection into the deltoid or gluteal muscle.
 Administer ABLAVAR as an intravenous bolus injection, manually or by power injection, at a dose of 0.12 mL / kg body weight (0.03 mmol / kg) over a period of time up to 30 seconds followed by a 25 - 30 mL normal saline flush.
 (See Table 1 for weight - adjusted dose volumes).
 Begin steady state imaging after dynamic imaging has been completed, generally 5 to 7 minutes following ABLAVAR administration.
 After failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, the recommended regimen for ABRAXANE is 260 mg / m² administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.
 The recommended dose of ABRAXANE is 100 mg / m² administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21 - day cycle.
 The recommended dose of ABRAXANE is 125 mg / m² administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 - 40 minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 - day cycle.
 For patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than ULN and less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] less than or equal to 10 x ULN), no dose adjustments are required, regardless of indication.
 Table 1: Recommendations for Starting Dose in Patients with Hepatic Impairment
 Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 500 cells / mm³ for a week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during ABRAXANE therapy should have dosage reduced to 220 mg / m² for subsequent courses of ABRAXANE.
 For recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy, additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg / m².
 For Grade 3 sensory neuropathy hold treatment until resolution to Grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of ABRAXANE [see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.
 Aseptically, reconstitute each vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 Slowly inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of 1 minute, using the sterile syringe to direct the solution flow onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL.
 Each mL of the reconstituted formulation will contain 5 mg / mL paclitaxel.
 Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg / mL suspension required for the patient and slowly withdraw the dosing volume of the reconstituted suspension from the vial(s) into a syringe: Dosing volume (mL)=Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg / mL).
 Unopened vials of ABRAXANE are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored between 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) in the original package.
 Reconstituted ABRAXANE in the vial should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for a maximum of 24 hours if necessary.
 The suspension for infusion when prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and protected from bright light for a maximum of 24 hours.
 The recommended dosage range for ABSORICA is 0.5 to 1 mg / kg / day given in two divided doses without regard to meals for 15 to 20 weeks (see Table 1).
 In trials comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg / kg / day, it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages.
 Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg / kg / day, as tolerated.
 Begin titration of all patients with an initial dose of ABSTRAL of 100 mcg.
 Start all patients with a single 100 mcg tablet.
 Increase the dose by 100 mcg multiples up to 400 mcg as needed.
 If adequate analgesia is not obtained with a 400 mcg dose, the next titration step is 600 mcg.
 If adequate analgesia is not obtained with a 600 mcg dose, the next titration step is 800 mcg.
 During titration, patients can be instructed to use multiples of 100 mcg tablets and / or 200 mcg tablets for any single dose.
 Instruct patients not to use more than 4 tablets at one time.
 No more than two doses of ABSTRAL may be used to treat an episode of breakthrough pain.
 The efficacy and safety of doses higher than 800 mcg have not been evaluated in clinical studies in patients.
 The initial dose of Abstral is always 100 mcg with the only exception being patients already using Actiq.
 For patients converting from Actiq doses 400 mcg and below, initiate titration with 100 mcg Abstral and proceed using multiples of this strength.
 c. For patients converting from Actiq doses of 600 and 800 mcg, initiate titration with 200 mcg and 200 mcg Abstral, respectively and proceed using multiples of this strength.
 d. For patients converting from Actiq doses of 1200 and 1600 mcg, initiate titration with 200 mcg and 400 mcg Abstral, respectively and proceed using multiples of this strength.
 Once an appropriate dose for pain management has been established, instruct patients to use only one ABSTRAL tablet of the appropriate strength per dose.
 No more than two doses of ABSTRAL may be used to treat an episode of breakthrough pain.
 ACAM2000 is reconstituted by addition of 0.3 mL of diluent to the vial containing lyophilized vaccine.
 Note: this 0.3 mL of diluent is not the entire content of the diluent vial.
 ACAM2000 should only be reconstituted with 0.3 mL of the diluent provided.
 Using aseptic technique and a sterile 1 mL syringe fitted with a 25 gauge x 5 / 8” needle (provided), draw up 0.3 mL of diluent and transfer the entire content of the syringe to the vaccine vial.
 The needle will pick up a droplet of vaccine (0.0025 mL) within the fork of the bifurcation.
 A semipermeable dressing is one that allows for the passage of air but does not allow for the passage of fluids.
 The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in adults and children 12 years and older is 20 mg twice daily.
 The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in children 5 through 11 years of age is 10 mg twice daily.
 In clinical trials, a dose of 20 mg twice daily was not associated with an increase in the overall incidence of adverse events or withdrawals because of adverse events in elderly patients.
 The clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis such that the Cmax and AUC are approximately 50 - 60% greater than those of normal adults.
 Growth hormone deficiency - The recommended weekly dose is 0.18 mg / kg body weight to 0.3 mg / kg (0.90 IU / kg) body weight.
 Turner Syndrome - The recommended weekly dose is 0.36 mg / kg of body weight.
 Vials of Accretropin™ (somatropin injection) Injection should be stored in the refrigerator [2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F)].
 Once opened, Accretropin™ (somatropin injection) may be stored up to 14 days when refrigerated [2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F)].
 The usual starting dosage for patients 2 to 12 years of age is 1.25 mg or 0.63 mg of AccuNeb (albuterol sulfate inhalation solution) administered 3 or 4 times daily, as needed, by nebulization.
 To administer 1.25 mg or 0.63 mg of albuterol, use the entire contents of one unit - dose vial (3 mL of 1.25 mg or 0.63 mg inhalation solution) by nebulization.
 Patients 6 to 12 years of age with more severe asthma (baseline FEV1 less than 60% predicted), weight > 40 kg, or patients 11 to 12 years of age may achieve a better initial response with the 1.25 mg dose.
 A 2.5 mg dose of albuterol provided by a higher concentration product (2.5 mg albuterol per 3 mL) may be more appropriate for treating acute exacerbations, particularly in children 6 years old and above.
 The recommended initial dosage of ACCUPRIL in patients not on diuretics is 10 or 20 mg once daily.
 Most patients have required dosages of 20, 40, or 80 mg / day, given as a single dose or in two equally divided doses.
 In general, doses of 40 – 80 mg and divided doses give a somewhat greater effect at the end of the dosing interval.
 If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg ACCUPRIL should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized.
 The recommended initial dosage of ACCUPRIL in elderly patients is 10 mg given once daily followed by titration (as described above) to the optimal response.
 The recommended starting dose is 5 mg twice daily.
 Therefore, if the initial dosage of ACCUPRIL is well tolerated, patients should then be titrated at weekly intervals until an effective dose, usually 20 to 40 mg daily given in two equally divided doses, is reached or undesirable hypotension, orthostatis, or azotemia (see WARNINGS) prohibit reaching this dose.
 In patients with heart failure and renal impairment, the recommended initial dose of ACCUPRIL is 5 mg in patients with a creatinine clearance above 30 mL / min and 2.5 mg in patients with a creatinine clearance of 10 to 30 mL / min.
 As individual monotherapy, quinapril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 10 to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg.
 In clinical trials of quinapril / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using quinapril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component.
 In clinical trials of ACCURETIC, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received HCTZ 6.25 mg in the combination, and the average subject who received 10 to 40 / 12.5 to 25 mg experienced a milder reduction in serum potassium than that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.
 Patients whose blood pressures are not adequately controlled with quinapril monotherapy may instead be given ACCURETIC 10 / 12.5 or 20 / 12.5.
 Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control with less electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to ACCURETIC 10 / 12.5 or 20 / 12.5.
 For convenience, patients who are adequately treated with 20 mg of quinapril and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and experience no significant electrolyte disturbances may instead wish to receive ACCURETIC 20 / 25.
 Regimens of therapy with ACCURETIC need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL / min / 1.73 m² (serum creatinine roughly ≤ 3 mg / dL or 265 μmol / L).
 The recommended dosage range for Accutane (isotretinoin) is 0.5 to 1.0 mg / kg / day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks.
 In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg / kg / day,8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages.
 Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2.0 mg / kg / day, as tolerated.
 In patients with essential hypertension, the recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day.
 The dose may be titrated, as needed to a maximum of 16 mg per day.
 The usual maintenance dose range is 4 mg to 8 mg administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses.
 The recommended initial daily dosage of ACEON for the elderly is 4 mg daily, given in one or two divided doses.
 Experience with ACEON is limited in the elderly at doses exceeding 8 mg.
 Dosages above 8 mg should be administered with careful blood pressure monitoring and dose titration [see Use In Specific Populations].
 In patients with stable coronary artery disease, ACEON should be given at an initial dose of 4 mg once daily for 2 weeks, and then increased as tolerated, to a maintenance dose of 8 mg once daily.
 In elderly patients (greater than 70 years), ACEON should be given as a 2 mg dose once daily in the first week, followed by 4 mg once daily in the second week and 8 mg once daily for maintenance dose if tolerated.
 ACEON is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL / min.
 For patients with lesser degrees of impairment, the initial dosage should be 2 mg / day and dosage should not exceed 8 mg / day.
 The total dose of Acetadote is 300 mg / kg given as 3 separate doses and administered over a total of 21 hours.
 Loading Dose: 150 mg / kg diluted in 3 mL / kg of diluent* administered over 1 hr

 The dose of Acetadote recommended in these patients should be a loading dose of 15,000 mg infused over a period of one hour followed by a first maintenance dose of 5,000 mg over 4 hours and a second maintenance dose of 10,000 mg over 16 hours (See Table 3).
 As Acetadote is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol / L), caution is advised when the diluent volume is decreased as the hyperosmolarity of the solution is increased.
 Single dose vial, preservative - free, discard unused portion.
 The dosage employed in the treatment of chronic simple (open - angle) glaucoma ranges from 250 mg to 1 g of acetaZOLAMIDE per 24 hours, usually in divided doses for amounts over 250 mg.
 It has usually been found that a dosage in excess of 1 g per 24 hours does not produce an increased effect.
 In treatment of secondary glaucoma and in the preoperative treatment of some cases of acute congestive (closed - angle) glaucoma, the preferred dosage is 250 mg every four hours, although some cases have responded to 250 mg twice daily on short - term therapy.
 In some acute cases, it may be more satisfactory to administer an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 125 mg or 250 mg every four hours depending on the individual case.
 The suggested total daily dose is 8 to 30 mg per kg in divided doses.
 Although some patients respond to a low dose, the optimum range appears to be from 375 to 1000 mg daily.
 However, some investigators feel that daily doses in excess of 1 g do not produce any better results than a 1 g dose.
 When acetaZOLAMIDE is given in combination with other anticonvulsants, it is suggested that the starting dose should be 250 mg once daily in addition to the existing medications.
 For diuresis in congestive heart failure, the starting dose is usually 250 to 375 mg once daily in the morning (5 mg / kg).
 Recommended dosage is 250 to 375 mg of acetaZOLAMIDE once a day for one or two days, alternating with a day of rest.
 Dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, in divided doses using tablets or sustained - release capsules as appropriate.
 In circumstances of rapid ascent, such as in rescue or military operations, the higher dose level of 1000 mg is recommended.
 It is preferable to initiate dosing 24 to 28 hours before ascent and to continue for 48 hours while at high altitude, or longer as necessary to control symptoms.
 Preparation and Storage of Parenteral Solution: Each 500 mg vial containing sterile acetazolamide sodium should be reconstituted with at least 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection prior to use.
 Reconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical properties for 3 days under refrigeration at 2° - 8° C (36° - 46° F), or 12 hours at room temperature 15° - 30° C (59° - 86° F).
 The dosage employed in the treatment of chronic simple (open - angle) glaucoma ranges from 250 mg to 1 g of acetazolamide per 24 hours, usually in divided doses for amounts over 250 mg.
 It has usually been found that a dosage in excess of 1 g per 24 hours does not produce an increased effect.
 In treatment of secondary glaucoma and in the preoperative treatment of some cases of acute congestive (closed - angle) glaucoma, the preferred dosage is 250 mg every four hours, although some cases have responded to 250 mg twice daily on short - term therapy.
 In some acute cases, it may be more satisfactory to administer an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 125 or 250 mg every four hours depending on the individual case.
 The suggested total daily dose is 8 to 30 mg per kg in divided doses.
 Although some patients respond to a low dose, the optimum range appears to be from 375 to 1000 mg daily.
 However, some investigators feel that daily doses in excess of 1 g do not produce any better results than a 1 g dose.
 When acetazolamide is given in combination with other anticonvulsants, it is suggested that the starting dose should be 250 mg once daily in addition to the existing medications.
 Congestive Heart Failure: For diuresis in congestive heart failure, the starting dose is usually 250 to 375 mg once daily in the morning (5 mg per kg).
 Drug - Induced Edema: Recommended dosage is 250 to 375 mg of acetazolamide once a day for one or two days, alternating with a day of rest.
 Instruct the patient to keep the wick in for at least 24 hours and to keep it moist by adding 3 to 5 drops of Acetic Acid Otic Solution every 4 to 6 hours.
 The wick may be removed after 24 hours but the patient should continue to instill 5 drops of Acetic Acid Otic Solution 3 or 4 times daily thereafter, for as long as indicated.
 In pediatric patients, 3 to 4 drops may be sufficient due to the smaller capacity of the ear canal.
 Acetylcysteine Solution, USP (n - acetyl - l - cysteine) is available in rubber stoppered glass vials containing 10 mL or 30 mL.
 Nebulization - Face Mask, Mouthpiece, Tracheostomy: When nebulized into a face mask, mouthpiece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution three to four times a day.
 This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period.
 If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 10 or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period.
 Direct Instillation: When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour.
 When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy.
 Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter.
 One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter.
 Diagnostic Bronchograms: For diagnostic bronchial studies, 2 or 3 administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure.
 Acetaminophen Assays - Interpretation and Methodology: The acute ingestion of acetaminophen in quantities of 150 mg / kg or greater may result in hepatic toxicity.

 In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 7 - 9) start AGRYLIN therapy at a dose of 0.5 mg / day and monitor frequently for cardiovascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The dose increase increment should not exceed 0.5 mg / day in any one week.
 In the event of dosage interruption or treatment withdrawal, the rebound in platelet count is variable, but platelet counts typically will start to rise within 4 days and return to baseline levels in one to two weeks, possibly rebounding above baseline values.
 AIRDUO RESPICLICK should be administered as one inhalation twice daily by the orally inhaled route only.
 AIRDUO RESPICLICK should be administered as 1 inhalation twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) by the orally inhaled route.
 The usual recommended starting dose for patients not on inhaled corticosteroids is 55 / 14 mcg twice daily.
 For patients switching to AIRDUO RESPICLICK from another inhaled corticosteroid or combination product, select the low (55 / 14 mcg), medium (113 / 14 mcg) or high (232 / 14 mcg) dose strength of AIRDUO RESPICLICK based on the strength of the previous inhaled corticosteroid product or the strength of the inhaled corticosteroid from a combination product and disease severity.
 The highest recommended dose of AIRDUO RESPICLICK is 232 / 14 mcg twice daily.
 After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.
 When the dose counter reaches 20, the color of the numbers will change to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist for a refill of medication or consult their physician for a prescription refill.
 A syringe, filled with fluorescein, is attached to transparent tubing and a 25 gauge scalp vein needle for injection.
 If potential allergy is suspected, an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous administration, i.e., 0.05 mL injection intradermally to be evaluated 30 to 60 minutes following injection.
 For pediatric patients, the dose is calculated on the basis of 35 mg for each ten pounds of body weight.
 Oral: One tablet one to three times daily.
 Parkinson's Disease: Oral: The usual beginning dose is one tablet three or four times daily.
 The dosage should be individualized with the dose titrated upward to a maximum of 8 tablets (16 mg) per 24 hours.
 The recommended dosages for the treatment of clinically important hypotension in the setting of anesthesia is an initial dose of 5 to 10 mg administered by intravenous bolus.

 For bolus intravenous administration, prepare a solution containing a final concentration of 5 mg / mL of AKOVAZ (ephedrine sulfate injection):
 The recommended dose of Akten™ (lidocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic gel) is 2 drops applied to the ocular surface in the area of the planned procedure.
 The recommended dosage in adults is one capsule of AKYNZEO administered approximately 1 hour prior to the start of chemotherapy with dexamethasone 12 mg administered orally 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy on day 1 and 8 mg orally once daily on days 2 to 4 [see Clinical Studies, Table 5].
 The recommended dosage in adults is one capsule of AKYNZEO approximately 1 hour prior to the start of chemotherapy with dexamethasone 12 mg administered orally 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy on day 1.
 The recommended dose is one to two drops in each affected eye four times daily.
 200 mL per liter gives a solution which is approximately isotonic and iso - osmotic with citrated plasma.
 When undiluted albumin solution is administered in patients with normal blood volume, the rate of infusion should be slow enough (1 mL per minute) to prevent too rapid expansion of plasma volume.
 In the treatment of hypoproteinemia, 200 to 300 mL of 25% albumin may be required to reduce edema and to bring serum protein values to normal.
 Since such patients usually have approximately normal blood volume, doses of more than 100 mL of 25% albumin should not be given faster than 100 mL in 30 to 45 minutes to avoid circulatory embarrassment.
 If slower administration is desired, 200 mL of 25% albumin may be mixed with 300 mL of 10% dextrose solution and administered by continuous drip at a rate of 100 mL of this dextrose solution an hour.
 For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of asthmatic symptoms, the usual dosage for adults and children 4 years of age and older is two inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours.
 In some patients, one inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient.
 Each actuation of PROVENTIL® HFA Inhalation Aerosol delivers 108 mcg of albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base) from the mouthpiece.
 The usual dosage for adults and children 4 years of age and older is two inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.
 Instill 1 drop every 5 to 10 minutes for 5 to 7 doses.
 Instill 1 or 2 drops 2 or 3 minutes before removal of stitches.
 Instill 1 or 2 drops prior to operating.
 Instill 1 or 2 drops immediately before measurement.
 The usual maintenance dose of ALDACTAZIDE is 100 mg each of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide daily, administered in a single dose or in divided doses, but may range from 25 mg to 200 mg of each component daily depending on the response to the initial titration.
 Although the dosage will vary depending on the results of titration of the individual ingredients, many patients will be found to have an optimal response to 50 mg to 100 mg each of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide daily, given in a single dose or in divided doses.
 ALDACTONE is administered at a daily dosage of 400 mg for three to four weeks.
 ALDACTONE is administered at a daily dosage of 400 mg for four days.
 After the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism has been established by more definitive testing procedures, ALDACTONE may be administered in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery.
 An initial daily dosage of 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily.
 When given as the sole agent for diuresis, ALDACTONE should be continued for at least five days at the initial dosage level, after which it may be adjusted to the optimal therapeutic or maintenance level administered in either single or divided daily doses.
 For adults, an initial daily dosage of 50 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended.
 ALDACTONE in a dosage ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg daily is useful in treating a diuretic - induced hypokalemia, when oral potassium supplements or other potassium - sparing regimens are considered inappropriate.
 Treatment should be initiated with ALDACTONE 25 mg once daily if the patient's serum potassium is ≤ 5.0 mEq / L and the patient's serum creatinine is ≤ 2.5 mg / dL.
 Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated.
 Patients who do not tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day.
 The treatment area is defined as one contiguous area of approximately 25 cm2 (e.g., 5 cm × 5 cm) on the face (e.g., forehead or one cheek) or on the scalp.
 The usual starting dosage of ALDOMET (methyldopa) is 250 mg two or three times a day in the first 48 hours.
 When ALDOMET (methyldopa) is given with antihypertensives other than thiazides, the initial dosage of ALDOMET (methyldopa) should be limited to 500 mg daily in divided doses; when ALDOMET (methyldopa) is added to a thiazide, the dosage of thiazide need not be changed.
 The usual daily dosage of ALDOMET (methyldopa) is 500 mg to 2 g in two to four doses.
 Although occasional patients have responded to higher doses, the maximum recommended daily dosage is 3 g. Once an effective dosage range is attained, a smooth blood pressure response occurs in most patients in 12 to 24 hours.
 A thiazide may be added at any time during methyldopa therapy and is recommended if therapy has not been started with a thiazide or if effective control of blood pressure cannot be maintained on 2 g of methyldopa daily.
 Initial dosage is based on 10 mg / kg of body weight daily in two to four doses.
 The maximum dosage is 65 mg / kg or 3 g daily, whichever is less.
 The usual starting dosage is one tablet of ALDORIL (methyldopa - hydrochlorothiazide) 15 two or three times a day or one tablet of ALDORIL (methyldopa - hydrochlorothiazide) 25 two times a day.
 Alternatively, one tablet of ALDORIL (methyldopa - hydrochlorothiazide) D30 or ALDORIL (methyldopa - hydrochlorothiazide) D50 once daily may be used.
 Hydrochlorothiazide doses greater than 50 mg daily should be avoided.
 Hydrochlorothiazide can be given at doses of 12.5 to 50 mg per day when used alone.
 The usual daily dosage of methyldopa is 500 mg to 2 g. To minimize the sedation associated with methyldopa, start dosage increases in the evening.
 The maximum recommended daily dose of methyldopa is 3 g.
 When ALDORIL (methyldopa - hydrochlorothiazide) is given with antihypertensives other than thiazides, the initial dosage of methyldopa should be limited to 500 mg daily in divided doses and the dose of these other agents may need to be adjusted to effect a smooth transition.
 The recommended dosage regimen of ALDURAZYME is 0.58 mg / kg of body weight administered once weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion.
 Each vial of ALDURAZYME provides 2.9 milligrams (mg) of laronidase in 5.0 milliliters (mL) of solution and is intended for single use only.
 The concentrated solution for infusion must be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final volume of 100 mL or 250 mL, using aseptic techniques.
 Patients with a body weight of 20 kg or less should receive a total volume of 100 mL.
 Patients with a body weight greater than 20 kg should receive a total volume of 250 mL.
 For patients with underlying cardiac or respiratory compromise and weighing up to 30 kg, physicians may consider diluting ALDURAZYME in a volume of 100 mL and administering at a decreased infusion rate [see Instructions for Use below, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 Prepare ALDURAZYME using low - protein - binding containers and administer with a low - protein - binding infusion set equipped with an in - line, low - protein - binding 0.2 micrometer (μm) filter.
 Table 1: Incremental Rates for 100 mL ALDURAZYME® Infusion (For use with Patients Weighing 20 kg or Less)
 Table 2: Incremental Rates for 250 mL ALDURAZYME® Infusion (For use with Patients Weighing Greater than 20 kg)

 The recommended dose of ALECENSA is 600 mg orally twice daily with food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Discontinue if patients are unable to tolerate the 300 mg twice daily dose.
 The dosage of ALESSE (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol) - 28 is one pink tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one lightgreen inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to the prescribed schedule.
 One pink tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light - green inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 One pink tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light - green inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 The patient begins her next and all subsequent courses of tablets on the day after taking her last light - green tablet.
 If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a nonhormonal back - up method of birth control until she has taken a pink tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 When the patient is switching from a 28 - day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of ALESSE (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol) on the day after her last tablet.
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two pink tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled pink tablets are missed.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken.
 See Dosage Guidelines for the use of ALFENTA (alfenta (alfenta (alfentanil) nil) nil) : 1) by incremental injection as an analgesic adjunct to anesthesia with barbiturate / nitrous oxide / oxygen for short surgical procedures (expected duration of less than one hour); 2) by continuous infusion as a maintenance analgesic with nitrous oxide / oxygen for general surgical procedures; and 3) by intravenous injection in anesthetic doses for the induction of anesthesia for general surgical procedures with a minimum expected duration of 45 minutes; and 4) by intravenous injection as the analgesic component for monitored anesthesia care (MAC).
 Changes in vital signs that indicate a response to surgical stress or lightening of anesthesia may be controlled by increasing the alfenta (alfenta (alfenta (alfentanil) nil) nil) nil to a maximum of 4 mcg / kg / min and / or administration of bolus doses of 7 mcg / kg.
 If changes are not controlled after three bolus doses given over a five minute period, a barbiturate, vasodilator, and / or inhalation agent should be used.
 Rather than an increase in infusion rate, 7 mcg / kg bolus doses of ALFENTA (alfenta (alfenta (alfentanil) nil) nil) or a potent inhalation agent should be administered in response to signs of lightening of anesthesia within the last 15 minutes of surgery.
 Clinical studies of ALFENTA (alfenta (alfenta (alfentanil) nil) nil) infusion have been conducted with ALFENTA (alfenta (alfenta (alfentanil) nil) nil) diluted to a concentration range of 25 mcg / mL to 80 mcg / mL.
 As an example of the preparation of ALFENTA (alfentanil) for infusion, 20 mL of ALFENTA (alfenta (alfenta (alfentanil) nil) nil) added to 230 mL of diluent provides 40 mcg / mL solution of ALFENTA (alfenta (alfenta (alfentanil) nil) nil) .
 Storage: Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).
 See Dosage Guidelines for the use of Alfentanil HCl injection: 1) by incremental injection as an analgesic adjunct to anesthesia with barbiturate / nitrous oxide / oxygen for short surgical procedures (expected duration of less than one hour); 2) by continuous infusion as a maintenance analgesic with nitrous oxide / oxygen for general surgical procedures; and 3) by intravenous injection in anesthetic doses for the induction of anesthesia for general surgical procedures with a minimum expected duration of 45 minutes; and 4) by intravenous injection as the analgesic component for monitored anesthesia care (MAC).
 Continuous Infusion: 0.5 to 3 mcg / kg / min administered with nitrous oxide / oxygen in patients undergoing general surgery.
 Following an anesthetic induction dose of Alfentanil HCl injection , infusion rate requirements are reduced by 30 to 50% for the first hour of maintenance.
 Changes in vital signs that indicate a response to surgical stress or lightening of anesthesia may be controlled by increasing the alfentanil to a maximum of 4 mcg / kg / min and / or administration of bolus doses of 7 mcg / kg.
 If changes are not controlled after three bolus doses given over a five minute period, a barbiturate, vasodilator, and / or inhalation agent should be used.
 Rather than an increase in infusion rate, 7 mcg / kg bolus doses of Alfentanil HCl injection or a potent inhalation agent should be administered in response to signs of lightening of anesthesia within the last 15 minutes of surgery.
 Clinical studies of Alfentanil HCl injection infusion have been conducted with Alfentanil HCl injection diluted to a concentration range of 25 mcg / mL to 80 mcg / mL.
 As an example of the preparation of Alfentanil HCl injection for infusion, 20 mL of Alfentanil HCl injection added to 230 mL of diluent provides 40 mcg / mL solution of Alfentanil.
 Store at 20° to 25°C (68 to 77°F).
 The recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg / m² administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle.
 The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m² infused over 2 hours beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of ALIMTA administration.

 Patients must also receive one (1) intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 during the week preceding the first dose of ALIMTA and every 3 cycles thereafter.
 In clinical trials, the dose of folic acid studied ranged from 350 to 1000 mcg, and the dose of vitamin B12 was 1000 mcg.
 The most commonly used dose of oral folic acid in clinical trials was 400 mcg [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 In clinical trials, dexamethasone 4 mg was given by mouth twice daily the day before, the day of, and the day after ALIMTA administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Patients should not begin a new cycle of treatment unless the ANC is ≥ 1500 cells / mm³, the platelet count is > 100,000 cells / mm³, and creatinine clearance is ≥ 45 mL / min.
 Therefore, ALIMTA should not be administered to patients whose creatinine clearance is < 45 mL / min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula (below) or GFR measured by Tc99m - DPTA serum clearance method:
 Caution should be exercised when administering ALIMTA concurrently with NSAIDs to patients whose creatinine clearance is < 80 mL / min [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 ALINIA tablets should not be administered to pediatric patients 11 years of age or younger because a single tablet contains a greater amount of nitazoxanide than the recommended dosing in this pediatric age group.
 Multiple Myeloma: The usual oral dose is 6 mg (3 tablets) daily.
 When the white blood cell and platelet counts are rising, a maintenance dose of 2 mg daily may be instituted.
 Osserman and Takatsuki have used an initial course of 10 mg / day for 7 to 10 days.
 Continuous maintenance therapy with 2 mg / day is instituted when the white blood cell count is greater than 4,000 cells / mcL and the platelet count is greater than 100,000 cells / mcL.
 Dosage is adjusted to between 1 and 3 mg / day depending upon the hematological response.
 It is desirable to try to maintain a significant degree of bone marrow depression so as to keep the leukocyte count in the range of 3,000 to 3,500 cells / mcL.
 Hoogstraten et al have started treatment with 0.15 mg / kg / day for 7 days.
 The maintenance dose is 0.05 mg / kg / day or less and is adjusted according to the blood count.
 Available evidence suggests that about one third to one half of the patients with multiple myeloma show a favorable response to oral administration of the drug.
 One study by Alexanian et al has shown that the use of ALKERAN (melphalan) in combination with prednisone significantly improves the percentage of patients with multiple myeloma who achieve palliation.
 One regimen has been to administer courses of ALKERAN (melphalan) at 0.25 mg / kg / day for 4 consecutive days (or, 0.20 mg / kg / day for 5 consecutive days) for a total dose of 1 mg / kg / course.
 Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: One commonly employed regimen for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma has been to administer ALKERAN (melphalan) at a dose of 0.2 mg / kg daily for 5 days as a single course.
 The usual IV dose is 16 mg / m².
 Dosage reduction of up to 50% should be considered in patients with renal insufficiency (BUN ≥ 30 mg / dL) (see PRECAUTIONS: General).
 The drug is administered as a single infusion over 15 to 20 minutes.
 Available evidence suggests about one third to one half of the patients with multiple myeloma show a favorable response to the drug.
 The recommended dose of ALLEGRA - D (fexofenadine hcl and pseudoephedrine hcl) 12 HOUR Extended - Release Tablets is one tablet twice daily administered on an empty stomach with water for adults and children 12 years of age and older.
 A dose of one tablet once daily is recommended as the starting dose in patients with decreased renal function.
 The recommended dose of ALLEGRA - D 24 HOUR (fexofenadine hcl 180 and pseudoephendrine hcl 240) Extended - Release Tablets is one tablet once daily administered on an empty stomach with water for adults and children 12 years of age and older.
 The recommended starting dose of AllerNaze (triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray) for most patients is 200 mcg per day given as 2 sprays (approximately 50 mcg / spray) in each nostril once a day.
 The maximum dose should not exceed 400 mcg per day.
 If the 400 mcg dose is used, it may be given either as a once a day dosage (4 sprays in each nostril) or divided into two daily doses of two sprays / nostril twice a day.
 Some patients may obtain relief of symptoms sooner when started on a 400 mcg per day dose of AllerNaze (triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray) than with 200 mcg per day.
 A starting dose of 400 mcg per day may be considered in patients when starting therapy with AllerNaze (triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray) in cases where a faster onset of relief is desirable.
 The recommended dose of alli (orlistat 60 mg) for overweight adults 18 years and older is 1 60 - mg capsule with each meal containing fat.
 If you stop using alli (orlistat 60 mg) , continue with a diet and exercise program.
 If you start to regain weight after you stop taking alli (orlistat 60 mg) , you may need to start taking alli (orlistat 60 mg) again along with your diet and exercise program.
 Take a multivitamin once a day, at bedtime, when using alli (orlistat 60 mg) capsules.
 Butalbital and Acetaminophen, 50 mg / 325 mg tablets: One or two tablets every four hours as needed.

 The dose for adults and children greater than two years of age is one to two drops in each affected eye four times daily for up to 3 months.
 In adults, in one clinical trial, doses over 600 mg a day did not appear to be more effective.
 In both adults and children, the daily dose can be given as single infusion or in equally divided infusions at 6 - , 8 - , or 12 - hour intervals at the recommended final concentration of not greater than 6 mg / mL (see Preparation of Solution).
 The contents of each 30 mL vial should be dissolved with 25 mL of Sterile Water for Injection.
 The solution should be stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) and administration should begin within 10 hours after reconstitution.
 For treatment of moderate - to - severe vasomotor symptoms, vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure, treatment is usually initiated with Alora 0.05 mg / day applied to the skin twice weekly.
 For the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, the minimum dose of Alora that has been studied and shown to be effective is 0.025 mg / day applied to the skin twice weekly.
 In those patients with an intact uterus who are not using concomitant progestin therapy, Alora can be administered on a cyclic schedule (e.g., 3 weeks of therapy followed by 1 week without) for the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms.
 To lower the risk of constipation, alosetron hydrochloride tablets should be started at a dosage of 0.5 mg twice a day.
 They may be restarted at 0.5 mg once a day.
 Patients well controlled on 0.5 mg once or twice a day may be maintained on this regimen.
 If after 4 weeks the dosage is well tolerated but does not adequately control IBS symptoms, then the dosage can be increased to up to 1 mg twice a day.
 Alosetron hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued in patients who have not had adequate control of IBS symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment with 1 mg twice a day.

 The dose for induction of anesthesia in adult patients and in pediatric patients above the age of ten (10) years will vary between 0.2 and 0.6 mg / kg of body weight, and it must be individualized in each case.
 The usual dose for induction in these patients is 0.3 mg / kg, injected over a period of 30 to 60 seconds.
 There are inadequate data to make dosage recommendations for induction of anesthesia in patients below the age of ten (10) years; therefore, such use is not recommended.
 It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations intermittently during therapy.
 Peak concentrations (30 to 90 minutes after injection) above 35 micrograms per mL and trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose) above 10 micrograms per mL should be avoided.
 The recommended dosage for adults, children and older infants (see WARNINGS box) with normal renal function is 15 mg / kg / day divided into 2 or 3 equal doses administered at equally - divided intervals, i.e., 7.5 mg / kg q12h or 5 mg / kg q8h.
 Treatment of patients in the heavier weight classes should not exceed 1.5 gram / day.

 When amikacin is indicated in uncomplicated urinary tract infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily may be used.
 If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage interval in hours for the normal dose can be calculated by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 9, e.g., if the serum creatinine concentration is 2 mg / 100 mL, the recommended single dose (7.5 mg / kg) should be administered every 18 hours.
 When renal function is impaired and it is desirable to administer amikacin at a fixed time interval, dosage must be reduced.
 First, initiate therapy by administering a normal dose, 7.5 mg / kg, as a loading dose.
 The solution for intravenous use is prepared by adding the contents of a 500 mg vial to 100 or 200 mL of sterile diluent such as 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection or any of the compatible solutions listed below.

 The total daily dose by all routes of administration should not exceed 15 mg / kg / day.
 When amikacin is indicated in uncomplicated urinary tract infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily may be used.
 Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals: If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient's condition is stable, a dosage interval in hours for the normal dose can be calculated by multiplying the patient's serum creatinine by 9, e.g., if the serum creatinine concentration is 2 mg / 100 mL, the recommended single dose (7.5mg / kg) should be administered every 18 hours.
 Reduced Dosage at Fixed Time Intervals: When renal function is impaired and it is desirable to administer amikacin at a fixed time interval, dosage must be reduced.

 Amiloride HCl, one 5 mg tablet daily, should be added to the usual antihypertensive or diuretic dosage of a kaliuretic diuretic.
 The dosage may be increased to 10 mg per day, if necessary.
 More than two 5 mg tablets of amiloride HCl daily usually are not needed, and there is little controlled experience with such doses.
 If persistent hypokalemia is documented with 10 mg, the dose can be increased to 15 mg, then 20 mg, with careful monitoring of electrolytes.
 If it is necessary to use amiloride HCl alone (see INDICATIONS), the starting dosage should be one 5 mg tablet daily.
 This dosage may be increased to 10 mg per day, if necessary.
 More than two 5 mg tablets usually are not needed, and there is little controlled experience with such doses.
 If persistent hypokalemia is documented with 10 mg, the dose can be increased to 15 mg, then 20 mg, with careful monitoring of electrolytes.
 Clearance measurements using single injection techniques are generally inaccurate, particularly in the measurement of ERPF.
 To measure ERPF, the concentration of PAH in the plasma should be maintained at 2 mg per 100 mL, which can be achieved with a priming dose of 6 to 10 mg / kg and an infusion dose of 10 to 24 mg / min.
 Concentrations from 40 to 60 mg per 100 mL are usually necessary.
 Example: UPAH = 8.0 mg / mL
 V = 1.5 mL / min
 PPAH = 0.02 mg / mL
 ERPF = 8.0 x 1.5 / 0.02 = 600 mL / min
 men 675 ± 150 mL / min women 595 ± 125 mL / min
 UPAH = 9.55 mg / mL V = 16.68 mL / min GFR = 120 mL / min PPAH = 0.60 mg / mL Then TmPAH = 9.55 x 16.68 – (120 x 0.60 x 0.83) = 100 mg / min.

 For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1 to 1.5 g / kg / day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism.
 If desired, only one - half of an estimated daily amino acid requirement of 1.5 g / kg can be given on the first day.
 However, if a patient is unable to take oral nourishment for a prolonged period of time, institution of total parenteral nutrition with exogenous calories should be considered.
 Admixtures of 3.5 to 4.25% amino acids with 5 to 10% glucose may be coinfused with a fat emulsion by peripheral vein to provide approximately 1400 to 2000 kcal / day.
 Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be started with 10% dextrose added to the calculated daily requirement of amino acids (1.5 g / kg for a metabolically stable patient).
 Each gram of dextrose provides approximately 3.4 kcal.
 Each gram of fat provides 9 kcal.
 The average depleted major surgical patient with complications requires between 2500 and 4000 kcal and between 12 and 24 grams of nitrogen per day.
 An adult patient in an acceptable weight range with restricted activity who is not hypermetabolic, requires about 30 kcal / kg of body weight / day.
 Average daily adult fluid requirements are between 2500 and 3000 mL and may be much higher with losses from fistula drainage or in severe burns.

 Within 24 to 48 hours the volume and concentration of the solution can be increased until the full strength pediatric solution (amino acids and dextrose) is given at a rate of 125 to 150 mL / kg / day.
 A basic solution for pediatric use should contain 25 grams of amino acids and 200 to 250 grams of glucose per 1000 mL, administered from bottles containing 250 or 500 mL.
 Such a solution given at the rate of 145 mL / kg / day provides 130 kcal / kg / day.
 While Recommended Dietary Allowances for oral protein are approximately 0.8 g / kg of body weight for the healthy adult, protein and caloric requirements in traumatized or maInourished patients may be substantially increased.
 To satisfy protein needs and promote positive nitrogen balance, the daily dosage level of amino acids for adult patients with adequate caloric intake is approximately 1.5 g / kg of body weight.
 Approximately 60 to 180 mEq of potassium, 10 to 30 mEq of magnesium, and 10 to 40 mM of phosphate / day appear necessary to achieve optimum metabolic response.
 A mixture containing 500 mL of Aminosyn - HBC 7% with 500 mL of concentrated dextrose supplemented with electrolytes, trace metals and vitamins may be administered over a period of approximately 8 hours.
 The recommended dosage is 80 to 120 g of amino acids (12 to 18 g of nitrogen) as Aminosyn - HF 8% per day.
 Typically, 500 mL of Aminosyn - HF 8% appropriately mixed with 500 mL of 50% dextrose supplemented with electrolytes and vitamins is administered over an 8 to 12 hour period.
 Patients with fluid restrictions may only tolerate 1 to 2 liters.
 Approximately 60 to 180 mEq of potassium, 10 to 30 mEq of magnesium, and 10 to 40 mMol of phosphorus per day appear necessary to achieve optimum metabolic response.

 Such infusates can be prepared by dilutions of Aminosyn - HF 8% with Sterile Water for Injection, USP or 5% to 10% dextrose to prepare isotonic or slightly hypertonic solutions for peripheral infusion.
 Admixtures of 3.5 to 4.25% amino acids with 5 to 10% dextrose may be infused with a fat emulsion by peripheral vein to provide approximately 1400 to 2000 kcal / day.
 Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be started with 10% dextrose added to the calculated daily requirement of amino acids (1.5 g / kg for a metabolically stable patient).
 Each gram of dextrose provides approximately 3.4 kcal.
 Each gram of fat provides 9 kcal.
 The average depleted major surgical patient with complications requires between 2500 and 4000 kcal and between 12 and 24 grams of nitrogen per day.
 An adult patient in an acceptable weight range with restricted activity who is not hypermetabolic, requires about 30 kcal / kg of body weight / day.

 The usual dose of phosphorus added to a liter of TPN solution (containing 25% dextrose) is 12 mM.
 Typically, the 8.5% solution is used in equal volume with 50% or 70% dextrose to provide an admixture containing 4.25% amino acids and 25% or 35% dextrose respectively.
 For most pediatric patients on intravenous nutrition, 2.5 grams amino acids / kg / day with dextrose alone or with I.V.
 lipid calories of 100 to 130 kcal / kg / day is recommended.
 It is acceptable in pediatrics to start with a nutritional solution of half strength at a rate of about 60 to 70 mL / kg / day.
 Within 24 to 48 hours the volume and concentration of the solution can be increased until the full strength pediatric solution (amino acids and dextrose) is given at a rate of 125 to 150 mL / kg / day.
 A basic solution for pediatric use should contain 25 grams of amino acids and 200 to 250 grams of glucose per 1000 mL, administered from containers containing 250 or 500 mL.
 Such a solution given at the rate of 145 mL / kg / day provides 130 kcal / kg / day.
 For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1 to 1.5 g / kg / day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism.
 Aminosyn II 3.5% in 5% Dextrose (amino acid injection in dextrose injection) infused at a rate of 45 mL / kg / day, will meet the fluid and amino acid requirements of the stable adult patient.
 The daily requirements of the stable, nonhypermetabolic adult patient in an acceptable weight range with restricted physical activity are approximately 30 kcal / kg of body weight, 1 to 1.5 g amino acid / kg, and 2500 to 3000 mL of fluids.

 Adding 20 mL of TPN Electrolytes (List 5779) to the amino acid chamber and 5 mL of Potassium Phosphate (List 7296) to the dextrose chamber will result in final admixture concentrations (in mEq / L) as follows: 57.2 sodium, 42 potassium, 35 chloride, 5 magnesium, 4.5 calcium, 65.4 acetate, and 15 (mM) phosphate.
 The usual dose of phosphate added to a liter of TPN solution (containing 25% dextrose) is 12 to 15 mM.
 A 5% amino acid solution is too concentrated for use in pediatric patients less than one year old, who generally receive a 2 to 2.5% amino acid solution.
 Dosage is usually prescribed on a g / kg body weight / day basis and patient age as follows: infants, 2 to 3 g / kg / day; ages 1 to 3 years, 2 to 2.5 g / kg / day; ages 4 to 12 years, 2 g / kg / day; ages 13 to 15 years, 1.7 g / kg / day; ages 16 and above, 1.5 g / kg / day.
 Energy requirements for children between 1 and 7 years of age are approximately 75 to 90 kcal / kg / day; for children 7 to 12 years of age, 60 to 75 kcal / kg / day; and for ages 12 to 18 years, 30 to 60 kcal / kg / day.
 The high solution osmolarity (894 mOsmol / L) will likely provoke vein irritation if the solution is administered without fat emulsion.
 The daily nutrient requirements of an average adult patient, not hypermetabolic, in an acceptable weight range and with restricted physical activity, are about 30 kcal / kg of body weight, 12 to 18 grams of nitrogen (or 1.0 to 1.5 g amino acid / kg / day) and between 2500 and 3000 mL of fluids.
 In such cases, 4000 calories and 25 grams of nitrogen or more may be required daily to achieve nitrogen balance.
 The maximum rate at which dextrose can be infused without producing glycosuria is 0.5 g / kg / hour; at a rate of 0.8 g / kg / hour, about 95% of the infused dextrose is retained.
 Adding 20 mL of TPN Electrolytes (multiple electrolyte additive, List 5779) to each 500 mL of the amino acid solution and 4 to 5 mL of Potassium Phosphate (List 7296) to each 500 mL of 40 to 50% dextrose solution will result in final admixture concentrations appropriate for central vein administration.
 The usual dose of phosphate added to a liter of TPN solution (containing 25% dextrose) is 12 to 15 mM.
 Dosage of amino acids is usually prescribed on a g / kg body weight / day basis, with adjustments for patient age as follows: ages 1 to 3 years, 2 to 2.5 g / kg / day; ages 4 to 12 years, 2 g / kg / day; ages 13 to 15 years, 1.7 g / kg / day; ages 16 and above, 1.5 g / kg / day.
 Energy requirements for children between 1 and 7 years of age are approximately 75 to 90 kcal / kg / day; for children 7 to 12 years of age, 60 to 75 kcal / kg / day; and for ages 12 to 18 years, 30 to 60 kcal / kg / day.
 Each 100 mL of Aminosyn II contains:
 Aminosyn II in the 2000 mL flexible Pharmacy Bulk Package is designed for use with manual, gravity flow operations and automated gravimetric compounding devices for preparing intravenous nutritional admixtures.
 A mixture of Aminosyn II and dextrose diluted to a final concentration of 5% to 10% amino acids and 5% to 10% dextrose is suitable for administration by peripheral vein.
 For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1.0 to 1.5 g / kg / day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism.
 If desired, only one - half of an estimated daily amino acid requirement of 1.5 g / kg can be given on the first day.
 However, if a patient is unable to take oral nourishment for a prolonged period of time, institution of total parenteral nutrition with exogenous calories should be considered.
 Solutions containing 3.5 to 5% amino acids with 5 to 10% glucose may be infused with a fat emulsion by peripheral vein to provide approximately 1400 to 2000 kcal / day.
 Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be started with 10% dextrose added to the calculated daily requirement of amino acids (1.5 g / kg for a metabolically stable patient).
 Each gram of dextrose provides approximately 3.4 kcal.
 Each gram of fat provides 9 kcal.
 The average depleted major surgical patient with complications requires between 2500 and 4000 kcal and between 12 and 24 grams of nitrogen per day.
 An adult patient in an acceptable weight range with restricted activity who is not hypermetabolic, requires about 30 kcal / kg of body weight / day.
 Average daily adult fluid requirements are between 2500 and 3000 mL and may be much higher with losses from fistula drainage or severe burns.
 Typically, a hospitalized patient may lose 12 to 18 grams of nitrogen a day, and in severe trauma the daily loss may be 20 to 25 grams or more.
 Typically, each liter of central vein TPN solution for adults contains 42.5 to 50 g of Aminosyn II with approximately 250 ± 100 g of dextrose; supplementary nonprotein calories from intravenous fat emulsion may be prescribed, at the discretion of the physician.
 For most pediatric patients on intravenous nutrition, 2.5 grams amino acids / kg / day with dextrose alone or with I.V.
 lipid calories of 100 to 130 kcal / kg / day is recommended.
 It is acceptable in pediatrics to start with a nutritional solution of half strength at a rate of about 60 to 70 mL / kg / day.
 Within 24 to 48 hours the volume and concentration of the solution can be increased until the full strength pediatric solution (amino acids and dextrose) is given at a rate of 125 to 150 mL / kg / day.
 A basic solution for pediatric use should contain 25 grams of amino acids and 200 to 250 grams of glucose per 1000 mL, administered from containers containing 250 or 500 mL.
 Such a solution given at the rate of 145 mL / kg / day provides 130 kcal / kg / day.
 The recommended intravenous dose of Aminosyn - PF 10% is up to 2.5 g amino acid / kg / day for infants up to 10 kg.
 For infants and children larger than 10 kg, the total daily dose of amino acids should be up to 25 g amino acids / day for the first 10 kg of body weight plus 1.0 to 1.25 g amino acid for each kg of body weight over 10 kg.
 Initial amino acid dosage levels of 1.0 g / kg / day may be increased gradually in increments of 0.5 g / kg / day to approximate desired intake levels.
 Nonprotein calories should constitute approximately 100 to 130 kcal / kg / day.
 Part of the nonprotein caloric requirement may be provided as lipid emulsion administered concurrently to provide up to 60% of daily calories at a dose not to exceed 4 g fat / kg / day.
 Fluid intake for the infant receiving central venous TPN should be approximately 125 mL / kg / day (range: 100 to 175 mL / kg / day), depending on the clinical condition of the patient.
 The suggested intravenous dosage level for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is 500 mg (10 mL) for every 12.5 g (125 mL) of Aminosyn - PF 10% administered (see package insert for Cysteine Hydrochloride Injection, USP).
 The concentration of dextrose in the final admixture is 5 to 10%, and simultaneous administration of lipid emulsion is recommended both as a calorie source and to attenuate the potentially irritating effects of the hypertonic nutritional admixture.
 Fat emulsion may comprise up to 60% of the daily caloric intake at a dosage level not to exceed 4 g fat / kg / day.
 The recommended intravenous dose of Aminosyn - PF 7%, Sulfite - Free, (an amino acid injection — pediatric formula) is up to 2.5 g amino acid / kg / day for infants up to 10 kg.
 For infants and children larger than 10 kg, the total daily dose of amino acids should be up to 25 g amino acids / day for the first 10 kg of body weight plus 1 to 1.25 g amino acid for each kg of body weight over 10 kg.

 The concentration of dextrose in the final admixture is 5 to 10%, and simultaneous administration of lipid emulsion is recommended both as a calorie source and to attenuate the potentially irritating effects of the hypertonic nutritional admixture.
 Fat emulsion may comprise up to 60% of the daily caloric intake at a dosage level not to exceed 4 g fat / kg / day.
 A dosage of 2.4 to 4.7 grams of nitrogen per day (from essential amino acids) with adequate calories will maintain nitrogen equilibrium in patients with uremia.
 The usual daily dose ranges from 300 to 600 mL of Aminosyn - RF 5.2%, Sulfite - Free, (an amino acid injection — renal formula) equivalent to 2.4 to 4.7 grams of nitrogen in 15.7 to 31 grams of essential amino acids.
 Each 500 mL of Aminosyn - RF 5.2% mixed under sterile conditions with 832 mL of Dextrose 70% will provide a solution of 1.95% of Aminosyn - RF 5.2% in 44% dextrose.
 A dosage of 0.5 to 1 gram of essential amino acids per kilogram of body weight per day will meet the requirements of the majority of pediatric patients.
 Initial infusion rates should be slow, generally 20 to 30 mL / hour for the first 6 to 8 hours.
 Aminosyn 7%, 8.5% or 10% may be diluted with sterile water for injection or 5 to 10% Dextrose Injection to achieve a final amino acid concentration of 3.5, 4.25 or 5% for peripheral administration.
 For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1.0 to 1.5 g / kg / day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism.
 If desired, only one - half of an estimated daily amino acid requirement of 1.5 g / kg can be given on the first day.
 However, if a patient is unable to take oral nourishment for a prolonged period of time, institution of total parenteral nutrition with exogenous calories should be considered.
 Solutions containing 3.5 to 5% amino acids with 5 to 10% glucose may be coinfused with a fat emulsion by peripheral vein to provide approximately 1400 to 2000 kcal / day.
 Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be started with 10% dextrose added to the calculated daily requirement of amino acids (1.5 g / kg for a metabolically stable patient).
 Each gram of dextrose provides approximately 3.4 kcal.
 Each gram of fat provides 9 kcal.
 The average depleted major surgical patient with complications requires between 2500 and 4000 kcal and between 12 and 24 grams of nitrogen per day.
 An adult patient in an acceptable weight range with restricted activity who is not hypermetabolic, requires about 30 kcal / kg of body weight / day.
 Average daily adult fluid requirements are between 2500 and 3000 mL and may be much higher with losses from fistula drainage or severe burns.
 Typically, a hospitalized patient may lose 12 to 18 grams of nitrogen a day, and in severe trauma the daily loss may be 20 to 25 grams or more.
 The usual dose of phosphate added to a liter of TPN solution (containing 25% dextrose) is 12 mM.
 For most pediatric patients on intravenous nutrition, 2.5 grams amino acids / kg / day with dextrose alone or with I.V.
 lipid calories of 100 to 130 kcal / kg / day is recommended.
 It is acceptable in pediatrics to start with a nutritional solution of half strength at a rate of about 60 to 70 mL / kg / day.
 Within 24 to 48 hours the volume and concentration of the solution can be increased until the full strength pediatric solution (amino acids and dextrose) is given at a rate of 125 to 150 mL / kg / day.
 A basic solution for pediatric use should contain 25 grams of amino acids and 200 to 250 grams of glucose per 1000 mL, administered from bottles containing 250 or 500 mL.
 Such a solution given at the rate of 145 mL / kg / day provides 130 kcal / kg / day.
 The recommended starting dose of intravenous amiodarone is about 1000 mg over the first 24 hours of therapy, delivered by the following infusion regimen:
 After the first 24 hours, the maintenance infusion rate of 0.5 mg / min (720 mg / 24 hours) should be continued utilizing a concentration of 1 to 6 mg / mL (amiodarone HCl injection concentrations greater than 2 mg / mL should be administered via a central venous catheter).
 In the event of breakthrough episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, 150 mg supplemental infusions of amiodarone HCl injection mixed in 100 mL of D5W may be administered.
 The first 24 - hour dose may be individualized for each patient; however, in controlled clinical trials, mean daily doses above 2100 mg were associated with an increased risk of hypotension.
 Amiodarone HCl injection concentrations greater than 3 mg / mL in D5W have been associated with a high incidence of peripheral vein phlebitis; however, concentrations of 2.5 mg / mL or less appear to be less irritating.
 Therefore, for infusions longer than 1 hour, amiodarone HCl injection concentrations should not exceed 2 mg / mL unless a central venous catheter is used (See ADVERSE REACTIONS Postmarketing Reports).
 The recommended dose is 24 mcg twice daily orally with food and water.
 For patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child - Pugh Class B), the recommended starting dose is 16 mcg twice daily.
 For patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child - Pugh Class C), the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg twice daily.
 The recommended dose is 8 mcg twice daily orally with food and water.
 For patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child - Pugh Class C), the recommended starting dose is 8 mcg once daily.
 The recommended dose of AMJEVITA for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is 40 mg administered every other week.
 In the treatment of RA, some patients not taking concomitant MTX may derive additional benefit from increasing the dosing frequency of AMJEVITA to 40 mg every week.
 The recommended AMJEVITA dose regimen for adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD) is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15).
 Two weeks later (Day 29) begin a maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week.
 The recommended AMJEVITA dose regimen for adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15).
 Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every other week.
 The recommended dose of AMJEVITA for adult patients with plaque psoriasis (Ps) is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose.
 Nonproteincalories should be supplied principally as glucose (8 – 10 mg / kg / min) with an intravenous fat emulsion added.
 Attempts should be made to maintain a caloric intake of greater than 80 kcal / kg / day.
 In hyperammonemic infants with suspected, but unconfirmed urea cycle disorders, intravenous arginine should be given (6 mL / kg of Arginine HCl Injection 10%, over 90 minutes followed by the same dose given as a maintenance infusion over 24 hours).
 If deficiencies of ASS or ASL are excluded as diagnostic possibilities, the intravenous dose of arginine HCl should be reduced to 2 mL / kg / day Arginine HCl Injection 10%.
 The recommended dosage range for Amnesteem is 0.5 to 1 mg / kg / day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks.
 In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg / kg / day,8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages.
 Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg / kg / day, as tolerated.
 Effective dosage of amoxapine (amoxapine (amoxapine tablets) tablets) may vary from one patient to another.
 Usual effective dosage is 200 to 300 mg daily.
 Three weeks constitutes an adequate period of trial providing dosage has reached 300 mg daily (or lower level of tolerance) for at least two weeks.
 If no response is seen at 300 mg, dosage may be increased, depending upon tolerance, up to 400 mg daily.
 Hospitalized patients who have been refractory to antidepressant therapy and who have no history of convulsive seizures may have dosage raised cautiously up to 600 mg daily in divided doses.
 Amoxapine (amoxapine (amoxapine tablets) tablets) may be given in a single daily dose, not to exceed 300 mg, preferably at bedtime.
 If the total daily dosage exceeds 300 mg, it should be given in divided doses.
 Usual starting dosage is 50 mg two or three times daily.
 Depending upon tolerance, dosage may be increased to 100 mg two or three times daily by the end of the first week.
 (Initial dosage of 300 mg daily may be given, but notable sedation may occur in some patients during the first few days of therapy at this level.)
 Increases above 300 mg daily should be made only if 300 mg daily has been ineffective during a trial period of at least two weeks.
 When effective dosage is established, the drug may be given in a single dose (not to exceed 300 mg) at bedtime.
 Recommended starting dosage of amoxapine (amoxapine (amoxapine tablets) tablets) is 25 mg two or three times daily.
 If no intolerance is observed, dosage may be increased by the end of the first week to 50 mg two or three times daily.
 Although 100 to 150 mg daily may be adequate for many elderly patients, some may require higher dosage.
 Careful increases up to 300 mg daily are indicated in such cases.
 Once an effective dosage is established, amoxapine (amoxapine (amoxapine tablets) tablets) may conveniently be given in a single bedtime dose, not to exceed 300 mg.
 For maintenance therapy at dosages of 300 mg or less, a single dose at bedtime is recommended.
 Due to incompletely developed renal function affecting elimination of amoxicillin in this age group, the recommended upper dose of AMOXIL is 30 mg / kg / day divided every 12 hours.
 The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXIL, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days.
 The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXIL and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily (every 8 hours) for 14 days.
 150 U will facilitate absorption of 1,000 mL or more of solution.
 Amphadase® may be added to small volumes of solution (up to 200 mL), such as small clysis for infants or solutions of drugs for subcutaneous injection.
 For infants and children less than 3 years old, the volume of a single clysis should be limited to 200 mL; and in premature infants or during the neonatal period, the daily dosage should not exceed 25 mL / kg of body weight; the rate of administration should not be greater than 2 mL per minute.
 The maximum recommended dose of AMPYRA is one 10 mg tablet twice daily, taken with or without food, and should not be exceeded.
 In patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51 – 80 mL / min), AMPYRA plasma levels may approach those seen at a dose of 15 mg twice daily, a dose that may be associated with an increased risk of seizures.
 No additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 10 mg twice daily and adverse reactions and discontinuations because of adverse reactions were more frequent at higher doses [see FDA - Approved PATIENT INFORMATION for complete “Instructions for Use”].
 The recommended adult dose for most patients is one (1) AMRIX 15 mg capsule taken once daily.
 Some patients may require up to 30 mg / day, given as one (1) AMRIX 30 mg capsule taken once daily or as two (2) AMRIX 15 mg capsules taken once daily.
 The maximum recommended dose of Amturnide is 300 / 10 / 25 mg.
 Two to six inhalations of the vapors from the capsule are usually sufficient to promptly produce therapeutic effects.
 The maximum single dose for an adult is 1 g.
 The average intramuscular dose ranges from 65 mg to 0.5 g. A volume of 5 mL (irrespective of concentration) should not be exceeded at any one site because of possible tissue irritation.
 The rate of IV injection for adults should not exceed 50 mg / min to prevent sleep or sudden respiratory depression.
 Ordinarily, an intravenous dose of 65 mg to 0.5 g may be given to a child 6 to 12 years of age.
 The recommended dose for Amyvid is 370 MBq (10 mCi), maximum 50 μg mass dose, administered as a single intravenous bolus in a total volume of 10 mL or less.
 A 10 - minute PET image should be acquired starting 30 to 50 minutes after Amyvid intravenous injection.
 Image reconstruction should include attenuation correction with resulting transaxial pixel sizes between 2 and 3 mm.
 Figures 1, 2, and 3 provide examples of negative and positive scans.
 Figure 1
 Figure 1: Examples of Amyvid negative scans (top two rows) and positive scans (bottom two rows).
 The bottom two arrows indicate areas of decreased gray - white contrast with increased cortical radioactivity that is comparable to the radioactivity in the adjacent white matter.
 Figure 2
 The effective dose resulting from a 370 MBq (10 mCi) dose of Am yvid is 7.0 mSv in an adult, (19 x 370 = 7030 μSv = 7.030 mSv).
 The total radiation exposure from Amyvid administration and subsequent scan on a PET / CT scanner is estimated to be 9 mSv.
 Subcutaneously or intramuscularly - 0.2 to 1 mL (mg).
 For bronchial asthma in pediatric patients, administer 0.01 mg / kg or 0.3 mg / m2 to a maximum of 0.5 mg subcutaneously, repeated every four hours if required.
 For cardiac resuscitation - A dose of 0.5 mL (0.5 mg) diluted to 10 mL with sodium chloride injection can be administered intravenously or intracardially to restore myocardial contrac - tility.
 Ophthalmologic use (for producing conjunctival decongestion, to control hemorrhage, produce mydriasis and reduce intraocular pressure)—Use a concentration of 1:10,000 (0.1 mg / mL) to 1:1,000 (1 mg / mL).
 Intraspinal use (Amp 88) - Usual dose is 0.2 to 0.4 mL (0.2 to 0.4 mg) added to anesthetic spinal fluid mixture (may prolong anesthetic action by limiting absorption).
 For use with local anesthetic—Epinephrine 1:100,000 (0.01 mg / mL) to 1:20,000 (0.05 mg / mL) is the usual concentration employed with local anesthetics.
 The recommended daily dose in children and adults is 1 - 5 mg / kg body weight per day.
 The usual effective dose is 1 - 2 mg / kg / day but higher doses may be required, and the dose should be individualized.
 Treatment with Anafranil should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg daily and gradually increased, as tolerated, to approximately 100 mg during the first 2 weeks.
 Thereafter, the dosage may be increased gradually over the next several weeks, up to a maximum of 250 mg daily.
 As with adults, the starting dose is 25 mg daily and should be gradually increased (also given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects) during the first 2 weeks, as tolerated, up to a daily maximum of 3 mg / kg or 100 mg, whichever is smaller.
 Thereafter, the dosage may be increased gradually over the next several weeks up to a daily maximum of 3 mg / kg or 200 mg, whichever is smaller (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).
 While there are no systematic studies that answer the question of how long to continue Anafranil, OCD is a chronic condition and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with Anafranil is unclear.
 The usual dosage of Ancobon is 50 to 150 mg / kg / day administered in divided doses at 6 - hour intervals.
 The recommended starting dose is one ANDRODERM 4 mg / day system (not two 2 mg / day systems) applied nightly for 24 hours, delivering approximately 4 mg of testosterone per day.
 Serum concentrations outside the range of 400 – 930 ng / dL require increasing the daily dose to 6 mg (i.e., one 4 mg / day and one 2 mg / day system) or decreasing the daily dose to 2 mg (i.e., one 2 mg / day system), maintaining nightly application.
 Patients currently maintained on ANDRODERM 2.5 mg / day, 5 mg / day, and 7.5 mg / day may be switched to the 2 mg / day, 4 mg / day, and 6 mg / day dosage using the following schema:
 The recommended starting dose of AndroGel 1% is 50 mg of testosterone (4 pump actuations, two 25 mg packets, or one 50 mg packet), applied topically once daily in the morning to the shoulders and upper arms and / or abdomen area (preferably at the same time every day).
 If the serum testosterone concentration is below the normal range, the daily AndroGel 1% dose may be increased from 50 mg to 75 mg and from 75 mg to 100 mg for adult males as instructed by the physician (see Table 1, Dosing Information for AndroGel 1%).
 If the serum testosterone concentration consistently exceeds the normal range at a daily dose of 50 mg, AndroGel 1% therapy should be discontinued.
 After the priming procedure, patients should completely depress the pump one time actuation for every 12.5 mg of testosterone required to achieve the daily prescribed dosage.
 The recommended starting dose of AndroGel 1.62% is 40.5 mg of testosterone (2 pump actuations or a single 40.5 mg packet) applied topically once daily in the morning to the shoulders and upper arms.
 The dose can be adjusted between a minimum of 20.25 mg of testosterone (1 pump actuation or a single 20.25 mg packet) and a maximum of 81 mg of testosterone (4 pump actuations or two 40.5 mg packets).
 To ensure proper dosing, the dose should be titrated based on the pre - dose morning serum testosterone concentration from a single blood draw at approximately 14 days and 28 days after starting treatment or following dose adjustment.
 Table 1 describes the dose adjustments required at each titration step.
 After the priming procedure, fully depress the actuator once for every 20.25 mg of AndroGel 1.62%.
 When 40.5 mg packets need to be split between the left and right shoulder, patients may squeeze a portion of the gel from the packet into the palm of the hand and apply to application sites.
 ANDROXY™ (Fluoxymesterone Tablets, USP), for oral administration, may be given as a single daily dose or in divided doses.
 Dosage is within the range of 2.5 to 20 mg daily, although generally in the lower range of 2.5 to 10 mg daily, and for a limited duration, for example 4 to 6 months.
 As replacement therapy, i.e., for eunuchism, a daily dose of 5 to 20 mg is suggested.
 It is usually preferable to start therapy at a higher level within the range (e.g., 10 mg), with subsequent adjustment as required.
 A daily dose of 10 to 40 mg, given in divided doses, is recommended.
 The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg / kg ANECTINE (succinylcholine chloride) Injection given intravenously.
 The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg / kg for adults.
 The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute.
 Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion.
 The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation.
 This IV solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation.
 An IV injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg / kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg / kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required.
 For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the IV dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg / kg for infants and small children; for older children and adolescents the dose is 1 mg / kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).
 A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg / kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route.
 ANECTINE (succinylcholine chloride) Injection is stable for 24 hours after dilution to a final concentration of 1 to 2 mg / mL in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 The dosage is one Angeliq 0.25 mg DRSP / 0.5 mg E2 tablet or one Angeliq 0.5 mg DRSP / 1 mg E2 tablet taken by mouth once daily.
 The dosage is one Angeliq 0.5 mg DRSP / 1 mg E2 tablet taken by mouth once daily.
 Angiomax is intended for use with aspirin (300 - 325 mg daily) and has been studied only in patients receiving concomitant aspirin.
 The recommended dose of Angiomax is an intravenous (IV) bolus dose of 0.75 mg / kg, followed immediately by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the PCI / PTCA procedure.
 Five min after the bolus dose has been administered, an activated clotting time (ACT) should be performed and an additional bolus of 0.3 mg / kg should be given if needed.
 The recommended dose of Angiomax in patients with HIT / HITTS undergoing PCI is an IV bolus of 0.75 mg / kg.
 After four hours, an additional IV infusion of Angiomax may be initiated at a rate of 0.2 mg / kg / h (low - rate infusion), for up to 20 hours, if needed.

 one unit of APIDRA has the same glucose - lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin) when given intravenously.
 The total daily insulin requirement may vary and is usually between 0.5 to 1 Unit / kg / day.
 Injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdomen, thigh or upper arm) from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [See ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 For intravenous use, APIDRA should be used at concentrations of 0.05 Units / mL to 1 Unit / mL insulin glulisine in infusion systems using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags.
 See Table 1 for equivalent daily doses of APLENZIN (bupropion hydrobromide) and bupropion hydrochloride.
 The recommended starting dose for MDD is 174 mg once daily in the morning.

 The recommended starting dose for SAD is 174 mg once daily.
 After 7 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 348 mg once daily in the morning.
 Doses above 300 mg of bupropion HCl extended - release (equivalent to APLENZIN 348 mg) were not assessed in the SAD trials.
 For patients treated with 348 mg per day, decrease the dose to 150 mg once daily before discontinuing APLENZIN.
 When discontinuing treatment in patients treated with APLENZIN 348 mg once daily, decrease the dose to 174 mg once daily prior to discontinuation.
 In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh score: 7 to 15), maximum dose is 174 mg every other day.
 In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh score: 5 to 6), consider reducing dose and / or frequency of dosing [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with APLENZIN is unclear.
 Because of the high incidence of nausea and vomiting with APOKYN treatment, an antiemetic, e.g., trimethobenzamide 300 mg three times a day, should be started 3 days prior to the initial dose of APOKYN [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended starting dose of APOKYN is 0.2 mL (2 mg).
 Titrate on the basis of effectiveness and tolerance, up to a maximum recommended dose of 0.6 mL (6 mg) [see Clinical Studies].
 There is no evidence from controlled trials that doses greater than 0.6 mL (6 mg) gave an increased effect and therefore, individual doses above 0.6 mL (6 mg) are not recommended.
 There is limited experience with single doses greater than 0.6 mL (6 mg), dosing more than 5 times per day and with total daily doses greater than 2 mL (20 mg).
 The initial dose should be a 0.2 mL (2 mg) test dose in a setting where medical personnel can closely monitor blood pressure and pulse.
 Both supine and standing blood pressure and pulse should be checked pre - dose and at 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 60 minutes post - dose (and after 60 minutes, if there is significant hypotension at 60 minutes).
 If the patient tolerates the 0.2 mL (2 mg) dose, and responds adequately, the starting dose should be 0.2 mL (2 mg), used on an as needed basis to treat recurring “off” episodes.
 If needed, the dose can be increased in 0.1 mL (1 mg) increments every few days on an outpatient basis.
 The general principle guiding subsequent dosing (described in detail below) is to determine that the patient needs and can tolerate a higher test dose, 0.3 mL or 0.4 mL (3 mg or 4 mg, respectively) under close medical supervision.
 A trial of outpatient dosing may follow (periodically assessing both efficacy and tolerability), using a dose 0.1 mL (1 mg) lower than the tolerated test dose.
 If the patient tolerates the 0.2 mL (2 mg) test dose but does not respond adequately, a dose of 0.4 mL (4 mg) may be administered under medical supervision, at least 2 hours after the initial test dose, at the next observed “off” period.
 If the patient tolerates and responds to a test dose of 0.4 mL (4 mg), the initial maintenance dose should be 0.3 mL (3 mg) used on an as needed basis to treat recurring “off” episodes as an outpatient.
 If needed, the dose can be increased in 0.1 mL (1 mg) increments every few days on an outpatient basis.
 If the patient does not tolerate a test dose of 0.4 mL (4 mg), a test dose of 0.3 mL (3 mg) may be administered during a separate “off” period under medical supervision, at least 2 hours after the previous dose.
 If the patient tolerates the 0.3 mL (3 mg) test dose, the initial maintenance dose should be 0.2 mL (2 mg) used on an as needed basis to treat existing “off” episodes.
 If needed, and the 0.2 mL (2 mg) dose is tolerated, the dose can be increased to 0.3 mL (3 mg) after a few days.
 In such a patient, the dose should ordinarily not be increased to 0.4 mL (4 mg) on an outpatient basis.
 For patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, the test dose and starting dose should be reduced to 0.1 mL (1 mg) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and Use in Specific Populations].
 Patients who have an interruption in therapy of more than a week should be restarted on a 0.2 mL (2 mg) dose and gradually titrated to effect and tolerability.
 The usual dosage is one hydralazine HCl and hydrochlorothiazide capsule twice daily, the strength depending upon individual requirement following titration.
 Start with 10 mg four times daily for the first 2 - 4 days, increase to 25 mg four times daily for the balance of the first week.
 For the second and subsequent weeks, increase dosage to 50 mg four times daily.
 In a few resistant patients, up to 300 mg of Apresoline (hydralazine) daily may be required for a significant antihypertensive effect.
 The dosage of Apri for the initial cycle of therapy is one rose - colored “active” tablet administered daily from the 1st day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as “Day 1”.
 Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One rose - colored “active” tablet daily for 21 days, then one white “reminder” tablet daily for 7 days.
 After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a rose - colored “active” tablet is taken the next day.
 If the patient starts on Apri postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a rose - colored “active” tablet has been taken daily for 7 days.
 If the patient misses one (1) rose - colored “active” tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the rose - colored “active” tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses two (2) rose - colored “active” tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) rose - colored “active” tablets the day she remembers and two (2) rose - colored “active” tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) rose - colored “active” tablet a day until she finishes the pack.
 If the patient misses two (2) rose - colored “active” tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more rose - colored “active” tablets in a row, the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day.
 If the period begins on Sunday, the first rose - colored “active” tablet is taken on that day.
 Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One rose - colored “active” tablet daily for 21 days, then one white “reminder” tablet daily for 7 days.
 After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a rosecolored “active” tablet is taken the next day (Sunday).
 If the patient starts on Apri postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a rose - colored “active” tablet has been taken daily for 7 days.
 If the patient misses one (1) rose - colored “active” tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the rose - colored “active” tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses two (2) rose - colored “active” tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) rose - colored “active” tablets the day she remembers and two (2) rosecolored “active” tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) rose - colored “active” tablet a day until she finishes the pack.
 If the patient misses two (2) rose - colored “active” tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more rose - colored “active” tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one rose - colored “active” tablet every day until Sunday.
 The recommended dose for maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adult patients is 1.5 g (four APRISO capsules) orally once daily in the morning.
 The recommended starting dose of APTENSIO XR for patients 6 years and above is 10 mg once daily in the morning with or without food.
 The dose may be titrated weekly in increments of 10 mg. Daily doses above 60 mg have not been studied and are not recommended.
 The dose of a single capsule should not be divided.
 The contents of the entire capsule should be taken, and patients should not take anything less than one capsule per day.
 The recommended initial dosage of APTIOM is 400 mg once daily.
 For some patients, treatment may be initiated at 800 mg once daily if the need for seizure reduction outweighs an increased risk of adverse reactions during initiation [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 Dosage should be increased in weekly increments of 400 mg to 600 mg, based on clinical response and tolerability, to a recommended maintenance dosage of 800 mg to 1600 mg once daily.
 For patients on APTIOM monotherapy, the 800 mg once daily maintenance dose should generally be considered in patients who are unable to tolerate a 1200 mg daily dose.
 For patients on APTIOM adjunctive therapy, the 1600 mg daily dose should generally be considered in patients who did not achieve a satisfactory response with a 1200 mg daily dose.
 In patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (i.e., creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min), the initial, titration, and maintenance dosages should generally be reduced by 50%.
 The recommended adult dose of APTIVUS is 500 mg (two 250 mg capsules or 5 mL oral solution) co - administered with 200 mg of ritonavir, twice daily.
 Before prescribing APTIVUS 250 mg capsules, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow capsules.
 The recommended pediatric dose of APTIVUS is 14 mg / kg with 6 mg / kg ritonavir (or 375 mg / m² co - administered with ritonavir 150 mg / m²) taken twice daily not to exceed a maximum dose of APTIVUS 500 mg co - administered with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily.
 For children who develop intolerance or toxicity and cannot continue with APTIVUS 14 mg / kg with 6 mg / kg ritonavir, physicians may consider decreasing the dose to APTIVUS 12 mg / kg with 5 mg / kg ritonavir (or APTIVUS 290 mg / m² co - administered with 115 mg / m² ritonavir) taken twice daily provided their virus is not resistant to multiple protease inhibitors [see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Use in Specific Populations, and Clinical Studies].

 Each 500 mg tablet of ARALEN contains the equivalent of 300 mg chloroquine base.
 Suppression — Adult Dose: 500 mg (= 300 mg base) on exactly the same day of each week.
 Pediatric Dose: The weekly suppressive dosage is 5 mg calculated as base, per kg of body weight, but should not exceed the adult dose regardless of weight.
 However, failing this in adults, an initial double (loading) dose of 1 g (= 600 mg base), or in children 10 mg base / kg may be taken in two divided doses, six hours apart.
 Adults: An initial dose of 1 g (= 600 mg base) followed by an additional 500 mg (= 300 mg base) after six to eight hours and a single dose of 500 mg (= 300 mg base) on each of two consecutive days.
 This represents a total dose of 2.5 g chloroquine phosphate or 1.5 g base in three days.
 First dose: 10 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 600 mg base).
 Second dose: (6 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 300 mg base).
 Third dose: (24 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg.
 Fourth dose: (36 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg.
 Adults, 1 g (600 mg base) daily for two days, followed by 500 mg (300 mg base) daily for at least two to three weeks.
 Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Injection (for prevention of hypotension — see INDICATIONS): The recommended dose is 2 to 10 mg (0.2 to 1mL).
 Intravenous Infusion (for adjunctive treatment of hypotension — see INDICATIONS): The recommended dose is 15 to 100 mg (1.5 to 10 mL) in 500 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection, adjusting the rate of infusion to maintain the blood pressure at the desired level.
 Higher concentrations of ARAMINE (metaraminol) , 150 to 500 mg per 500 mL of infusion fluid, have been used.
 If the patient needs more saline or dextrose solution at a rate of flow that would provide an excessive dose of the vasopressor, the recommended volume of infusion fluid (500 mL) should be increased accordingly.
 ARAMINE (metaraminol) may also be added to less than 500 mL of infusion fluid if a smaller volume is desired.
 In addition to Sodium Chloride Injection and Dextrose Injection 5%, the following infusion solutions were found physically and chemically compatible with Injection ARAMINE when 5 mL of Injection ARAMINE, 10 mg / mL (metaraminol equivalent), was added to 500 mL of infusion solution: Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection Dextran 6% in Saline †, Normosol® - R pH 7.4†, and Normosol® - M in D5 - W† .
 The suggested dose is 0.5 to 5 mg (0.05 to 0.5 mL), followed by an infusion of 15 to 100 mg (1.5 to 10 mL) in 500 mL of infusion fluid as described previously.
 The recommended dosage of ARAVA is 20 mg once daily.
 The maximum recommended daily dosage is 20 mg once per day.
 Consider dosage reduction to 10 mg once daily for patients who are not able to tolerate 20 mg daily (i.e., for patients who experience any adverse events listed in Table 1).

 Argatroban Injection should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose Injection, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection to a final concentration of 1 mg / mL.
 The contents of each 2.5 - mL vial should be diluted 100 - fold by mixing with 250 mL of diluent.
 Use 250 mg (2.5 mL) per 250 mL of diluent or 500 mg (5 mL) per 500 mL of diluent.
 The pH of the intravenous solution prepared as recommended is 3.2 to 7.5.
 Solutions prepared as recommended are stable at controlled room temperature, 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) (see USP) in ambient indoor light for 24 hours; therefore, light - resistant measures such as foil protection for intravenous lines are unnecessary.
 Solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 96 hours when protected from light and stored at controlled room temperature, 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) (see USP), or at refrigerated conditions, 5° ± 3°C (41°± 5°F).
 The recommended initial dose of argatroban for adult patients without hepatic impairment is 2 mcg / kg / min, administered as a continuous infusion (see Table 1).
 Table 1 Recommended Doses and Infusion Rates for 2 mcg / kg / min Dose of Argatroban for Patients With HIT* andWithout Hepatic Impairment (1 mg / mL Final Concentration)
 For use in HIT, therapy with Argatroban Injection is monitored using the aPTT with a target range of 1.5 to 3 times the initial baseline value (not to exceed 100 seconds).
 After the initiation of Argatroban Injection, adjust the dose (not to exceed 10 mcg / kg / min) as necessary to obtain a steady - state aPTT in the target range [see Clinical Studies].
 Initiate an infusion of Argatroban Injection at 25 mcg / kg / min and administer a bolus of 350 mcg / kg via a large bore intravenous line over 3 to 5 minutes (see Table 2).
 Check an activated clotting time (ACT) 5 to 10 minutes after the bolus dose is completed.
 If the ACT is less than 300 seconds, an additional intravenous bolus dose of 150 mcg / kg should be administered, the infusion dose increased to 30 mcg / kg / min, and the ACT checked 5 to 10 minutes later (see Table 2).
 In case of dissection, impending abrupt closure, thrombus formation during the procedure, or inability to achieve or maintain an ACT over 300 seconds, additional bolus doses of 150 mcg / kg may be administered and the infusion dose increased to 40 mcg / kg / min.
 Table 2: Recommended Starting and Maintenance Doses (Within the Target ACT Range) of Argatroban Injection in Patients Undergoing PCI Without Hepatic Impairment (1 mg / mL Final Concentration)
 Table 3: Recommended Dose Adjustments of Argatroban Injection for Patients Outside of ACT Target Range Undergoing PCI Without Hepatic Impairment (1 mg / mL Final Concentration)
 For adult patients with HIT and moderate or severe hepatic impairment (based on Child - Pugh classification), an initial dose of 0.5 mcg / kg / min is recommended, based on the approximately 4 - fold decrease in argatroban clearance relative to those with normal hepatic function.Monitor the aPTT closely, and adjust the dosage as clinically indicated.
 Tests of anticoagulant effects (including the aPTT) typically attain steady - state levels within one to three hours following initiation of argatroban in patients without hepatic impairment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 In this case, in order to predict the INR on warfarin alone, temporarily reduce the dose of Argatroban Injection to a dose of 2 mcg / kg / min.

 ARIDOL is a test kit containing the required capsules of dry powder mannitol for oral inhalation in graduated doses with the supplied single patient use inhaler necessary to perform one bronchial challenge test.
 The airway response to bronchial challenge testing with ARIDOL (mannitol inhalation powder) is measured using forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
 A positive response is achieved when the patient experiences a 15% reduction in FEV1 from (0 mg) baseline (or a 10% incremental reduction in FEV1 between consecutive doses).
 The dose of ARIMIDEX is one 1 mg tablet taken once a day.
 The recommended starting and target dose for aripiprazole is 10 mg / day or 15 mg / day administered on a once - a - day schedule without regard to meals.
 Aripiprazole has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 mg / day to 30 mg / day, when administered as the tablet formulation; however, doses higher than 10 mg / day or 15 mg / day were not more effective than 10 mg / day or 15 mg / day.
 These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either aripiprazole 15 mg / day or placebo, and observed for relapse [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended target dose of aripiprazole is 10 mg / day.
 Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 mg and 30 mg.

 Most patients require 60 to 120 mg / day.
 Failure to respond to doses of 180 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption.
 Maintenance dosages 60 to 120 mg / day usually result in normal serum T4 and T3 levels.
 Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg / mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly.
 This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV.
 Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.
 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone.
 A 50 percent or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid - pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.
 For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg / kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days.
 ARNUITY ELLIPTA should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily by the orally inhaled route.

 There are insufficient data to support a dose recommendation for patients with a CLcr < 50 mL / min.
 As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) in tablet or elixir form may be administered the first day.
 The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily.
 Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.
 The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as little as 1 mg daily.
 It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1 mg dose.
 An ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) dosage of 3 to 6 mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate.
 ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) TABLETS and ELIXIR - The total daily intake of ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) tablets or elixir is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes.
 High doses ( > 10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the fourth at bedtime.
 ARTHROTEC is administered as ARTHROTEC 50 (50 mg diclofenac sodium / 200 mcg misoprostol) or as ARTHROTEC 75 (75 mg diclofenac sodium / 200 mcg misoprostol).
 For rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage is ARTHROTEC 50 three or four times a day.
 The total dose of misoprostol should not exceed 800 mcg / day, and no more than 200 mcg of misoprostol should be administered at any one time.
 Doses of diclofenac higher than 150 mg / day in osteoarthritis or higher than 225 mg / day in rheumatoid arthritis are not recommended.
 A single dose of ARYMO ER greater than 60 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

 The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted.
 ATACAND can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg.
 Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg. Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect.
 Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily.
 Use in moderate to severe Hepatic Impairment: ATACAND HCT is not recommended for initiation because the appropriate starting dose, 8 mg, cannot be given (see Special Populations, Hepatic Insufficiency).
 A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily can expect an incremental effect from ATACAND HCT 16 - 12.5 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from ATACAND HCT 16 - 12.5 mg and serum potassium may improve.
 A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 32 mg of ATACAND can expect incremental blood pressure effects from ATACAND HCT 32 - 12.5 mg and then 32 - 25 mg.
 For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested: in adults, 50 - 100 mg q.i.d.
 ; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses and over 6 years, 50 - 100 mg daily in divided doses.

 If the once - weekly dose is missed, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember and return to taking one tablet once - a - week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.
 Patients should not take two tablets on the same day.
 The initial dose of TENORMIN is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy.
 If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to TENORMIN 100 mg given as one tablet a day.
 Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.
 The initial dose of TENORMIN is 50 mg given as one tablet a day.
 If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to TENORMIN 100 mg given as one tablet a day.
 Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect.
 The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg.
 Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg TENORMIN over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later.
 In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), TENORMIN Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later.
 Thereafter, TENORMIN can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6 - 9 days or until discharge from the hospital.
 Data from other beta blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of IV beta blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication, the IV beta blocker may be eliminated and patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given TENORMIN Tablets 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once a day for at least seven days (if the IV dosing is excluded).
 Although the demonstration of efficacy of TENORMIN is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days, data from other beta blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta blockers that are effective in the postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications.
 Accumulation of atenolol and prolongation of its half - life were studied in subjects with creatinine clearance between 5 and 105 mL / min.
 Some renally - impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of TENORMIN: 25 mg given as one tablet a day.
 If this 25 mg dose is used, assessment of efficacy must be made carefully.
 Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur.
 The recommended dose is 10 to 20 mg / kg daily intravenously for 8 to 14 days.
 To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available.
 The usual range is 2 to 6 mg / day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg / day.
 For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg / day given b.i.d.
 For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime.
 For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg / day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated.
 For the treatment of status epilepticus, the usual recommended dose of ATIVAN Injection is 4 mg given slowly (2 mg / min) for patients 18 years and older.
 If seizures continue or recur after a 10 - to 15 - minute observation period, an additional 4 mg intravenous dose may be slowly administered.
 For the designated indications as a premedicant, the usual recommended dose of lorazepam for intramuscular injection is 0.05 mg / kg up to a maximum of 4 mg. As with all premedicant drugs, the dose should be individualized (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).
 For the primary purpose of sedation and relief of anxiety, the usual recommended initial dose of lorazepam for intravenous injection is 2 mg total, or 0.02 mg / lb (0.044 mg / kg), whichever is smaller.
 In those patients in whom a greater likelihood of lack of recall for perioperative events would be beneficial, larger doses as high as 0.05 mg / kg up to a total of 4 mg may be administered (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).
 The rate of injection should not exceed 2.0 mg per minute.
 Adults: An atracurium besylate dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg / kg (1.7 to 2.2 times the ED95), given as an intravenous bolus injection, is the recommended initial dose for most patients.
 With this dose, good or excellent conditions for nonemergency intubation can be expected in 2 to 2.5 minutes in most patients, with maximum neuromuscular block achieved approximately 3 to 5 minutes after injection.
 Clinically required neuromuscular block generally lasts 20 to 35 minutes under balanced anesthesia.
 The same initial atracurium besylate dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg / kg may be used for intubation prior to administration of these inhalation agents; however, if atracurium is first administered under steady - state of isoflurane or enflurane, the initial atracurium besylate dose should be reduced by approximately one - third, i.e., to 0.25 to 0.35 mg / kg, to adjust for the potentiating effects of these anesthetic agents.
 Atracurium besylate doses of 0.08 to 0.10 mg / kg are recommended for maintenance of neuromuscular block during prolonged surgical procedures.
 Because atracurium lacks cumulative effects, maintenance doses may be administered at relatively regular intervals for each patient, ranging approximately from 15 to 25 minutes under balanced anesthesia, slightly longer under isoflurane or enflurane.
 Higher atracurium doses (up to 0.2 mg / kg) permit maintenance dosing at longer intervals.
 An atracurium besylate dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg is recommended as the initial dose for infants (1 month to 2 years of age) under halothane anesthesia.
 Special Considerations: An initial atracurium besylate dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg, given slowly or in divided doses over one minute, is recommended for adults, children, or infants with significant cardiovascular disease and for adults, children, or infants with any history (e.g., severe ana - phylactoid reactions or asthma) suggesting a greater risk of histamine release.
 An initial atracurium besylate dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg is recommended for adults following the use of succinylcholine for intubation under balanced anesthesia.
 Infusion in the Operating Room (OR): After administration of a recommended initial bolus dose of atracurium besylate injection (0.3 to 0.5 mg / kg), a diluted solution of atracurium besylate can be administered by continuous infusion to adults and pediatric patients aged 2 or more years for maintenance of neuromuscular block during extended surgical procedures.
 Thereafter, a rate of 5 to 9 mcg / kg / min should be adequate to maintain continuous neuromuscular block in the range of 89% to 99% in most pediatric and adult patients under balanced anesthesia.
 Occasional patients may require infusion rates as low as 2 mcg / kg / min or as high as 15 mcg / kg / min.
 In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with induced hypothermia, the rate of infusion of atracurium required to maintain adequate surgical relaxation during hypothermia (25° to 28°C) has been shown to be approximately half the rate required during normothermia.
 Spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block following discontinuation of atracurium infusion may be expected to proceed at a rate comparable to that following administration of a single bolus dose.
 An infusion rate of 11 to 13 mcg / kg / min (range: 4.5 to 29.5) should provide adequate neuromuscular block in adult patients in an ICU.
 The following tables provide guidelines for delivery, in mL / hr (equivalent to microdrops / min when 60 microdrops = 1 mL), of atracurium solutions in concentrations of 0.2 mg / mL (20 mg in 100 mL) or 0.5 mg / mL (50 mg in 100 mL) with an infusion pump or a gravity flow device.

 Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with body weight at least 40 kg (at least 88 lbs)
 The dose of ATRIPLA is one tablet once daily taken orally on an empty stomach.
 Because ATRIPLA is a fixed - dose combination, it should not be prescribed for patients requiring dosage adjustment such as those with moderate or severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL / min).
 When ATRIPLA is administered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg / day of efavirenz is recommended [See DRUG INTERACTIONS, Table 3, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Table 4].
 In moderate to severe poisoning, the administration of more than one AtroPen® (atropine) may be required until atropinization is achieved (flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, dryness of the mouth and nose).
 It is recommended that three (3) AtroPen® (atropine) auto - injectors be available for use in each person at risk for nerve agent or organophosphate insecticide poisoning; one (1) for mild symptoms plus two (2) more for severe symptoms as described below.
 NOTE: Children weighing under 15 lbs (generally younger than 6 months old) should ordinarily not be treated with the AtroPen® auto - injector.
 Atropine doses for these children should be individualized at doses of 0.05 mg / kg.
 One (1) AtroPen® (atropine) is recommended if two or more MILD symptoms of nerve agent (nerve gas) or insecticide exposure appear in situations where exposure is known or suspected.
 Two (2) additional AtroPen® (atropine) injections given in rapid succession are recommended 10 minutes after receiving the first AtroPen® (atropine) injection if the victim develops any of the SEVERE symptoms listed below.
 Adults Initial single doses in adults vary from around 0.5 mg to 1 mg (5 - 10 mL of the 0.1 mg / mL solution) for antisialagogue and other antivagal effects, to 2 to 3 mg (20 - 30 mL of the 0.1 mg / mL solution) as an antidote for organophosporous or muscarinic mushroom poisoning.
 When used as an antidote, the 2 to 3 mg dose should be repeated no less often that every 20 to 30 minutes until signs of poisoning are sufficiently lessened or signs of atropine poisoning (See ADVERSE REACTIONS and OVERDOSAGE) occur.
 When the recurrent use of atropine is essential in patients with coronary atery disease, the total dose should be restricted to 2 to 3 (maximum 0.03 to 0.04 mg / kg) to avoid the detrimental effects of atropine - induced tachycardia on myocardial oxygen demand.
 For patients with bradyasystolic cardiac arrest, a 1 mg dose of atropine is administered inbravenously and is repeated every 3 - 5 minutes if asystole persists.
 Three milligrams (0.04 mg / kg) given I.V.
 The administration of less than 0.5 mg can produce a paradoxical bradycardia because of the central or peripheral parasympathomimatic effects of low dose in adults.
 The recommended adult dose of atropine for endotracheal administration is 1 to 2 mg diluted to a total not to exceed 10 ml of sterile water or normal saline.
 Titration intervals of one or two hours are recommended tin circumstances that are not life - threatening.
 Usage history of initial dose has been in the range of 0.01to 0.03 mg / kg body weight.
 In individuals from three (3) months of age or greater, 1 drop topically to the cul - de - sac of the conjunctiva, forty minutes prior to the intended maximal dilation time.

 A 25 gauge, 5 / 8“ needle is recommended.
 Single Dose Vial - First withdraw the entire volume of diluent into the syringe to be used for reconstitution.
 It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual patient to prevent transmission of hepatitis B and other infectious agents from one person to another.
 These findings support the simultaneous use of all vaccines as recommended.“14
 The recommended dose of AUBAGIO is 7 mg or 14 mg orally once daily.
 The usual adult dose is one 500 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours.
 For more severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one 875 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 500 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours.
 Adults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the 125 mg / 5 mL or 250 mg / 5 mL suspension in place of the 500 - mg tablet.
 Two 250 - mg tablets of AUGMENTIN should not be substituted for one 500 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.
 Since both the 250 - mg and 500 - mg tablets of AUGMENTIN contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (125 mg, as the potassium salt), two 250 - mg tablets are not equivalent to one 500 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.
 The 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250 - mg chewable tablet should not be substituted for each other, as they are not interchangeable.
 The 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250 - mg chewable tablet do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt).
 The 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid, whereas the 250 - mg chewable tablet contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid.
 The recommended dose of AUGMENTIN is 30 mg / kg / day divided every 12 hours, based on the amoxicillin component.
 However, the every 12 hour suspension (200 mg / 5 mL and 400 mg / 5 mL) and chewable tablets (200 mg and 400 mg) contain aspartame and should not be used by phenylketonurics.
 Table 1: Dosing in Patients Aged 12 weeks (3 months ) and Older
 Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations.
 The 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should not be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg,due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN (250 / 125) versus the 250 - mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN (250 / 62.5).
 Renal impairment patients with a glomerular filtration rate of <30 mL / min should not receive the 875 mg dose.
 Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL / min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection.
 Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL / min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection.
 Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours,depending on severity of the infection.
 Neonates and infants aged < 12 weeks (3 months): Due to incompletely developed renal function affecting elimination of amoxicillin in this age group, the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN is 30 mg / kg / day divided q12h, based on the amoxicillin component.
 Pediatric Patients Weighing 40 kg and More: Should be dosed according to the following adult recommendations: The usual adult dose is one 500 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours.
 For more severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one 875 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 500 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours.
 Among adults treated with 875 mg every 12 hours, significantly fewer experienced severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea versus adults treated with 500 mg every 8 hours.
 Adults: Adults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the 125 mg / 5 mL or 250 mg / 5 mL suspension in place of the 500 - mg tablet.
 See dosage recommendations above for children weighing 40 kg or more.
 The 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250 - mg chewable tablet do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt).
 The 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid, whereas the 250 - mg chewable tablet contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid.
 Due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN (250 / 125) versus the 250 - mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN (250 / 62.5), the 250 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should not be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg and more.
 AUGMENTIN 125 mg / 5 mL Suspension
 Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 125 mg amoxicillin and 31.25 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.
 AUGMENTIN 200 mg / 5 mL Suspension
 Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 200 mg amoxicillin and 28.5 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.
 AUGMENTIN 250 mg / 5 mL Suspension
 Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 250 mg amoxicillin and 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.
 AUGMENTIN 400 mg / 5 mL Suspension
 Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 400 mg amoxicillin and 57.0 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.
 AUGMENTIN ES - 600, 600 mg / 5 mL, does not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt) as any of the other suspensions of AUGMENTIN.
 AUGMENTIN ES - 600 contains 42.9 mg of clavulanic acid per 5 mL, whereas the 200 mg / 5 mL suspension of AUGMENTIN contains 28.5 mg of clavulanic acid per 5 mL and the 400 mg / 5 mL suspension contains 57 mg of clavulanic acid per 5 mL.
 Therefore, the 200 mg / 5 mL and 400 mg / 5 mL suspensions of AUGMENTIN should not be substituted for AUGMENTIN ES - 600, as they are not interchangeable.
 Pediatric patients 3 months and older: Based on the amoxicillin component (600 mg / 5 mL), the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN ES - 600 is 90 mg / kg / day divided every 12 hours, administered for 10 days (see chart below).
 Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg and more: Experience with AUGMENTIN ES - 600 (600 mg / 5 mL formulation) in this group is not available.
 Adults: Experience with AUGMENTIN ES - 600 (600 mg / 5 mL formulation) in adults is not available and adults who have difficulty swallowing should not be given AUGMENTIN ES - 600 (600 mg / 5 mL) in place of the 500 - mg or 875 - mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.
 AUGMENTIN ES - 600 (600 mg / 5 mL Suspension)
 Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 600 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate and 42.9 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.
 Information for the Pharmacist: For patients who wish to alter the taste of AUGMENTIN ES - 600, immediately after reconstitution 1 drop of FLAVORx™ (apple, banana cream, bubble gum, cherry, or watermelon flavor) may be added for every 5 mL of AUGMENTIN ES - 600.
 The recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is 4,000 mg / 250 mg daily according to the following table:
 Tablets of AUGMENTIN (250 mg or 500 mg) CANNOT be used to provide the same dosages as AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets.
 This is because AUGMENTIN XR contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid, while the AUGMENTIN 250 - mg and 500 - mg tablets each contain 125 mg of clavulanic acid.
 Thus, two AUGMENTIN 500 - mg tablets are not equivalent to one AUGMENTIN XR tablet.
 The scored tablet is not intended to reduce the dosage of medication taken; as stated in the table above, the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is two tablets twice a day (every 12 hours).
 Pediatric patients who weigh 40 kg or more and can swallow tablets should receive the adult dose [see Use in Specific Populations].
 The recommended starting dose is 2 tablets orally 3 times per day with meals.
 Serum phosphorus levels should be monitored and the dose of Auryxia titrated in decrements or increments of 1 to 2 tablets per day as needed to maintain serum phosphorus at target levels, up to a maximum dose of 12 tablets daily.
 In a clinical trial conducted in the United States, patients required an average of 8 to 9 tablets a day to control serum phosphorus levels.
 One Hyland Factor VIII Correctional Unit is that quantity of activated prothrombin complex which, upon addition to an equal volume of Factor VIII deficient or inhibitor plasma, will correct the clotting time (ellagic acid - activated partial thromboplastin time) to 35 seconds (normal).
 The recommended dosage range is 25 to 100 Hyland Factor VIII Correctional Units per kg of body weight, depending upon the severity of hemorrhage.
 If infusion at this rate is well tolerated the administration rate may be gradually increased to 10 mL / min.
 Selection of the appropriate dosage strength (Auvi - Q 0.3 mg or Auvi - Q 0.15 mg) is determined according to patient body weight.
 Each Auvi - Q contains a single dose of epinephrine for single - use injection.
 Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from Auvi - Q are fixed, consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0.15 mg are deemed necessary.
 More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].

 The maximum dose of AVANDAMET is 8 mg / 2,000 mg per day.
 To switch to AVANDAMET for patients currently treated with metformin, the usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 4 mg rosiglitazone (total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken (see Table 1).
 To switch to AVANDAMET for patients currently treated with rosiglitazone, the usual starting dose of AVANDAMET is 1,000 mg metformin (total daily dose) plus the dose of rosiglitazone already being taken (see Table 1).
 If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose of AVANDAMET may be increased by increments of 4 mg rosiglitazone and / or 500 mg metformin.
 The maximum recommended total daily dose of AVANDAMET is 8 mg rosiglitazone (taken as 4 mg twice daily) and 2,000 mg metformin (taken as 1,000 mg twice daily).
 The recommended starting dose is 4 mg / 1 mg administered once daily with the first meal of the day.
 The glimepiride component may be increased in no more than 2 mg increments.
 To switch to AVANDARYL for adults currently treated with sulfonylurea, it may take 2 weeks to see a reduction in blood glucose and 2 to 3 months to see the full effect of the rosiglitazone component.
 Patients should be observed carefully (1 to 2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half - life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to AVANDARYL due to potential overlapping of drug effect.
 After an increase in the dosage of the rosiglitazone component, dose titration of AVANDARYL is recommended if patients are not adequately controlled after 2 to 3 months.
 The maximum recommended daily dose is 8 mg rosiglitazone and 4 mg glimepiride.
 AVANDIA may be administered at a starting dose of 4 mg either as a single daily dose or in 2 divided doses.
 For patients who respond inadequately following 8 to 12 weeks of treatment, as determined by reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), the dose may be increased to 8 mg daily.
 The total daily dose of AVANDIA should not exceed 8 mg.
 The recommended initial dose of AVAPRO is 150 mg once daily.

 One orange tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days.
 If Aviane (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) ™ – 28 tablets are started later than day one of the first menstrual cycle or postpartum, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Aviane (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) ™ – 28 tablets until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.
 When the patient is switching from a 28 - day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Aviane (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) ™ on the day after her last tablet.
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two orange tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled orange tablets are missed.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken before the medication is resumed.

 The recommended starting dose of AXIRON (testosterone) topical solution is 60 mg of testosterone (2 pump actuations) applied once daily.
 To ensure proper dosing, serum testosterone concentrations should be measured after initiation of therapy to ensure that the desired concentrations (300 ng / dL - 1050 ng / dL) are achieved.
 If the measured serum testosterone concentration is below 300 ng / dL, the daily testosterone dose may be increased from 60 mg (2 pump actuations) to 90 mg (3 pump actuations) or from 90 mg to 120 mg (4 pump actuations).
 If the serum testosterone concentration exceeds 1050 ng / dL, the daily testosterone dose should be decreased from 60 mg (2 pump actuations) to 30 mg (1 pump actuation) as instructed by a physician.
 If the serum testosterone concentration consistently exceeds 1050 ng / dL at the lowest daily dose of 30 mg (1 pump actuation), AXIRON therapy should be discontinued.
 After priming, patients should completely depress the pump one time (one pump actuation) to dispense 30 mg of testosterone.
 The cup should be filled with no more than 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone.
 Dosing that requires greater than one pump actuation must be applied in increments of 30 mg as is shown in Table 1.
 The process is then repeated with application of 30 mg of testosterone (1 pump actuation) to the other axilla to achieve a total of 60 mg of testosterone applied.
 For patients prescribed the 90 mg dose of testosterone, the procedure is the same, but three applications are required.
 To dose 120 mg of testosterone, four applications are required alternating left and right for each application as shown in Table 1.
 Patients should start with a graduated dosing regimen for 7 days, or as directed by the supervising healthcare provider, before taking one full packet (40 grams) per day (see “PATIENT INFORMATION” for graduated dosing instructions).
 Axona should be added to 4 to 8 ounces (118 to 236 milliliters) of water or other liquids as preferred, and shaken or blended until fully mixed.
 The recommended dose is 370 MBq (10 mCi) administered as an intravenous bolus injection.
 Typical total scan time is between 20 to 30 minutes.
 The (radiation absorbed) effective dose resulting from the administration of the recommended activity of 370 MBq of Axumin is 8 mSv.
 For an administered activity of 370 MBq (10 mCi), the highestmagnitude radiation doses are delivered to the pancreas, cardiac wall, and uterine wall: 38 mGy, 19 mGy, and 17 mGy, respectively.
 2.5 to 10 mg AYGESTIN may be given daily for 5 to 10 days to produce secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen.
 Initial daily dosage of 5 mg AYGESTIN for two weeks.
 Dosage should be increased by 2.5 mg per day every two weeks until 15 mg per day of AYGESTIN is reached.
 To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Ayuna™ (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 0.15 mg / 0.03 mg) must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.
 The dosage of Ayuna™ is one orange tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one green inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to prescribed schedule.
 One orange tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one green inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself by using another method of birth control until she has taken a orange tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 When the patient is switching from a 28 - day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Ayuna™ on the day after her last tablet.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken before the medication is resumed.
 Any time the patient misses two or more orange tablets, she should also use another method of contraception until she has taken a orange tablet daily for seven consecutive days.
 If the patient misses one or more green tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking orange tablets again on the proper day.
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two orange tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled orange tablets are missed.
 Because of the serious nature of infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, dosage of 2 g every six or eight hours is recommended, at least upon initiation of therapy, in systemic infections caused by this organism.
 The intravenous route is recommended for patients requiring single doses greater than 1 g or those with bacterial septicemia, localized parenchymal abscess (eg, intra - abdominal abscess), peritonitis, or other severe systemic or life - threatening infections.
 Therefore, the dosage of AZACTAM should be halved in patients with estimated creatinine clearances between 10 and 30 mL / min / 1.73 m² after an initial loading dose of 1 or 2 g.
 In patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 10 mL / min / 1.73 m²), such as those supported by hemodialysis, the usual dose of 500 mg, 1 g, or 2 g should be given initially.
 Constituted solutions are not for multiple - dose use; should the entire volume in the container not be used for a single dose, the unused solution must be discarded.
 Ampicillin sodium admixtures with aztreonam in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 0.9% are stable for 24 hours at room temperature and 48 hours under refrigeration; stability in Dextrose Injection, USP 5% is 2 hours at room temperature and 8 hours under refrigeration.
 For Bolus Injection: The contents of an AZACTAM 15 mL capacity vial should be constituted with 6 to 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP.
 For Infusion: If the contents of a 15 mL capacity vial are to be transferred to an appropriate infusion solution, each gram of aztreonam should be initially constituted with at least 3 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP.
 Further dilution may be obtained with one of the following intravenous infusion solutions:
 The contents of an AZACTAM 15 mL capacity vial should be constituted with at least 3 mL of an appropriate diluent per gram aztreonam.
 The dose should be slowly injected directly into a vein, or the tubing of a suitable administration set, over a period of 3 to 5 minutes (see next paragraph regarding flushing of tubing).
 AZASAN® (azathioprine) should be administered with caution to patients having one non - functional allele (heterozygous) who are at risk for reduced TPMT activity that may lead to toxicity if conventional doses are given.
 The initial dose is usually 3 to 5 mg / kg daily, beginning at the time of transplant.
 AZASAN® (azathioprine) is usually given as a single daily dose on the day of, and in a minority of cases 1 to 3 days before, transplantation.
 Dose reduction to maintenance levels of 1 to 3 mg / kg daily is usually possible.
 The initial dose should be approximately 1.0 mg / kg (50 to 100 mg) given as a single dose or on a twice daily schedule.
 Dose increments should be 0.5 mg / kg daily, up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg / kg / day.
 Maintenance therapy should be at the lowest effective dose, and the dose given can be lowered decrementally with changes of 0.5 mg / kg or approximately 25 mg daily every 4 weeks while other therapy is kept constant.
 Instill 1 drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily, eight to twelve hours apart for the first two days and then instill 1 drop in the affected eye(s) once daily for the next five days.

 The screening trial employs Baclofen Injection (Intrathecal) at a concentration of 50 mcg / mL.
 A 1 mL ampule (50 mcg / mL) is available for use in the screening trial.
 An initial bolus containing 50 micrograms in a volume of 1 milliliter is administered into the intrathecal space by barbotage over a period of not less than one minute.
 The second screening bolus dose consists of 75 micrograms in 1.5 milliliters.
 If the response is still inadequate, a final bolus screening dose of 100 micrograms in 2 milliliters may be administered 24 hours later.
 The starting screening dose for pediatric patients is the same as in adult patients, i.e., 50 mcg.
 However, for very small patients, a screening dose of 25 mcg may be tried first.
 Patients who do not res pond to a 100 mcg intrathecal bolus should not be considered candidates for an implanted pump for chronic infusion.
 After the first 24 hours, the daily dose should be increased slowly by 5 to 15% only once every 24 hours, until the desired clinical effect is achieved.
 After the first 24 hours, the daily dose should be increased slowly by 5 to 15% only once every 24 hours, until the desired clinical effect is achieved.
 During periodic refills of the pump, the daily dose may be increased by 10 to 40%, but no more than 40%, to maintain adequate symptom control.
 The daily dose may be reduced by 10 to 20% if patients experience side effects.
 Maintenance dosage for long term continuous infusion of Baclofen Injection (Intrathecal) has ranged from 12 mcg / day to 2003 mcg / day, with most patients adequately maintained on 300 micrograms to 800 micrograms per day.
 There is limited experience with daily doses greater than 1000 mcg / day.

 In clinical trials, only 3 of 150 patients required daily doses greater than 1000 mcg / day.
 Average daily dose for patients under 12 years was 274 mcg / day, with a range of 24 to 1199 mcg / day.
 There is not sufficient experience to make firm recommendations for tolerance treatment; however, this “tolerance” has been treated on occasion, in hospital, by a “drug holiday” consisting of the gradual reduction of Baclofen Injection (Intrathecal) over a 2 to 4 week period and switching to alternative methods of spasticity management.
 Use the 1 mL screening ampule only (50 mcg / mL) for bolus injection into the subarachnoid space.
 For a 50 mcg bolus dose, use 1 mL of the screening ampule.
 Use 1.5 mL of 50 mcg / mL baclofen injection for a 75 mcg bolus dose.
 For the maximum screening dose of 100 mcg, use 2 mL of 50 mcg / mL baclofen injection (2 screening ampules).
 For patients who require concentrations other than 500 mcg / mL or 2000 mcg / mL, Baclofen Injection (Intrathecal) must be diluted.
 The maximum recommended daily dose is 60 mL (960 mg trimethoprim) per day.

 BayGam (immune globulin) in a dose of 0.01 mL / lb (0.02 mL / kg) is recommended for household and institutional hepatitis A case contacts.
 BayGam (immune globulin) should be given in a dose of 0.11 mL / lb (0.25 mL / kg) to prevent or modify measles in a susceptible person exposed fewer than 6 days previously.7 A susceptible child who is exposed to measles and who is immunocompromised should receive a dose of 0.5 mL / kg (maximum dose, 15 mL) of BayGam (immune globulin) immediately.8
 If Varicella - Zoster Immune Globulin (Human) is unavailable, BayGam (immune globulin) at a dose of 0.6 to 1.2 mL / kg, promptly given, may also modify varicella.5
 Some studies suggest that the use of BayGam (immune globulin) in exposed, susceptible women can lessen the likelihood of infection and fetal damage; therefore, BayGam (immune globulin) at a dose of 0.55 mL / kg may benefit those women who will not consider a therapeutic abortion.4
 The recommended dosage is 0.66 mL / kg (at least 100 mg / kg) given every 3 to 4 weeks.6 A double dose is given at onset of therapy; some patients may require more frequent injections.
 If Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) is indicated (see Table 1), an injection of 0.06 mL / kg of body weight should be administered intramuscularly (see PRECAUTIONS) as soon as possible after exposure and within 24 hours, if possible.
 Table 1 : (adapted from 20) Recommendations for Hepatitis B Prophylaxis Following Percutaneous or Permucosal Exposure
 Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) (0.5 mL) should be administered intramuscularly (IM) to the newborn infant after physiologic stabilization of the infant and preferably within 12 hours of birth.
 Hepatitis B Vaccine should be administered IM in three doses of 0.5 mL of vaccine (10 μg) each.
 If administration of the first dose of Hepatitis B Vaccine is delayed for as long as 3 months, then a 0.5 mL dose of Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) should be repeated at 3 months.
 All susceptible persons whose sex partners have acute hepatitis B infection should receive a single dose of HBIG (0.06 mL / kg) and should begin the hepatitis B vaccine series if prophylaxis can be started within 14 days of the last sexual contact or if sexual contact with the infected person will continue (see Table 2 below).
 Table 2 : (adapted from 21) Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis for Sexual Exposure to Hepatitis B
 Prophylactic treatment with a 0.5 mL dose of Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) and hepatitis B vaccine is indicated for infants < 12 months of age who have been exposed to a primary care - giver who has acute hepatitis B. Prophylaxis for other household contacts of persons with acute HBV infection is not indicated unless they have had identifiable blood exposure to the index patient, such as by sharing toothbrushes or razors.
 The recommended dose for BayRab (rabies immune globulin (human) solvent / detergent treated) is 20 IU / kg (0.133 mL / kg) of body weight given preferably at the time of the first vaccine dose.8,9 It may also be given through the seventh day after the first dose of vaccine is given.

 Adults and children 7 years and older: BayTet, 250 units should be given by deep intramuscular injection (see PRECAUTIONS).
 Children less than 7 years old: In small children the routine prophylactic dose of BayTet (tetanus immune globulin (human) solvent / detergent treated 250 units) may be calculated by the body weight (4.0 units / kg).
 However, it may be advisable to administer the entire contents of the vial or syringe of BayTet (tetanus immune globulin (human) solvent / detergent treated 250 units) (250 units) regardless of the child's size, since theoretically the same amount of toxin will be produced in the child's body by the infecting tetanus organism as it will in an adult's body.
 The physician must impress upon the patient the need for further toxoid injections in 1 month and 1 year.
 Persons who have received at least two doses of tetanus toxoid rapidly develop antibodies.2 The prophylactic dosage schedule for these patients and for those with incomplete or uncertain immunity is shown on the table in INDICATIONS.
 Standard therapy for the treatment of active tetanus including the use of BayTet (tetanus immune globulin (human) solvent / detergent treated 250 units) must be implemented immediately.

 Reconstituted BOTOX (200 Units / 30 mL) is injected into the detrusor muscle via a flexible or rigid cystoscope, avoiding the trigone.
 The injection needle should be filled (primed) with approximately 1 mL of reconstituted BOTOX prior to the start of injections (depending on the needle length) to remove any air.
 The needle should be inserted approximately 2 mm into the detrusor, and 30 injections of 1 mL (~6.7 Units) each (total volume of 30 mL) should be spaced approximately 1 cm apart (see Figure 1).
 For the final injection, approximately 1 mL of sterile normal saline should be injected so that the remaining BOTOX in the needle is delivered to the bladder.
 Patients should be considered for re - injection when the clinical effect of the previous injection diminishes (median time to qualification for re - treatment in the double - blind, placebo - controlled clinical studies was 295 - 337 days [42 - 48 weeks] for BOTOX 200 Units), but no sooner than 12 weeks from the prior bladder injection.
 The recommended dilution is 200 Units / 4 mL or 100 Units / 2 mL, with a final concentration of 5 Units per 0.1 mL (see Table 1).
 The recommended dose for treating chronic migraine is 155 Units administered intramuscularly using a sterile 30 - gauge, 0.5 inch needle as 0.1 mL (5 Units) injections per each site.
 The recommended dilution is 200 Units / 4 mL or 100 Units / 2 mL with preservative - free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (see Table 1).
 The lowest recommended starting dose should be used, and no more than 50 Units per site should generally be administered.
 In clinical trials, doses ranging from 75 Units to 400 Units were divided among selected muscles (see Table 3 and Figure 2) at a given treatment session.
 The recommended dose for treating lower limb spasticity is 300 Units to 400 Units divided among 5 muscles (gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus) (see Table 4 and Figure 3).
 The mean BOTOX dose administered to patients in this study was 236 Units (25th to 75th percentile range of 198 Units to 300 Units).
 Limiting the total dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle to 100 Units or less may decrease the occurrence of dysphagia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended dilution is 200 Units / 2 mL, 200 Units / 4 mL, 100 Units / 1 mL, or 100 Units / 2 mL with preservative - free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, depending on volume and number of injection sites desired to achieve treatment objectives (see Table 1).
 In general, no more than 50 Units per site should be administered using a sterile needle (e.g., 25 - 30 gauge) of an appropriate length.
 The recommended dose is 50 Units per axilla.
 The recommended dilution is 100 Units / 4 mL with 0.9% preservative - free sterile saline (see Table 1).
 Using a sterile 30 gauge needle, 50 Units of BOTOX (2 mL) is injected intradermally in 0.1 to 0.2 mL aliquots to each axilla evenly distributed in multiple sites (10 - 15) approximately 1 - 2 cm apart.
 Each injection site has a ring of effect of up to approximately 2 cm in diameter.
 Each dose is injected to a depth of approximately 2 mm and at a 45° angle to the skin surface, with the bevel side up to minimize leakage and to ensure the injections remain intradermal.
 The initial recommended dose is 1.25 Units - 2.5 Units (0.05 mL to 0.1 mL volume at each site) injected into the medial and lateral pre - tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid and into the lateral pre - tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid.
 The recommended dilution to achieve 1.25 Units is 100 Units / 8 mL; for 2.5 Units it is 100 Units / 4 mL (see Table 1).
 However, there appears to be little benefit obtainable from injecting more than 5 Units per site.
 The cumulative dose of BOTOX treatment for blepharospasm in a 30 - day period should not exceed 200 Units.
 The initial listed doses of the reconstituted BOTOX [see Preparation and Dilution Technique] typically create paralysis of the injected muscles beginning one to two days after injection and increasing in intensity during the first week.
 About one half of patients will require subsequent doses because of inadequate paralytic response of the muscle to the initial dose, or because of mechanical factors such as large deviations or restrictions, or because of the lack of binocular motor fusion to stabilize the alignment.
 The recommended initial dose of BRAVELLE® for women who have received a GnRH agonist for pituitary suppression is 225 International Units.
 BRAVELLE® may be administered together with MENOPUR® (menotropins for injection, USP), and the total initial dose when the products are combined should not exceed 225 International Units (150 International Units of BRAVELLE® and 75 International Units of MENOPUR® or 75 International Units of BRAVELLE® and 150 International Units of MENOPUR®).
 BREO ELLIPTA 100 / 25 should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100 / 25 once daily, the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD.
 The recommended starting dosage is BREO ELLIPTA 100 / 25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200 / 25 administered as 1 inhalation once daily.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 200 / 25 once daily.
 The median time to onset, defined as a 100 - mL increase from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), was approximately 15 minutes after beginning treatment.
 Administer undiluted BRETYLIUM (bretylium tosylate injection ) TOSYLATE INJECTION at a dosage of 5mg / kg of body weight by rapid intravenous injection.
 If ventricular fibrillation persists, the dosage may be increased to 10mg / kg and repeated as necessary.
 For continuous suppression, dilute Bretylium (bretylium tosylate injection ) Tosylate Injection with Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride Injection, USP using the table below and administer the diluted solution as a constant infusion of 1 to 2mg Bretylium (bretylium tosylate injection ) Tosylate Injection per minute, (see Table below).
 When administering Bretylium (bretylium tosylate injection ) Tosylate Injection (or any potent medication) by continuous intravenous infusion, it is advisable to use a precision volume control device.
 An alternative maintenance schedule is to infuse the diluted solution at a dosage of 5 to 10mg Bretylium (bretylium tosylate injection ) Tosylate per kg body weight, over a period greater than 8 minutes, every 6 hours.
 Administer the diluted solution at a dosage of 5 to 10mg bretylium (bretylium tosylate injection ) tosylate per kg of body weight by intravenous infusion over a period greater than 8 minutes.
 For maintenance therapy, the same dosage may be administered every 6 hours, or a constant infusion of 1 to 2mg bretylium (bretylium tosylate injection ) tosylate per minute may be given, (See following table).
 Inject 5 to 10mg bretylium (bretylium tosylate injection ) tosylate per kg of body weight.
 The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step - wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate.
 Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases.
 BREVIBLOC was tested for compatibility with ten commonly used intravenous fluids at a final concentration of 10 mg esmolol hydrochloride per mL.
 28 - Day Schedule: For a DAY 1 START, count the first day of menstrual flow as Day 1 and the first tablet (white or yellow - green or blue) is then taken on Day 1.
 With either a Day 1 START or SUNDAY START, 1 tablet (white or yellow - green or blue) is taken each day at the same time for 21 days.
 1% solutions (10 mg / mL) should be prepared for intermittent intravenous and rectal administration; 0.2% solutions (2 mg / mL) should be prepared for continuous intravenous drug administration; 5% solutions (50 mg / mL) should be prepared for intramuscular administration.
 When the first dilution is made with the 2.5 g, the solution in the vial will be yellow.
 For continuous drip anesthesia, prepare a 0.2% solution by adding 500 mg of Brevital Sodium to 250mL of diluent.
 The dose required for induction may range from 50 to 120 mg or more but averages about 70 mg.
 The usual dosage in adults ranges from 1 to 1.5 mg / kg.
 Intermittent injections of about 20 to 40 mg (2 to 4 mL of a 1% solution) may be given as required, usually every 4 to 7 minutes.
 For continuous drip, the average rate of administration is about 3 mL of a 0.2% solution / minute (1 drop / second).
 For the induction of anesthesia by the intramuscular route of administration, the usual dose ranges from 6.6 to 10 mg / kg of the 5% concentration.
 For rectal administration, the usual dose for induction is 25 mg / kg using the 1% solution.

 Administer BRIDION intravenously as a single bolus injection.
 BRIDION has only been administered as a single bolus injection in clinical trials.
 In the management of ACS, initiate BRILINTA treatment with a 180 mg loading dose.
 Administer 90 mg twice daily during the first year after an ACS event.
 After one year administer 60 mg twice daily.
 Use BRILINTA with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75 - 100 mg [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Clinical Studies].
 A patient who misses a dose of BRILINTA should take one tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time.
 The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals.
 Dosage should then be increased to 20 mg / day, as tolerated, because higher doses demonstrated better treatment effects in trials conducted in the United States.
 The efficacy and safety of doses above 20 mg / day have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
 A dose decrease down to 5 mg / day may be considered for patients who do not tolerate higher doses [see Clinical Studies].
 Although BRINTELLIX can be abruptly discontinued, in placebo - controlled trials patients experienced transient adverse reactions such as headache and muscle tension following abrupt discontinuation of BRINTELLIX 15 mg / day or 20 mg / day.
 To avoid these adverse reactions, it is recommended that the dose be decreased to 10 mg / day for one week before full discontinuation of BRINTELLIX 15 mg / day or 20 mg / day [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with BRINTELLIX is unclear.
 The maximum recommended dose of BRINTELLIX is 10 mg / day in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.
 The recommended dosage of BRISDELLE for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS is 7.5 mg once daily, at bedtime, with or without food.
 The recommended starting dosage is 50 mg twice daily (100 mg per day).
 Based on individual patient tolerability and therapeutic response, the dosage may be adjusted down to 25 mg twice daily (50 mg per day) or up to 100 mg twice daily (200 mg per day) [see Clinical Studies].
 BRIVIACT injection is for single dose only.
 For all stages of hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dosage is 25 mg twice daily (50 mg per day) and the recommended maximum dosage is 75 mg twice daily (150 mg per day) [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 For the treatment of postoperative inflammation in patients who have undergone cataract extraction, one drop of Bromday (bromfenac ophthalmic solution) ophthalmic solution should be applied to the affected eye(s) once daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery, and through the first 14 days of the postoperative period.
 One drop of BromSite should be applied to the affected eye twice daily (morning and evening) 1 day prior to surgery, the day of surgery, and 14 days postsurgery.
 The recommended dose of BROVANA (arformoterol tartrate) Inhalation Solution is one 15 mcg unitdose vial administered twice daily (morning and evening) by nebulization.
 A total daily dose of greater than 30 mcg (15 mcg twice daily) is not recommended.
 If preferred, the contents of the BSS PLUS Part II component may be aspirated with an 18 - gauge cannula attached to a 10 mL syringe and then transferred into the Part I bottle.
 The usual adult target dose for BUDEPRION XL™ (bupropion hydrochloride extended - release tablets) is 300 mg / day, given once daily in the morning.
 Dosing with BUDEPRION XL™ (bupropion hydrochloride extended - release tablets) should begin at 150 mg / day given as a single daily dose in the morning.
 If the 150 mg initial dose is adequately tolerated, an increase to the 300 mg / day target dose, given as once daily, may be made as early as day 4 of dosing.
 An increase in dosage to the maximum of 450 mg / day, given as a single dose, may be considered for patients in whom no clinical improvement is noted after several weeks of treatment at 300 mg / day.
 Patients who are currently being treated with bupropion hydrochloride tablets at 300 mg / day (for example, 100 mg 3 times a day) may be switched to BUDEPRION XL (bupropion hydrochloride extended - release tablets) ™ 300 mg once daily.
 Patients who are currently being treated with bupropion hydrochloride sustained - release tablets at 300 mg / day (for example, 150 mg twice daily) may be switched to BUDEPRION XL™ 300 mg once daily.
 The dose should not exceed 150 mg every other day in these patients.
 The usual total daily dosage of Bumex (bumetanide) is 0.5 mg to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose.
 If the diuretic response to an initial dose of Bumex (bumetanide) is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4 - to 5 - hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby Bumex (bumetanide) is given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema.
 Because cross - sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, Bumex (bumetanide) can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of Bumex (bumetanide) to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.
 Initial dosage range for adults is 100 to 200 mL and for children 2.5 to 5 mL per kilogram body weight.
 Calculate the body albumin compartment to be 80 to 100 mL per kg of body weight when using the patient's serum albumin concentration to estimate the deficit.5,6 Do not exceed a daily dose of 2 g of albumin per kilogram of body weight.
 Make certain that the administration set contains an adequate filter (15 - micron or smaller).
 Although the volume of BUMINATE 5%, Albumin (Human), 5% Solution administered must be individualized, the initial dose should be 250 to 500 mL for older children and adults and 12 to 20 mL per kilogram of body weight for infants and young children.
 When using the patient's serum albumin concentration to estimate the deficit, the body albumin compartment should be calculated to be 80 to 100 mL per kilogram of body weight.5,6 Daily dose should not exceed 2 g of albumin per kilogram of body weight.
 When BUMINATE 5%, Albumin (Human), 5% Solution is administered after the first 24 hours following burns, an initial dose of 500 mL is recommended.
 BUNAVAIL buccal film is applied to the buccal mucosa as a single daily dose.
 A BUNAVAIL 4.2 / 0.7 mg buccal film provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to a SUBOXONE 8 / 2 mg sublingual tablet.
 Note that when two films are required for one dose, the patient should place one film on the inside of one cheek and the other film on the inside of the other cheek.
 For doses requiring multiple films, no more than two films should be applied to the inside of one cheek at a time.
 A BUNAVAIL 4.2 / 0.7 mg buccal film provides equivalent buprenorphine exposure to a SUBOXONE 8 / 2 mg sublingual tablet.
 The usual total daily dose of BUPHENYL Tablets and Powder for patients with urea cycle disorders is 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in patients weighing less than 20 kg, or 9.9 - 13.0 g / m² / day in larger patients.
 Sodium phenylbutyrate is very soluble in water (5 grams per 10 mL).
 Each level teaspoon (enclosed) dispenses 3.2 grams of powder and 3.0 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate.
 Each level tablespoon (enclosed) dispenses 9.1 grams of powder and 8.6 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate.
 The safety or efficacy of doses in excess of 20 grams (40 tablets) per day has not been established.
 At the recommended dose of sodium phenylbutyrate, it is suggested that infants with neonatal - onset CPS and OTC deficiencies initially receive a daily dietary protein intake limited to approximately 1.6 g / kg / day for the first 4 months of life.
 If tolerated, the daily protein intake may be increased to 1.9 g / kg / day during this period.
 From 4 months to 1 year of age, it is recommended that the infant receive at least 1.4 g / kg / day, but 1.7 g / kg / day is advisable.
 From 1 to 3 years of age, the protein intake should not be less than 1.2 g / kg / day; 1.4 g / kg / day is advisable during this period.
 Citrulline supplementation is required and recommended for patients diagnosed with neonatal - onset deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase; citrulline daily intake is recommended at 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m² / day.
 The free - base form of arginine may be used instead of citrulline in patients with milder forms of carbamylphosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (daily intake is recommended at 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m² / day).
 Adults: The usual dosage for persons 13 years of age and over is 1 ml Buprenex (buprenorphine) (0.3 mg buprenorphine) given by deep intramuscular or slow (over at least 2 minutes) intravenous injection at up to 6 - hour intervals, as needed.
 Repeat once (up to 0.3 mg) if required, 30 to 60 minutes after initial dosage, giving consideration to previous dose pharmacokinetics, and thereafter only as needed.
 Occasionally, it may be necessary to administer single doses of up to 0.6 mg to adults depending on the severity of the pain and the response of the patient.
 At this time, there are insufficient data to recommend single doses greater than 0.6 mg for long - term use.
 There is insufficient experience to recommend a dose in infants below the age of two years, single doses greater than 6 micrograms / kg of body weight, or the use of a repeat or second dose at 30 - 60 minutes (such as is used in adults).
 Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are administered sublingually as a single daily dose.
 For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue.
 The recommended initial dose is 15 mg daily (7.5 mg b.i.d.).
 To achieve an optimal therapeutic response, at intervals of 2 to 3 days the dosage may be increased 5 mg per day, as needed.
 The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day.
 In clinical trials allowing dose titration, divided doses of 20 mg to 30 mg per day were commonly employed.
 The diluent quantity should be 10 times the volume of BUSULFEX, so that the final concentration of busulfan is approximately 0.5 mg per mL.
 (70 kg patient) x (0.8 mg per kg) ÷ (6 mg per mL) =9.3 mL BUSULFEX (56 mg total dose).
 To prepare the final solution for infusion, add 9.3 mL of BUSULFEX to 93 mL of diluent (normal saline or D5W) as calculated below:
 (9.3 mL BUSULFEX) x (10) =93 mL of either diluent plus the 9.3 mL of BUSULFEX to yield a final concentration of busulfan of 0.54 mg per mL (9.3 mL x 6 mg per mL ÷ 102.3 mL =0.54 mg per mL).
 Prior to and following each infusion, flush the indwelling catheter line with approximately 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.
 Daytime sedative - 15 to 30 mg, 3 or 4 times daily.
 Bedtime hypnotic - 50 to 100 mg.
 Preoperative sedative - 50 to 100 mg, 60 to 90 minutes before surgery.
 Preoperative sedative - 2 to 6 mg / kg maximum 100 mg.
 Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Less than 30 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day:
 Initiate treatment with BUTRANS 5 mcg / hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, middle column).
 Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Between 30 mg to 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day:
 Taper the patient's current around - the - clock opioids for up to 7 days to no more than 30 mg of morphine or equivalent per day before beginning treatment with BUTRANS.
 Then initiate treatment with BUTRANS 10 mcg / hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, right column).
 Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Greater than 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day:
 BUTRANS 20 mcg / hour may not provide adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than 80 mg / day oral morphine equivalents.
 Table 1: Initial BUTRANS Dose
 The minimum BUTRANS titration interval is 72 hours, based on the pharmacokinetic profile and time to reach steady state levels [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The maximum BUTRANS dose is 20 mcg / hour.
 In a clinical trial, BUTRANS 40 mcg / hour (given as two BUTRANS 20 mcg / hour systems) resulted in prolongation of the QTc interval [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Dose adjustments may be made in 5 mcg / hour, 7.5 mcg / hour, or 10 mcg / hour increments by using no more than two patches of the 5 mcg / hour, 7.5 mcg / hour, or 10 mcg / hour system(s).
 For the use of two patches, patients should be instructed to remove their current patch, and apply the two new patches at the same time, adjacent to one another at a different application site [see Administration of BUTRANS].
 BYDUREON (2 mg per dose) should be administered once every 7 days (weekly).
 If a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not administer the missed dose and instead resume BYDUREON with the next regularly scheduled dose.
 BYETTA (exenatide injection) should be initiated at 5 mcg administered twice daily at any time within the 60 - minute period before the morning and evening meals (or before the two main meals of the day, approximately 6 hours or more apart).
 Based on clinical response, the dose of BYETTA (exenatide injection) can be increased to 10 mcg twice daily after 1 month of therapy.
 For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.
 For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2 - week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial.
 In patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr less than 30 mL / min) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed.
 In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed.
 As initial therapy and in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 80 mg or nebivolol up to and including 10 mg, the recommended dose of BYVALSON is one tablet, 5 mg / 80 mg (nebivolol / valsartan) taken orally once daily.
 BYVALSON may be substituted for its components in patients already receiving 5 mg nebivolol and 80 mg valsartan.
 Adults and Adolescents: A single 1.0 gram initial dose of Ca - DTPA (pentetate calcium trisodium inj) administered intravenously.

 The maximum daily dose should not exceed 1.0 gram per day.
 Ca - DTPA (pentetate calcium trisodium inj) solution (1 gram in 5 mL) should be administered either with a slow intravenous push over a period of 3 - 4 minutes or by intravenous infusion diluted in 100 - 250 mL of 5% dextrose in water (D5W), Ringers Lactate, or Normal Saline.
 The recommended daily dose of CABOMETYX is 60 mg. Do not administer CABOMETYX with food.
 Withhold CABOMETYX for NCI CTCAE Grade 4 adverse reactions, and for Grade 3 or intolerable Grade 2 adverse reactions that cannot be managed with a dose reduction or supportive care.
 Upon resolution / improvement (i.e., return to baseline or resolution to Grade 1) of an adverse reaction, reduce the dose as follows:
 Reduce the daily CABOMETYX dose by 20 mg (for example, from 60 mg to 40 mg daily or from 40 mg to 20 mg daily).
 Increase the daily CABOMETYX dose by 20 mg (for example, from 60 mg to 80 mg daily or from 40 mg to 60 mg daily) as tolerated.
 The daily dose of CABOMETYX should not exceed 80 mg [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Reduce the starting dose of CABOMETYX to 40 mg once daily in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.
 The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.
 Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.
 The recommended dose of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 – 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.
 Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.
 The recommended dose range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5 – 10 mg once daily.
 In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies].
 The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6 – 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily.
 Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies].
 The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily.
 Patients who require a large reduction in LDL - C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily.
 The dosage range of atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily.
 Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food.
 The dosage range of atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily.
 In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, limit therapy with atorvastatin to 20 mg, and make appropriate clinical assessment to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed.
 In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, limit therapy with atorvastatin to 40 mg, and make appropriate clinical assessment to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 mg / day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg / day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population).
 NOTE THAT THE DOSE OF CAFFEINE BASE IS ONE - HALF THE DOSE WHEN EXPRESSED AS CAFFEINE CITRATE (e.g., 20 mg of caffeine citrate is equivalent to 10 mg of caffeine base).
 Serious toxicity has been associated with serum levels greater than 50 mg / L.
 To test for drug compatibility with common intravenous solutions or medications, 20 mL of caffeine citrate injection w ere combined with 20 mL of a solution or medication, with the exception of an Intralipid® admixture, which was combined as 80 mL / 80 mL.
 Adults: Take 2 tablets at the start of attack; 1 additional tablet every 1 / 2 hour, if needed for full relief (maximum 6 tablets per attack, 10 per week).
 Maximum Adult Dosage: Total dose for any one attack should not exceed 6 tablets.
 Total weekly dosage should not exceed 10 tablets.
 Caffeine and Sodium Benzoate Injection (caffeine alkaloid) may be administered by intramuscular or slow intravenous injection Some clinicians suggest that when used as a mild CNS stimulant to overcome fatigue, oral doses of 100 200 mg of anhydrous caffeine are required.
 One manufacturer recommends that citrated caffeine administered orally in dosages of 65 - 325 mg (about 32 - 162 mg of anhydrous caffeine) 3 times daily.
 Another manufacturer recommends an oral dosage of 250 mg of anhydrous caffeine in an extended - release formulation once daily, but warns that the drug should not be administered less than 6 hours before retiring.
 However, the manufacturer of Caffeine Sodium Benzoate Injection recommends intramuscular, or in emergency respiratory failure, intravenous injection of 500 mg of the drug (about 250 mg of anhydrous caffeine) or a maximum single dose of 1 gram (about 500 mg of anhydrous caffeine) for the treatment of respiratory depression associated with overdosage of CNS depressants, including narcotic analgesics and alcohol, and with electric shock.
 The usual dose is 0.5 g (7½ grains) as frequently as directed by the physician.
 The maximum safe dose 0.5 g and the total dose in 24 hours should rarely exceed 2.5 g.

 The initial dose of CAPOTEN (captopril tablets, USP) is 25 mg b.i.d.
 If satisfactory reduction of blood pressure has not been achieved after one or two weeks, the dose may be increased to 50 mg b.i.d.
 The dose of CAPOTEN in hypertension usually does not exceed 50 mg t.i.d.
 Therefore, if the blood pressure has not been satisfactorily controlled after one to two weeks at this dose, (and the patient is not already receiving a diuretic), a modest dose of a thiazide - type diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg daily), should be added.
 If further blood pressure reduction is required, the dose of CAPOTEN may be increased to 100 mg b.i.d.
 and then, if necessary, to 150 mg b.i.d.
 The usual dose range is 25 to 150 mg b.i.d.
 A maximum daily dose of 450 mg CAPOTEN should not be exceeded.
 For patients with severe hypertension (e.g., accelerated or malignant hypertension), when temporary discontinuation of current antihypertensive therapy is not practical or desirable, or when prompt titration to more normotensive blood pressure levels is indicated, diuretic should be continued but other current antihypertensive medication stopped and CAPOTEN dosage promptly initiated at 25 mg b.i.d.
 In patients with either normal or low blood pressure, who have been vigorously treated with diuretics and who may be hyponatremic and / or hypovolemic, a starting dose of 6.25 or 12.5 mg t.i.d.

 After a dose of 50 mg t.i.d.
 Most patients studied have had a satisfactory clinical improvement at 50 or 100 mg t.i.d.
 A maximum daily dose of 450 mg of CAPOTEN should not be exceeded.
 The recommended dose for long - term use in patients following a myocardial infarction is a target maintenance dose of 50 mg t.i.d.
 After a single dose of 6.25 mg, CAPOTEN therapy should be initiated at 12.5 mg t.i.d.
 CAPOTEN should then be increased to 25 mg t.i.d.
 during the next several days and to a target dose of 50 mg t.i.d.
 The recommended dose of CAPOTEN for long term use to treat diabetic nephropathy is 25 mg t.i.d.
 Alternatively, therapy may be instituted with a single tablet of CAPOZIDE (captopril and hydrochlorothiazide) Ò 25 mg / 15 mg taken once daily.

 If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg daily may be worthwhile.
 If no effect is observed after 6 weeks on 400 mg daily, a response is not likely and consideration should be given to alternate treatment options.
 For management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea, the dosage is 400 mg initially, followed by an additional 200 mg dose if needed on the first day.
 On subsequent days, the recommended dose is 200 mg twice daily as needed.
 The initial dosage of CELESTONE Syrup (betamethasone) may vary from 0.6 mg to 7.2 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of betamethasone for a week followed by 12 mg every other day for one month are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuro - psychiatric).
 The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg / kg / day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg / m2 bsa / day).

 Celexa (citalopram HBr) should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dose of 40 mg / day at an interval of no less than one week.
 Doses above 40 mg / day are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation.
 Additionally, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg / day dose over the 40 mg / day dose.
 20 mg / day is the maximum recommended dose for patients who are greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or those patients taking cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor.
 In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of Celexa (20 - 60 mg / day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of Celexa 20 or 40 mg / day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment.
 If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg / day can be considered.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with Celexa is unclear.
 A dose of 1 g administered orally or intravenously (over NO LESS THAN 2 HOURS) twice a day (daily dose of 2 g) is recommended for use in renal transplant patients.
 Although a dose of 1.5 g administered twice daily (daily dose of 3 g) was used in clinical trials and was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage could be established for renal transplant patients.
 Patients receiving 2 g / day of CellCept demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g / day of CellCept.

 Administer CEPROTIN at a maximum injection rate of 2 mL per minute except for children with a body weight of < 10 kg, where the injection rate should not exceed a rate of 0.2 mL / kg / minute.
 Dosage: The usual adult dosage is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours.
 Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL / min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion.
 In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of CEPTAZ (ceftazidime) may be given.
 In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of CEPTAZ (ceftazidime) daily were it not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose given in the table above may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately.
 In patients undergoing hemodialysis, a loading dose of 1 gram is recommended, followed by 1 gram after each hemodialysis period.
 In such patients, a loading dose of 1 gram of CEPTAZ (ceftazidime) may be given, followed by 500 mg every 24 hours.
 Intramuscular Administration:For IM administration, CEPTAZ (ceftazidime) should be constituted with one of the following diluents: Sterile Water for Injection, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, or 0.5% or 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection.
 Slowly inject directly into the vein over a period of 3 to 5 minutes or give through the tubing of an administration set while the patient is also receiving one of the compatible IV fluids (see Compatibility And Stability).

 1.5 mg of fosphenytoin sodium is equivalent to 1 mg phenytoin sodium, and is referred to as 1 mg PE.
 CEREBYX is marketed in 2 mL vials containing a total of 100 mg PE and 10 mL vials containing a total of 500 mg PE.
 Both vials contain a concentration of 50 mg PE / mL.
 Errors have occurred when the concentration of the vial (50 mg PE / mL) was misinterpreted to mean that the total content of the vial was 50 mg PE.
 These errors have resulted in two - or ten - fold overdoses of CEREBYX since each of the vials actually contains a total of 100 mg PE or 500 mg PE.
 Additionally, when ordering and storing CEREBYX, consider displaying the total drug content (i.e., 100 mg PE / 2 mL or 500 mg PE / 10 mL) instead of concentration in computer systems, pre - printed orders, and automated dispensing cabinet databases to help ensure that total drug content can be clearly identified.
 Prior to IV infusion, dilute CEREBYX in 5% dextrose or 0.9% saline solution for injection to a concentration ranging from 1.5 to 25 mg PE / mL.
 The maximum concentration of CEREBYX in any solution should be 25 mg PE / mL.

 The recommended dose of Comtan (entacapone) is one 200 mg tablet administered concomitantly with each levodopa and carbidopa dose to a maximum of 8 times daily (200 mg x 8 = 1,600 mg per day).
 Clinical experience with daily doses above 1,600 mg is limited.
 In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.
 In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction.
 (More than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction.)
 Infants born to HBsAg negative mothers should be vaccinated with three 0.5 mL doses of COMVAX, ideally at 2, 4, and 12 - 15 months of age.
 Children who receive one dose of hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth may be administered COMVAX on the schedule of 2, 4, and 12 - 15 months of age.

 Initiating dosage with 250 mg / day, and increasing gradually to the requisite amount, gives closer control of the effects of the drug and may help to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions.
 Dosage must be individualized to an amount that limits cystine excretion to 100 - 200 mg / day in those with no history of stones, and below 100 mg / day in those who have had stone formation and / or pain.
 The standard nitroprusside cyanide test has been reported useful as a qualitative measure of the effective dose:† Add 2 mL of freshly prepared 5 percent sodium cyanide to 5 mL of a 24 - hour aliquot of protein - free urine and let stand ten minutes.
 Add 5 drops of freshly prepared 5 percent sodium nitroprusside and mix.
 Two or three months may be required before the first evidence of a clinical response is noted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 The currently recommended dosage regimen in rheumatoid arthritis begins with a single daily dose of 125 mg or 250 mg, which is thereafter increased at one to three month intervals, by 125 mg or 250 mg / day, as patient response and tolerance indicate.
 If there is no improvement and there are no signs of potentially serious toxicity after two to three months of treatment with doses of 500 - 750 mg / day, increases of 250 mg / day at two to three month intervals may be continued until a satisfactory remission occurs (see Maintenance Therapy) or signs of toxicity develop (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS).
 If there is no discernible improvement after three to four months of treatment with 1000 to 1500 mg of penicillamine / day, it may be assumed the patient will not respond and CUPRIMINE should be discontinued.
 In those patients who do respond, but who evidence incomplete suppression of their disease after the first six to nine months of treatment, the daily dosage of CUPRIMINE may be increased by 125 mg or 250 mg / day at three - month intervals.
 It is unusual in current practice to employ a dosage in excess of 1 g / day, but up to 1.5 g / day has sometimes been required.
 If the patient has been in remission for six months or more, a gradual, stepwise dosage reduction in decrements of 125 mg or 250 mg / day at approximately three month intervals may be attempted.
 Based on clinical experience, dosages up to 500 mg / day can be given as a single daily dose.
 Dosages in excess of 500 mg / day should be administered in divided doses.
 The initial recommended dose is 2.5 mL / kg birth weight (see Table 1), administered as one or two aliquots depending upon the instillation procedure [see Preparation of the CUROSURF Suspension].
 Up to two repeat doses of 1.25 mL / kg birth weight each may be administered at approximately 12 - hour intervals in infants who remain intubated and in whom RDS is considered responsible for their persisting or deteriorating respiratory status.
 The maximum recommended total dosage (sum of the initial and up to two repeat doses) is 5 mL / kg.
 Table 1: CUROSURF Weight - Based Dosing Chart for Rescue Treatment of RDS
 Example 1: A patient with a body weight of 70 kg who is on a weekly treatment has a measured IgG trough level of 600 milligrams / dL, and the target trough level is 800 milligrams / dL.
 The desired target trough level difference is 200 milligrams / dL (800 milligrams / dL minus 600 milligrams / dL).
 The weekly dose of CUVITRU should be increased by 13 mL.
 Example 2: A patient with a body weight of 50 kg who is on a biweekly treatment has a measured IgG trough of 900 milligrams / dL, and the target trough level is 700 milligrams / dL.
 The desired target trough level difference is 200 milligrams / dL (900 milligrams / dL minus 700 milligrams / dL).
 The biweekly dose of CUVITRU should be decreased by 19 mL.
 For subsequent infusions, the infusion rate may be increased to 60 mL / hr / site as tolerated (e.g., 60 mL / hr / site x 2 sites = 120 mL / hr).
 For patients utilizing 4 infusion sites, the maximum infusion rate for all sites combined is 240 mL / hr.
 Initiate dosing at 0.02 mg / kg orally three times daily and titrate in increments of 0.02 mg / kg every 5 - 7 days based on therapeutic response and adverse reactions.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 0.1 mg / kg three times daily not to exceed 1.5 - 3 mg per dose based upon weight.
 A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection.
 This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life.
 Schilling Test: The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.
 The starting dose of hydroxocobalamin for adults is 5 g administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes (approximately 15 mL / min).
 Depending upon the severity of the poisoning and the clinical response, a second dose of 5 g may be administered by intravenous infusion for a total dose of 10 g. The rate of infusion for the second dose may r ange from 15 minutes (for patients in extremis) to two hours, as clinically indicated.
 The 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin for injection is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of diluent (not provided with Cyanokit) using the supplied sterile transfer spike.
 The line on the vial label represents 200 mL volume of diluent.
 One light yellow tablet is taken daily for 7 days, followed by 1 orange tablet daily for 7 days, 1 red tablet daily for 7 days, and then 1 green (inactive) tablet daily for 7 days.
 If a patient misses 1 active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive active tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive red (active) tablets in the third week or misses 3 or more active tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should keep taking 1 active tablet daily until the next Sunday.
 DAY 1 START
 Tablets are then taken sequentially without interruption as follows: One light yellow tablet daily for 7 days, then 1 orange tablet daily for 7 days, followed by 1 red tablet daily for 7 days and then 1 green (inactive) tablet daily for 7 days.
 If a patient misses 1 active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive active tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive red tablets in the third week or misses 3 or more active tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day.
 ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH SUNDAY AND DAY 1 STARTS

 Administer CYMBALTA 60 mg once daily.
 Begin treatment at 30 mg for one week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily.
 There is no evidence that higher doses confer additional benefit, even in patients who do not respond to a 60 mg dose, and higher doses are associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies].
 Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment, GFR <30 mL / min [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use In Specific Populations].
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with CYMBALTA is unclear.
 Each tablet contains 4 mg of cyproheptadine hydrochloride.
 The total daily dosage for pediatric patients may be calculated on the basis of body weight or body area using approximately 0.25 mg / kg / day or 8 mg per square meter of body surface (8 mg / m2).
 The usual dose is 2 mg (1 / 2 tablet) two or three times a day, adjusted as necessary to the size and response of the patient.
 The doe is not to exceed 12 mg a day.
 The usual dose is 4 mg (1 tablet) two or three times a day adjusted as necessary to the size and response of the patient.
 The dose is not to exceed 16 mg a day.
 The total daily dose for adults should bot exceed 0.5 mg / kg / day.
 The therapeutic range is 4 to 20 mg a day, with the majority of patients requiring 12 to 16 mg a day.
 An occasional patient may require as much as 32 mg a day for adequate relief.
 It is suggested that dosage be initiated with 4 mg (1 tablet) three times a day and adjusted according to the size and response of the patient.
 Store vials in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) until time of use.
 The usual dosage in adult and pediatric patients is 6 grams per day administered orally in divided doses of 3 grams twice daily.
 In pediatric patients less than 3 years of age, dosage may be started at 100 mg / kg / day divided in twice daily doses, and then increased weekly by 50 mg / kg increments.
 Dosage in all patients can be gradually increased until plasma total homocysteine is undetectable or present only in small amounts.
 Dosages of up to 20 grams per day have been necessary to control homocysteine levels in some patients.
 However, one pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic in vitro simulation study indicated minimal benefit from exceeding a twice - daily dosing schedule and a 150 mg / kg / day dosage for Cystadane (betaine anhydrous) .
 The prescribed amount of Cystadane (betaine anhydrous) should be measured with the measuring scoop provided (one level 1.7 mL scoop is equal to 1 gram of betaine anhydrous powder) and then dissolved in 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 mL) of water, juice, milk, or formula, or mixed with food for immediate ingestion.
 The recommended CYSTAGON® (cysteamine bitartrate) maintenance dose for children up to age 12 years is 1.30 grams / m2 / day of the free base, given in four divided doses.
 Patients over age 12 and over 110 pounds weight should receive 2.0 grams / day, divided four times daily.
 The CYSTAGON® (cysteamine bitartrate) dose can be increased to a maximum of 1.95 grams / m2 / day to achieve this level.
 The dose of 1.95 grams / m2 / day has been associated with an increased rate of withdrawal from treatment due to intolerance and an increased incidence of adverse events.
 The recommended maintenance dose of 1.30 grams / m2 / day can be approximated by administering CYSTAGON® (cysteamine bitartrate) according to the following table, which takes surface area as well as weight into consideration.
 Patients over age 12 and over 110 pounds should receive 2.0 grams / day given in four divided doses as a starting maintenance dose.
 The dose should be raised if the leukocyte cystine level remains > 2 nmol / ½ cystine / mg / protein.
 Instill one drop of CYSTARAN in each eye, every waking hour.
 The dose for retrograde use in cystography and voiding cystourethrography ranges from 25 to 300 mL depending on the age of the patient and the degree of bladder irritability; amounts greater than 300 mL may be used if the bladder capacity allows.
 The recommended dose for adults is 50 mL of reconstituted solution of Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) (2.2), instilled into the bladder via a urinary catheter (2.3).
 Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) is supplied as a kit containing two vials: a clear glass vial labeled as Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride) for Intravesical Solution, containing 100 mg hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride as a powder, and a vial labeled as DILUENT for Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) , containing 50 mL of the diluent in a polypropylene vial.
 Use a 50 mL syringe with a Luer Lock tip throughout the reconstitution procedure to ensure that the correct concentration (2mg / mL) of the drug is obtained and that a stable syringe - catheter connection is made for the bladder instillation of Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) .
 Remove the cap from the sterile 50 mL syringe and carefully retain it for subsequent reattachment to the syringe (step 4).
 Attach a needle to the syringe and withdraw 50 mL of the diluent (Figure 1).
 Figure 2
 Penetrate the stopper of the Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) powder vial with the needle and inject 10 mL of the diluent from the syringe into the powder vial (Figure 2).
 Withdraw all of the dissolved solution from the powder vial (10 mL) into the 50 mL syringe (Figure 4).
 Figure 5
 Slowly instill the solution of Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) into the bladder through the catheter (Figure 7), ensuring that the complete volume of the syringe (50 mL) is administered.
 The light source enables both white light cystoscopy and blue light (wavelength 360 – 450 nm) fluorescence cystoscopy.
 If the patient did not retain Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) in the bladder for 1 hour, allow 1 hour to pass from the instillation of Cysview (hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride intravesical solution) into the bladder to the start of the cystoscopic examination.
 Therapy should be initiated with 250 mg orally four times daily, preferably at 6 - hour intervals.
 If the level of cortisol suppression is inadequate, the dosage may be increased in increments of 250 mg daily at intervals of 1 - 2 weeks to a total daily dose of 2 g. Dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of therapy may be required in the event of adverse effects, including extreme drowsiness, severe skin rash, or excessively low cortisol levels.
 If glucocorticoid replacement therapy is needed, 20 - 30 mg of hydrocortisone orally in the morning will replace endogenous secretion.

 Dacogen (decitabine injection) is administered at a dose of 20 mg / m² by continuous intravenous infusion over 1 hour repeated daily for 5 days.
 If myelosuppression is present, subsequent treatment cycles of Dacogen (decitabine injection) should be delayed until there is hematologic recovery (ANC ≥ 1,000 / μL platelets ≥ 50,000 / μL ).
 Following the first cycle of Dacogen (decitabine injection) treatment, if any of the following non - hematologic toxicities are present, Dacogen (decitabine injection) treatment should not be restarted until the toxicity is resolved: 1) serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg / dL; 2) SGPT, total bilirubin ≥ 2 times ULN; 3) and active or uncontrolled infection.
 Dacogen (decitabine injection) should be aseptically reconstituted with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (USP); upon reconstitution, each mL contains approximately 5.0 mg of decitabine at pH 6.7 - 7.3.
 Immediately after reconstitution, the solution should be further diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose Injection, or Lactated Ringer's Injection to a final drug concentration of 0.1 - 1.0 mg / mL.
 The recommended dosage of DAKLINZA is 60 mg, taken orally, once daily, with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Table 1 provides the recommended DAKLINZA - containing treatment regimens and duration based on HCV genotype and patient population.
 For HCV genotype 1 or 3 patients with Child - Pugh B or C cirrhosis or post - transplantation patients, the starting dose of ribavirin is 600 mg once daily, increasing up to 1000 mg daily as tolerated.
 For HCV genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child - Pugh A), the recommended dosing of ribavirin is based on weight (1000 mg for patients weighing less than 75 kg and 1200 mg for those weighing at least 75 kg administered orally in two divided doses with food).

 The total daily dosage of Danazol for fibrocystic breast disease ranges from 100 mg to 400 mg given in two divided doses depending upon patient response.
 In most instances, breast pain and tenderness are significantly relieved by the first month and eliminated in 2 to 3 months.
 Usually elimination of nodularity requires 4 to 6 months of uninterrupted therapy.
 Regular menstrual patterns, irregular menstrual patterns, and amenorrhea each occur in approximately one - third of patients treated with 100 mg of Danazol.
 It is recommended that the patient be started on 200 mg, two or three times a day.
 After a favorable initial response is obtained in terms of prevention of episodes of edematous attacks, the proper continuing dosage should be determined by decreasing the dosage by 50% or less at intervals of one to three months or longer if frequency of attacks prior to treatment dictates.
 If an attack occurs, the daily dosage may be increased by up to 200 mg. During the dose adjusting phase, close monitoring of the patient's response is indicated, particularly if the patient has a history of airway involvement.
 In moderate to severe disease, or in patients infertile due to endometriosis, a starting dose of 800 mg given in two divided doses is recommended.
 For mild cases, an initial daily dose of 200 mg to 400 mg given in two divided doses is recommended and may be adjusted depending on patient response.
 It is essential that therapy continue uninterrupted for 3 to 6 months but may be extended to 9 months if necessary.
 The total daily dosage of DANOCRINE for fibrocystic breast disease ranges from 100 mg to 400 mg given in two divided doses depending upon patient response.

 Usually elimination of nodularity requires 4 to 6 months of uninterrupted therapy.
 Regular menstrual patterns irregular menstrual patterns and amenorrhea each occur in approximately one - third of patients treated with 100 mg of DANOCRINE.
 It is recommended that the patient be started on 200 mg, two or three times a day.
 After a favorable initial response is obtained in terms of prevention of episodes of edematous attacks, the proper continuing dosage should be determined by decreasing the dosage by 50% or less at intervals of one to three months or longer if frequency of attacks prior to treatment dictates.
 If an attack occurs, the daily dosage may be increased by up to 200 mg. During the dose adjusting phase, close monitoring of the patient's response is indicated, particularly if the patient has a history of airway involvement.
 Dantrium Intravenous should be administered by continuous rapid intravenous push beginning at a minimum dose of 1 mg / kg, and continuing until symptoms subside or the maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg / kg has been reached.
 Dantrium Intravenous: The recommended prophylactic dose of Dantrium Intravenous is 2.5 mg / kg, starting approximately 1 - 1 / 4 hours before anticipated anesthesia and infused over approximately 1 hour.
 Oral Administration of Dantrium Capsules: Administer 4 to 8 mg / kg / day of oral Dantrium in three or four divided doses for 1 or 2 days prior to surgery, with the last dose being given with a minimum of water approximately 3 to 4 hours before scheduled surgery.
 Post Crisis Follow - Up: Dantrium Capsules, 4 to 8 mg / kg / day, in four divided doses should be administered for 1 to 3 days following a malignant hyperthermia crisis to prevent recurrence of the manifestations of malignant hyperthermia.
 dose of Dantrium in the postoperative period must be individualized, starting with 1 mg / kg or more as the clinical situation dictates.
 PREPARATION: Each vial of Dantrium Intravenous should be reconstituted by adding 60 mL of sterile water for injection USP (without a bacteriostatic agent), and the vial shaken until the solution is clear.
 25 mg once daily for seven days, then 25 mg t.i.d.
 for seven days 50 mg t.i.d.
 for seven days 100 mg t.i.d.
 Doses higher than 100 mg four times daily should not be used.
 0.5 mg / kg once daily for seven days, then 0.5 mg / kg t.i.d.
 for seven days 1 mg / kg t.i.d.
 for seven days 2 mg / kg t.i.d.
 Doses higher than 100 mg four times daily should not be used.
 Preoperatively: Administer 4 to 8 mg / kg / day of oral Dantrium in 3 or 4 divided doses for one or two days prior to surgery, with the last dose being given approximately 3 to 4 hours before scheduled surgery with a minimum of water.
 Post Crisis Follow - up: Oral Dantrium should also be administered following a malignant hyperthermia crisis, in doses of 4 to 8 mg / kg per day in four divided doses, for a one to three day period to prevent recurrence of the manifestations of malignant hyperthermia.
 The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children.
 If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 - 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried.
 A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 ½ years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years.
 In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti - leprosy drugs.
 In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy.
 In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily.
 Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised.
 In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co - administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily.
 Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised.
 One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti - leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 - 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 - 500 mg daily.
 Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 - 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year.
 The majority can be classified into two groups.
 The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (“Reversal”) of existing skin and nerve lesions.
 Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients.
 DAPTACEL vaccine is to be administered as a 5 dose series at 2, 4 and 6 months of age (at intervals of 6 - 8 weeks), at 15 - 20 months of age and at 4 - 6 years of age.
 Four doses of DAPTACEL vaccine constitute a primary immunization course for pertussis.
 Three doses of DAPTACEL vaccine constitute a primary immunization course for diphtheria and tetanus.
 DAPTACEL vaccine should be used as the fifth dose of the DTaP series in children who initially received 4 doses of Pentacel® [(Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Inactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus b Conjugate (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate) vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur Limited].
 DAPTACEL vaccine may be used to complete the immunization series in infants who have received 1 or more doses of whole - cell pertussis DTP.
 Using a sterile needle and syringe and aseptic technique, withdraw and administer a single 0.5 mL dose of DAPTACEL vaccine intramuscularly.
 The adult starting dose is 50 to 75 mg of the drug daily, together with 1 to 4 g daily of a sulfonamide of the sulfapyrimidine type, e.g.
 The dosage may then be reduced to about one half that previously given for each drug and continued for an additional 4 to 5 weeks.
 The pediatric dosage of DARAPRIM is 1 mg / kg / day divided into 2 equal daily doses; after 2 to 4 days this dose may be reduced to one half and continued for approximately 1 month.
 However, DARAPRIM at a dosage of 25 mg daily for 2 days with a sulfonamide will initiate transmission control and suppression of non - falciparum malaria.
 Should circumstances arise wherein DARAPRIM must be used alone in semi - immune persons, the adult dosage for acute malaria is 50 mg for 2 days; children 4 through 10 years old may be given 25 mg daily for 2 days.
 Adults and pediatric patients over 10 years – 25 mg (1 tablet) once weekly Children 4 through 10 years – 12.5 mg (½ tablet) once weekly
 Infants and children under 4 years – 6.25 mg (¼ tablet) once weekly.

 The recommended dose of DARZALEX is 16 mg / kg actual body weight administered as an intravenous infusion according to the following dosing schedule in Table 1:
 The recommended dose of DARZALEX is 16 mg / kg actual body weight administered as an intravenous infusion according to the following dosing schedule in Table 2:
 Methylprednisolone 100 mg, or equivalent, administered intravenously.
 Following the second infusion, the dose of corticosteroid may be reduced (oral or intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg).
 Administer 20 mg dexamethasone prior to every DARZALEX infusion [Clinical Studies].
 Administer oral corticosteroid (20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose of an intermediate - acting or long - acting corticosteroid in accordance with local standards) on each of the 2 days following all DARZALEX infusions (beginning the day after the infusion).
 Consider administering low - dose oral methylprednisolone ( ≤ 20 mg) or equivalent, the day after the DARZALEX infusion.
 Before administration of DaTscan, administer Potassium Iodide Oral Solution or Lugol's Solution (equivalent to 100 mg iodide) or potassium perchlorate (400 mg) to block uptake of iodine 123 by the patient's thyroid.
 The recommended dose is 111 to 185 MBq (3 to 5 mCi) administered intravenously [see Clinical Studies].
 The Effective Dose resulting from a DaTscan administration with an administered activity of 185 MBq (5 mCi) is 3.94 mSv in an adult.
 Position the subject supine with the head on an off - the - table headrest, a flexible head restraint such as a strip of tape across the chin or forehead may be used to help avoid movement, and set a circular orbit for the detector heads with the radius as small as possible (typically 11 to 15 cm).
 Experimental studies with a striatal phantom suggest that optimal images are obtained with matrix size and zoom factors selected to give a pixel size of 3.5 to 4.5 mm.
 Reconstructed pixel size should be between 3.5 and 4.5 mm with slices 1 pixel thick.
 Figure 1,2,3 and 4
 For OA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg caplets) given orally once a day [see Individualization of Dosage].
 For RA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg caplets) given orally once a day [see Individualization of Dosage].
 The maximum recommended total daily dose of DAYPRO in adults is 1800 mg (26 mg / kg, whichever is lower) in divided doses.
 In children, doses greater than 1200 mg have not been studied.
 Patients with low body weight should initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily.
 Patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis should also initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily.
 If there is insufficient relief of symptoms in such patients, the dose may be cautiously increased to 1200 mg, but only with close monitoring [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 In adults, in cases where a quick onset of action is important, the pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin allows therapy to be started with a one - time loading dose of 1200 to 1800 mg (not to exceed 26 mg / kg).
 Doses larger than 1200 mg / day on a chronic basis should be reserved for patients who weigh more than 50 kg, have normal renal and hepatic function, are at low risk of peptic ulcer, and whose severity of disease justifies maximal therapy.
 Physicians should ensure that patients are tolerating doses in the 600 to 1200 mg / day range without gastroenterologic, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic adverse effects before advancing to the larger doses.
 Most patients will tolerate once - a - day dosing with DAYPRO, although divided doses may be tried in patients unable to tolerate single doses.
 Divided doses may be tried in patients unable to tolerate single doses.
 For osteoarthritis patients of low body weight or with milder disease, an initial dose of one 600 mg tablet once a day may be appropriate.
 The maximum total daily dose is 1200 mg.
 For OA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) given orally once a day.
 For RA, the dosage is 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) given orally once a day.

 For children aged 3 months to 12 years, the usual dosage range is 0.05 to 0.3 mL daily, either as a single dose or divided into two doses.
 About 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of patients can be controlled by a single daily dose of DDAVP administered intranasally.
 The nasal spray pump can only deliver doses of 0.1 mL (10 mcg) or multiples of 0.1 mL.
 The bottle will now deliver 10 mcg of drug per spray.
 Central Cranial Diabetes Insipidus: This drug is administered into the nose through a soft, flexible plastic rhinal tube which has four graduation marks on it that measure 0.2, 0.15, 0.1 and 0.05 mL.
 The usual dosage range in adults is 0.1 to 0.4 mL daily, either as a single dose or divided into two or three doses.
 Most adults require 0.2 mL daily in two divided doses.

 The recommended bolus dose for activated DEFINITY is 10 microliters (microL) / kg of the activated product by intravenous bolus injection within 30 - 60 seconds, followed by a 10 mL saline flush.
 If necessary, a second 10 microliters (microL) / kg dose followed by a second 10 mL saline flush may be administered 30 minutes after the first injection to prolong contrast enhancement.
 The recommended infusion dose for activated DEFINITY is via an IV infusion of 1.3 mL added to 50 mL of preservative - free saline.
 The rate of infusion should be initiated at 4.0 mL / minute, but titrated as necessary to achieve optimal image enhancement, not to exceed 10 mL / minute.
 In a crossover trial of 64 patients randomized to both bolus and infusion, the duration of clinically useful contrast enhancement for fundamental imaging was approximately 3.4 minutes after a 10 microL / kg bolus and was approximately 7.1 minutes during the continuous infusion of 1.3 mL activated DEFINITY in 50 mL saline at a rate of 4 mL / min.
 The recommended dosage of DEFITELIO for adult and pediatric patients is 6.25 mg / kg every 6 hours given as a 2 - hour intravenous infusion.

 It is recommended to use the Deflux metal needle (3.7F x 23G tip x 350 mm) for safe and accurate administration of Deflux.
 Several techniques have been described for the endoscopic treatment of VUR including a subureteric injection (STING procedure), a single intra - ureteric injection (HIT procedure) and a double (proximal and distal) intra - ureteric injection (Double - HIT procedure)1 - 6.
 If the ureteral orifice does not completely coapt with a single intraureteral injection, a second more distal intra - ureteral injection (Double - HIT) may be contemplated (Site 2; Fig.
 The dosage of Dehydrated (dehydrated alcohol (dehydrated alcohol injection) injection) Alcohol Injection for therapeutic nerve or ganglion block varies from as little as 0.05 to 0.5 mL in trigeminal neuralgia to 0.5 to 1.0 mL per interspace for subarachnoid injections.
 Doses larger than 1.5 mL are seldom required.
 A 1.0 mL tuberculin syringe is desirable to facilitate accurate measurement of the dose.
 A dose of 2 mL of 45% alcohol has been used for injecting individual motor nerves, or from 1.5 to 4.0 mL for epidural injection in children with spastic cerebral palsy; 50 mL of 50% alcohol has been used for celiac plexus blockade.
 The LD50 oral dose in rats is 13.7 g / kg.
 In general, total doses above 400 mg per month are not required because of the prolonged action of the preparation.
 Male hypogonadism: As replacement therapy, i.e., for eunuchism, the suggested dosage is 50 to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks.
 Dosage is within the range of 50 to 200 mg every 2 to 4 weeks for a limited duration, for example, 4 to 6 months.
 Palliation of inoperable mammary cancer in women: A dosage of 200 to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks is recommended.
 Since the 40 mg potency provides a high concentration in a small volume, particular care should be observed to administer the full dose.
 The initial dosage of DELTASONE Tablets may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.
 Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am.
 During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation.
 Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used.
 Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days.
 Other corticoids, including rnethylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, pednisone and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1 1 / 4 to 1 1 / 2 days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy.
 For adults, the recommended dosage of DELZICOL is two 400 mg capsules to be taken three times daily with or without food (total daily dose of 2.4 grams), for a duration of 6 weeks [see Clinical Studies].
 For pediatric patients 12 years of age and older, the recommended total daily dose of DELZICOL is weight - based (up to maximum of 2.4 grams / day).
 For the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, the recommended dose of DELZICOL in adults is 1.6 g daily with or without food in divided doses [see Clinical Studies].
 Two DELZICOL 400 mg capsules should not be substituted with one mesalamine delayed - release 800 mg tablet.
 The recommended initial dose is 10 mg or 20 mg oral DEMADEX once daily.
 Doses higher than 200 mg have not been adequately studied.
 The recommended initial dose is 20 mg oral DEMADEX once daily.
 Doses higher than 200 mg have not been adequately studied.
 The recommended initial dose is 5 mg or 10 mg oral DEMADEX once daily, administered together with an aldosterone antagonist or a potassium - sparing diuretic.
 Doses higher than 40 mg have not been adequately studied in this population.
 The recommended initial dose is 5 mg once daily.
 If the 5 mg dose does not provide adequate reduction in blood pressure within 4 to 6 weeks, increase to 10 mg once daily.
 If the response to 10 mg is insufficient, add another antihypertensive agent to the treatment regimen.
 The dose of DEMEROL should be proportionately reduced (usually by 25 to 50 percent) when administered concomitantly with phenothiazines and many other tranquilizers since they potentiate the action of DEMEROL.
 The usual dosage is 50 mg to 150 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 3 or 4 hours as necessary.
 The usual dosage is 0.5 mg / lb to 0.8 mg / lb intramuscularly or subcutaneously up to the adult dose, every 3 or 4 hours as necessary.
 The usual dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 30 to 90 minutes before the beginning of anesthesia.
 The usual dosage is 0.5 mg / lb to 1 mg / lb intramuscularly or subcutaneously up to the adult dose, 30 to 90 minutes before the beginning of anesthesia.
 Repeated slow intravenous injections of fractional doses (e.g., 10 mg / mL) or continuous intravenous infusion of a more dilute solution (e.g., 1 mg / mL) should be used.
 The usual dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously when pain becomes regular, and may be repeated at 1 - to 3 - hour intervals.
 The recommended initial dosage of DEMSER (metyrosine) for adults and children 12 years of age and older is 250 mg orally four times daily.
 This may be increased by 250 mg to 500 mg every day to a maximum of 4.0 g / day in divided doses.
 Optimally effective dosages of DEMSER (metyrosine) usually are between 2.0 and 3.0 g / day, and the dose should be titrated by monitoring clinical symptoms and catecholamine excretion.
 In patients who are usually normotensive, dosage should be titrated to the amount that will reduce urinary metanephrines and / or vanillylmandelic acid by 50 percent or more.
 In one clinical safety study, approximately 90 patients with epilepsy and with no measurable plasma levels of valproate were given single infusions of Depacon (up to 15 mg / kg and mean dose of 1184 mg) over 5 - 10 minutes (1.5 - 3.0 mg / kg / min).

 The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg / kg / day.
 If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.
 However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg / mL.
 Patients receiving doses near the maximum recommended daily dose of 60 mg / kg / day, particularly those not receiving enzyme - inducing drugs, should be monitored more closely.
 If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in a divided regimen.
 The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg / mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg / mL (males) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].

 The initial dosage of parenterally administered DEPO - MEDROL will vary from 4 to 120 mg depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection.
 Employing the same sterile technique as for a lumbar puncture, a sterile 20 to 24 gauge needle (on a dry syringe) is quickly inserted into the synovial cavity.
 A 20 to 24 gauge needle attached to a dry syringe is inserted into the bursa and the fluid aspirated.
 In many cases, a single injection causes a marked decrease in the size of the cystic tumor and may effect disappearance.
 The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures listed above varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg.
 Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion.
 It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions.
 One to four injections are usually employed, the intervals between injections varying with the type of lesion being treated and the duration of improvement produced by the initial injection.
 When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24 - hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of MEDROL® Tablets (methylprednisolone tablets, USP) is usually sufficient.
 When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.
 The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg / kg / day.
 In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate.
 For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg.
 The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks.
 In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg.
 In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.
 Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks.
 Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.
 In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.
 Doses of 400 mg to 1000 mg of DEPO - PROVERA Sterile Aqueous Suspension per week are recommended initially.
 If improvement is noted within a few weeks or months and the disease appears stabilized, it may be possible to maintain improvement with as little as 400 mg per month.
 depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104 must be given by subcutaneous injection into the anterior thigh or abdomen, once every 3 months (12 to 14 weeks).
 depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104 is not formulated for intramuscular injection.
 The pre - filled syringe of depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104 must be vigorously shaken just before use to create a uniform suspension.
 For example, patients switching from combined (estrogen plus progestin) contraceptives should have their first injection of depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104 within 7 days after the last day of using that method (7 days after taking the last active pill, removing the patch or ring).
 Similarly, contraceptive coverage will be maintained in switching from Depo - Provera CI (150 mg) to depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104, provided the next injection is given within the prescribed dosing period for Depo - Provera CI (150 mg).
 Treatment for longer than two years is not recommended, due to the impact of long - term depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104 on bone mineral density.
 Instructions for Use of depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104
 depo - subQ provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 104, as with other parenteral drug products, should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
 Insert the needle at a 45 degree angle so that most of the needle is in the fatty tissue.

 One white tablet is taken daily for 21 days, followed by 1 green (inactive) tablet daily for 7 days.
 If a patient misses 1 white (active) tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should keep taking 1 white tablet daily until the next Sunday.
 Tablets are then taken sequentially without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, then one green (inactive) tablet daily for 7 days.
 If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day.
 For treatment of children 6 years or older with a behavioral syndrome characterized by moderate to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability and impulsivity: an initial dose of 5 mg DESOXYN once or twice a day is recommended.
 Daily dosage may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until an optimum clinical response is achieved.
 The usual effective dose is 20 to 25 mg daily.
 The total daily dose may be given in two divided doses daily.
 One 5 mg tablet should be taken one - half hour before each meal.
 An initial dose of 150 mg / day in divided doses is suggested.

 The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg / day in divided doses.
 Inpatients (ie, more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg / day in divided doses.
 The initial recommended dose of DETROL Tablets is 2 mg twice daily.
 The dose may be lowered to 1 mg twice daily based on individual response and tolerability.
 For patients with significantly reduced hepatic or renal function or who are currently taking drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, the recommended dose of DETROL is 1 mg twice daily (see PRECAUTIONS, General, PRECAUTIONS, Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function, and DRUG INTERACTIONS).
 The recommended dose of DETROL LA Capsules is 4 mg once daily with water and swallowed whole.
 The dose may be lowered to 2 mg daily based on individual response and tolerability; however, limited efficacy data are available for DETROL LA 2 mg [see Clinical Studies].

 Only in rare cases will it be necessary to exceed a total of 40 mg per day.
 Based on the above factors, individuals with normal hemoglobin levels will have approximately 33 mg of blood iron per kilogram of body weight (15 mg / lb).
 Adults and Children over 15 kg (33 lbs): See Dosage Table.
 Dose (mL) = 0.0442 (Desired Hb - Observed Hb) x LBW + (0.26 x LBW)
 For males: LBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch of patient's height over 5 feet
 For females: LBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch of patient's height over 5 feet
 Children 5 - 15 kg (11 - 33 lbs): See Dosage Table.
 Dose (mL) = 0.0442 (Desired Hb - Observed Hb) x W + (0.26 x W)
 (Normal Hb for Children 15 kg or less is 12 g / dl)
 The formula shown below is based on the approximation that 1 mL of normocytic, normochromic red cells contains 1 mg of elemental iron:
 Example: Blood loss of 500 mL with 20% hematocrit
 Replacement Iron = 500 x 0.20 = 100 mg
 Dexferrum dose = 100 mg / 20 = 2 mL
 PRIOR TO THE FIRST DEXFERRUM THERAPEUTIC DOSE, ADMINISTER A TEST DOSE OF 0.5 ML INTRAVENOUSLY (See BOXED WARNING and PRECAUTIONS).
 Individual doses of 2 mL or less may be given on a daily basis until the calculated total amount required has been reached.
 Dexferrum is given undiluted at a s low gradual rate not to exceed 50 mg (1 mL) per minute.
 Each day's dose should ordinarily not exceed 0.5 mL (25 mg of iron) for infants under 5 kg (11 lbs); 1 mL (50 mg of iron) for children under 10 kg (22 lbs); and 2 mL (100 mg of iron) for other patients.
 Two 30 mg DEXILANT SoluTab are not interchangeable with one 60 mg DEXILANT capsule [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Table 1: Recommended DEXILANT Capsules Dosage Regimen by Indication in Patients 12 Years of Age and Older
 For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class B), the recommended dosage is a 30 mg DEXILANT capsule or DEXILANT SoluTab once daily for up to 8 weeks.
 Administration with Water via a NG Tube ( ≥ 16 French)
 45® (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should be administered in a dose of 1 mL intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously.
 The dose can be repeated, as needed, at 1 hour intervals to a total dose of 3 mL for intramuscular or subcutaneous delivery or 2 mL for intravenous delivery in a 24 hour period.
 The total weekly dosage should not exceed 6 mL.
 Serum calcium levels should be maintained between 9 to 10 mg per 100 mL.
 Initial dose: 0.8 mg to 2.4 mg daily for several days.
 Maintenance dose: 0.2 mg to 1.0 mg daily as required for normal serum calcium levels.
 The average maintenance dose is 0.6 mg daily.
 This dose may be supplemented with 10 to 15 grams of calcium lactate or gluconate by mouth daily.
 The usual starting dose of Diaβeta as initial therapy is 2.5 to 5 mg daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal.
 Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1.25 mg daily.
 Transfer of patients from other oral antidiabetic regimens to Diaβeta should be done conservatively and the initial daily dose should be 2.5 to 5 mg.
 Bioavailability studies have demonstrated that Glynase®* PresTab®* Tablets 3 mg are not bioequivalent to Diaβeta Tablets USP 5 mg.
 If the insulin dose is less than 20 units daily, substitution of Diaβeta 2.5 to 5 mg as a single daily dose may be tried.
 If the insulin dose is between 20 and 40 units daily, the patient may be placed directly on Diaβeta 5 mg daily as a single dose.
 If the insulin dose is more than 40 units daily, a transition period is required for conversion to Diaβeta.
 In these patients, insulin dosage is decreased by 50% and Diaβeta 5 mg daily is started.
 The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 1.25 to 20 mg daily, which may be given as a single dose or in divided doses (See Dosage Interval Section).
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 2.5 mg at weekly intervals based upon the patient’s blood glucose response.
 Although patients may be transferred from the maximum dose of other sulfonylureas, the maximum starting dose of 5 mg of Diaβeta should be observed.
 A maintenance dose of 5 mg Diaβeta provides approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 to 375 mg chlorpropamide, 250 to 375 mg tolazamide, 500 to 750 mg acetohexamide, or 1000 to 1500 mg tolbutamide.
 When transferring patients receiving more than 40 units of insulin daily, they may be started on a daily dose of Diaβeta 5 mg concomitantly with a 50% reduction in insulin dose.
 Progressive withdrawal of insulin and increase of Diaβeta in increments of 1.25 to 2.5 mg every 2 to 10 days is then carried out.
 Daily doses of more than 20 mg are not recommended.
 Some patients, particularly those receiving more than 10 mg daily, may have a more satisfactory response with twice - a - day dosage.
 For patients requiring more than 40 units of insulin daily, therapy with DIABINESE (chlorpropamide) may be initiated with a 50 per cent reduction in insulin for the first few days, with subsequent further reductions dependent upon the response.
 Dosage may subsequently be adjusted upward or downward by increments of not more than 50 to 125 mg at intervals of three to five days to obtain optimal control.
 Most moderately severe, middle - aged, stable type 2 diabetes patients are controlled by approximately 250 mg daily.
 Many investigators have found that some milder diabetics do well on daily doses of 100 mg or less.
 Many of the more severe diabetics may require 500 mg daily for adequate control.
 PATIENTS WHO DO NOT RESPOND COMPLETELY TO 500 MG DAILY WILL USUALLY NOT RESPOND TO HIGHER DOSES.
 MAINTENANCE DOSES ABOVE 750 mg DAILY SHOULD BE AVOIDED.
 The recommended dosage is 1 capsule (500 mg) two times a day.
 Usually 1 capsule is administered in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening.
 It may be necessary to adjust the dose, but it has usually been found that dosage in excess of 2 capsules (1 g) does not produce an increased effect.
 Use tablets or parenteral in accordance with the more frequent dosage schedules recommended for these dosage forms, such as 250 mg every four hours, or an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 250 mg or 125 mg every four hours, depending on the case in question.
 Acute Mountain Sickness: Dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, in divided doses using tablets or extended - release capsules as appropriate.
 In circumstances of rapid ascent, such as in rescue or military operations, the higher dose level of 1000 mg is recommended.
 It is preferable to initiate dosing 24 to 48 hours before ascent and to continue for 48 hours while at high altitude, or longer as necessary to control symptoms.
 The fill volume depends on body size, usually from 2.0 to 2.5 liters per 1.73m² for adults.
 To avoid the risk of severe dehydration and hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein, it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with the lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange.
 Select appropriate formulation from Table 1 or 2.

 There is no need to adjust single dose therapy for vaginal candidiasis because of impaired renal function.
 In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of DIFLUCAN, an initial loading dose of 50 to 400 mg should be given.
 K × linear length or height (cm) / serum creatinine (mg / 100 mL)
 To reconstitute, add 24 mL of distilled water or Purified Water (USP) to fluconazole bottle and shake vigorously to suspend powder.
 Each bottle will deliver 35 mL of suspension.
 Dosage for Acute Ingestion of Unknown Amount: Twenty (20) vials (760 mg) of DIGIBIND (digoxin immune fab) is adequate to treat most life - threatening ingestions in both adults and children.
 The physician may consider administering 10 vials, observing the patient's response, and following with an additional 10 vials if clinically indicated.
 Dosage for Toxicity During Chronic Therapy: For adults, six vials (228 mg) usually is adequate to reverse most cases of toxicity.
 In infants and small children ( ≤ 20 kg) a single vial usually should suffice.
 Acute Ingestion of Known Amount: Each vial of DIGIBIND (digoxin immune fab) contains 38 mg of purified digoxin - specific Fab fragments which will bind approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin (or digitoxin).
 Thus one can calculate the total number of vials required by dividing the total digitalis body load in mg by 0.5 mg / vial (see Formula 1).
 Table 1 gives dosage estimates in number of vials for adults and children who have ingested a single large dose of digoxin and for whom the approximate number of tablets or capsules is known.
 The dose of DIGIBIND (digoxin immune fab) represented in Table 3 can be estimated by multiplying the dose (in number of vials) calculated from Formula 2 by the amount of DIGIBIND (digoxin immune fab) contained in a vial (38 mg / vial) (see Formula 3).
 For very small doses, a reconstituted vial can be diluted with 34 mL of sterile isotonic saline to achieve a concentration of 1 mg / mL.
 Formula 3: Dose (in mg) = (Dose [in # of vials]) (38 mg / vial)
 The contents in each vial to be used should be dissolved with 4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, by gentle mixing, to give a clear, colorless, approximately isosmotic solution with a protein concentration of 9.5 mg / mL.
 If it is not used immediately, it may be stored under refrigeration at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for up to 4 hours.
 Table 1 gives dosage estimates in number of vials for adults and children who have ingested a single large dose of digoxin and for whom the approximate number of tablets or capsules is known.
 Dose (in # of vials) = (Serum digoxin concentration in ng / mL)(weight in kg) / 100
 Dose (in mg) = (Dose in # of vials) (40 mg / vial)
 Dose (in # of vials) = (Serum digitoxin concentration in ng / mL) (weight in kg) / 1000
 About two - thirds of adults considered adequately digitalized (without evidence of toxicit y) have serum digoxin concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 2 ng / mL.
 Because of altered digoxin distribution and elimination, projected peak body stores for patients with renal insufficiency should be conservative (i.e., 6 to 10 mcg / kg) [see PRECAUTIONS].
 A single initial dose of 500 to 750 mcg (0.5 to 0.75 mg) of digoxin tablets usually produces a detectable effect in 0.5 to 2 hours that becomes maximal in 2 to 6 hours.
 Additional doses of 125 to 375 mcg (0.125 to 0.375 mg) may be given cautiously at 6 - to 8 - hour intervals until clinical evidence of an adequate effect is noted.
 The usual amount of digoxin tablets that a 70 - kg patient requires to achieve 8 to 12 mcg / kg peak body stores is 750 to 1,250 mcg (0.75 to 1.25 mg).
 Maintenance Dosing: The doses of digoxin used in controlled trials in patients with heart failure have ranged from 125 to 500 mcg (0.125 to 0.5 mg) once daily.
 Therapy is generally initiated at a dose of 250 mcg (0.25 mg) once daily in patients under age 70 with good renal function, at a dose of 125 mcg (0.125 mg) once daily in patients over age 70 or with impaired renal function, and at a dose of 62.5 mcg (0.0625 mg) in patients with marked renal impairment.
 Table 5 provides average daily maintenance dose requirements of digoxin tablets for patients with heart failure based upon lean body weight and renal function:
 Table 5: Usual Daily Maintenance Dose Requirements (mcg) of Digoxin for Estimated Peak Body Stores of 10 mcg / kg
 Example: Based on the above table, a patient in heart failure with an estimated lean body weight of 70 kg and a Ccr of 60 mL / min, should be given a dose of 250 mcg (0.25 mg) daily of digoxin tablets, usually taken after the morning meal.
 Atrial Fibrillation: Peak digoxin body stores larger than the 8 to 12 mcg / kg required for most patients with heart failure and normal sinus rhythm have been used for control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation.
 Dosage Adjustment When Changing Preparations: The difference in bioavailability between Digoxin injection or Digoxin Solution in Capsules and Digoxin Pediatric Elixir or digoxin tablets must be considered when changing patients from one dosage form to another.
 Doses of 100 mcg (0.1 mg) and 200 mcg (0.2 mg) of Digoxin Solution in Capsules are approximately equivalent to 125 - mcg (0.125 - mg) and 250 - mcg (0.25 - mg) doses of digoxin tablets and Pediatric Elixir, respectively.
 Hypertension: Dosages must be adjusted to each patient's needs, starting with 180 mg or 240 mg once daily.
 Individual patients, particularly ≥ 60 years of age, may respond to a lower dose of 120 mg.
 The usual dosage range studied in clinical trials was 180 mg to 480 mg once daily.
 Current clinical experience with the 540 mg dose is limited; the dose may be increased to 540 mg with little or no increased risk of adverse reactions.
 Doses should not exceed 540 mg once daily.
 Angina: Dosages for the treatment of angina should be adjusted to each patient's needs, starting with a dose of 120 mg once daily, which may be titrated to doses of up to 480 mg once daily.
 When necessary, titration may be carried out over a 7 to 14 day period.
 Therefore, the dosage of diltiazem hydrochloride or the concomitant antihypertensives may need to be adjusted when adding one to the other.
 Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults.
 In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 - 3 mg / kg / min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower.
 A loading dose of parenteral Dilantin should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 - 3 mg / kg / min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients.
 For infusion administration, parenteral Dilantin should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of Dilantin in the solution no less than 5 mg / mL.
 In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg / kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70 - kg patient).
 The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 - 8 hours.
 The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 - 3 mg / kg / min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower.
 In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg / kg should be administered slowly.
 The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 - 3 mg / kg / min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients.
 Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route.
 The rate of administration for IV Dilantin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 - 3 mg / kg / min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients.
 Pediatric: A loading dose of 15 - 20 mg / kg of Dilantin intravenously will usually produce plasma concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted therapeutic range (10 - 20 mcg / mL).
 The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 - 3 mg / kg / min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower.
 In some cases serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments—the clinically effective serum level is usually 10 – 20 mcg / mL.
 Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one teaspoonful (5 mL) of Dilantin - 125 Suspension three times daily, and the dose is then adjusted to suit individual requirements.
 Initially, 5 mg / kg / day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily.
 A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg / kg.
 Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dose (300 mg / day).
 In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments—the clinically effective serum level is usually 10 – 20 mcg / mL.

 Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one 100 - mg Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsule, USP) three times daily and the dosage then adjusted to suit individual requirements.
 For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day.
 In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 - mg Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) daily, once - a - day dosage with 300 mg of Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) may be considered.
 Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak plasma levels, biologic half - life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent.
 Initially, one gram of Dilantin (extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP) is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two - hour intervals.
 Initially, 5 mg / kg / day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily.
 A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg / kg.
 Children over 6 years old and adolescents may require the minimum adult dose (300 mg / day).
 As noted under Clinical Pharmacology, only one trial has ever studied the use of extended - release isosorbide dinitrate for more than one dose.
 In that trial, 40 mg of dilatrate® - SR was administered twice daily in doses given 6 hours apart.
 In clinical trials, immediate - release oral isosorbide dinitrate has been administered in a variety of regimens, with total daily doses ranging from 30 to 480 mg.
 Do not exceed 160 mg (4 capsules) per day.
 The usual starting dose of DILAUDID INJECTION is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary.
 The initial starting dose is 0.2 to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours.

 The recommended starting dose of Diovan (valsartan) is 80 mg or 160 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume - depleted.
 Diovan may be used over a dose range of 80 mg to 320 mg daily, administered once a day.
 If additional antihypertensive effect is required over the starting dose range, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 320 mg or a diuretic may be added.
 Addition of a diuretic has a greater effect than dose increases beyond 80 mg.
 For children who can swallow tablets, the usual recommended starting dose is 1.3 mg / kg once daily (up to 40 mg total).
 Doses higher than 2.7 mg / kg (up to 160 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years old.
 Add 80 mL of Ora - Plus®* oral suspending vehicle to an amber glass bottle containing 8 Diovan 80 mg tablets, and shake for a minimum of 2 minutes.
 Add 80 mL of Ora - Sweet SF®* oral sweetening vehicle to the bottle and shake the suspension for at least 10 seconds to disperse the ingredients.
 The recommended starting dose of Diovan is 40 mg twice daily.
 Uptitration to 80 mg and 160 mg twice daily should be done to the highest dose, as tolerated by the patient.
 The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials is 320 mg in divided doses.
 The recommended starting dose of Diovan is 20 mg twice daily.
 Patients may be uptitrated within 7 days to 40 mg twice daily, with subsequent titrations to a target maintenance dose of 160 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient.
 The usual starting dose is Diovan HCT 160 / 12.5 mg once daily.
 The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 320 / 25 tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies].
 The clinical response to Diovan HCT should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 320 / 25 mg.
 The usual dosage in adults for maintenance of remission is 1.0 g / day in two divided doses.
 An adequate interval (3 to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects.
 Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and / or by increasing the infusion rate of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion.
 Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg / kg / min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times.
 Morphine premedication (0.15 mg / kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non - narcotic (lorazepam) premedication.
 Most adult patients under 55 years of age and classified as ASA - PS I or II require 2 to 2.5 mg / kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids.
 For induction, DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10 seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia.
 Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 to 1.5 mg / kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses.
 Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA - PS I or II require 2.5 to 3.5 mg / kg of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids.
 Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10 seconds.
 Slower boluses or infusions of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 to 2 mg / kg) (see PRECAUTIONS).
 Morphine premedication (0.15 mg / kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non - narcotic (lorazepam) premedication.
 A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 to 1.5 mg / kg) should be used.
 DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 100 to 200 mcg / kg / min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery.
 During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 to 200 mcg / kg / min) for the first 10 to 15 minutes.
 Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg / kg / min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times.
 Increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adult patients undergoing general surgery.
 In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at a rate of 200 to 300 mcg / kg / min should immediately follow the induction dose.
 Following the first half - hour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 to 150 mcg / kg / min are typically needed.
 In most patients, the rates of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration will be in the range of 25 to 75 mcg / kg / min.
 In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA - PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS).
 With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion at 100 to 150 mcg / kg / min (6 to 9 mg / kg / h) for a period of 3 to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function.
 With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg / kg administered over 3 to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses.
 In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA - PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS).
 With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 to 75 mcg / kg / min (1.5 to 4.5 mg / kg / h) during the first 10 to 15 minutes of sedation maintenance.
 Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 to 50 mcg / kg / min and adjusted to clinical responses.
 If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect.
 In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA - PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see WARNINGS).
 Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg / kg / min (0.3 to 3 mg / kg / h) individualized and titrated to clinical response.
 With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg / kg / min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation.
 When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg / kg / min (0.3 mg / kg / h).
 The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 to 10 mcg / kg / min (0.3 to 0.6 mg / kg / h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved.
 Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg / kg / min (0.3 to 3 mg / kg / h) or higher.
 Bolus administration of 10 or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur.
 If lidocaine is to be administered to minimize pain on injection of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion, it is recommended that it be administered prior to DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion administration or that it be added to DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion immediately before administration and in quantities not exceeding 20 mg lidocaine / 200 mg DIPRIVAN.
 DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion should only be administered through a filter with a pore size of 5 micron or greater unless it has been demonstrated that the filter does not restrict the flow of DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion and / or cause the breakdown of the emulsion.

 Patients who are dosed initially at 100 mg / m² and who experience either febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³for more than 1 week, or severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions during DOCEFREZ therapy should have the dosage adjusted from 100 mg / m² to 75 mg / m² .
 If the patient continues to experience these reactions, the dosage should either be decreased from 75 mg / m² to 55 mg / m² or the treatment should be discontinued.
 Conversely, patients who are dosed initially at 60 mg / m² and who do not experience febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³for more than 1 week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions, or severe peripheral neuropathy during DOCEFREZ therapy may tolerate higher doses.
 Patients who are dosed initially at 75 mg / m² and who experience either febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions, or other grade 3 / 4 nonhematological toxicities during DOCEFREZ treatment should have treatment withheld until resolution of the toxicity and then resumed at 55 mg / m² .
 For patients who are dosed initially at DOCEFREZ 75 mg / m² in combination with cisplatin, and whose nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells / mm³ , in patients who experience febrile neutropenia, and in patients with serious non - hematologic toxicities, the DOCEFREZ dosage in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg / m².
 In patients who require a further dose reduction, a dose of 50 mg / m² is recommended.
 DOCEFREZ should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells / mm³ .
 Patients who experience either febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or moderate neurosensory signs and / or symptoms during DOCEFREZ therapy should have the dosage of DOCEFREZ reduced from 75 mg / m² to 60 mg / m².
 The table below provides the fill range of the Diluent, the volume of Diluent to be added for the reconstitution and the concentration of the reconstituted solution for DOCEFREZ 20 mg and DOCEFREZ 80 mg (See Table 1).
 For mild to moderate pain, an initial dose of 1000 mg followed by 500 mg every 12 hours is recommended for most patients.
 Following the initial dose, some patients may require 500 mg every 8 hours.
 A lower dosage may be appropriate depending on such factors as pain severity, patient response, weight, or advanced age; for example, 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 8 - 12 hours.
 For osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, the suggested dosage range is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily in two divided doses.
 Maintenance doses higher than 1500 mg a day are not recommended.
 Use of DOLOPHINE as the First Opioid Analgesic: Initiate treatment with DOLOPHINE with 2.5 mg orally every 8 to 12 hours.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to DOLOPHINE:
 Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid (in this case, Morphine Extended Release Tablets 50 mg twice daily)
 50 mg Morphine Extended Release Tablets 2 times daily = 100 mg total daily dose of Morphine
 100 mg total daily dose of Morphine x 15% (10% to 20% per Table 1) = 15 mg DOLOPHINE daily
 15 mg daily / 2 = 7.5 mg DOLOPHINE every 12 hours
 Then 7.5 mg is rounded down to 5 mg DOLOPHINE every 12 hours
 Conversion from Parenteral Methadone to DOLOPHINE: Use a conversion ratio of 1:2 mg for parenteral to oral methadone (e.g., 5 mg parenteral methadone to 10 mg oral methadone).
 An initial single dose of 20 to 30 mg of DOLOPHINE will often be sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms.
 The initial dose should not exceed 30 mg.
 Provide an additional 5 to 10 mg of DOLOPHINE if withdrawal symptoms have not been suppressed or if symptoms reappear.
 The total daily dose of DOLOPHINE on the first day of treatment should not ordinarily exceed 40 mg.
 Short - term Detoxification: For a brief course of stabilization followed by a period of medically supervised withdrawal, titrate the patient to a total daily dose of about 40 mg in divided doses to achieve an adequate stabilizing level.
 Most commonly, clinical stability is achieved at doses between 80 to 120 mg / day.
 There is considerable variability in the appropriate rate of methadone taper in patients choosing medically supervised withdrawal from methadone treatment.
 Dose reductions should generally be less than 10% of the established tolerance or maintenance dose, and 10 to 14 - day intervals should elapse between dose reductions.
 The usual dose is one tablet every twelve (12) hours.
 If indicated, one tablet every eight (8) hours may be given.

 The recommended dose of Duagen (dutasteride) is 1 capsule (0.5 mg) taken orally once a day.
 The recommended dosage is one DUAVEE tablet daily.
 The recommended dosage is one DUAVEE tablet daily.
 They should not take two doses at the same time.
 DUETACT tablets are available as a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 2 mg glimepiride or a 30 mg pioglitazone plus 4 mg glimepiride tablet.
 Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.
 If gemfibrozil or other CYP2C8 inhibitors need to coadministered, patients should switch to individual components of DUETACT because the minimum dose of pioglitazone in DUETACT exceeds 15 mg [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended daily dose of DUEXIS (ibuprofen and famotidine) 800 mg / 26.6 mg is a single tablet administered orally three times per day.
 Patients should be instructed not to take 2 doses at one time to make up for a missed dose.
 DULERA should be administered as two inhalations twice daily every day (morning and evening) by the orally inhaled route.
 The maximum daily recommended dose is two inhalations of DULERA 200 mcg / 5 mcg twice daily.
 Do not use more than two inhalations twice daily of the prescribed strength of DULERA as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of formoterol.
 Three (3) DuoDote Auto - Injectors should be available for use in each patient (including emergency medical services personnel) at risk for organophosphorous poisoning; one (1) for mild symptoms plus two (2) more for severe symptoms as described below.
 Each DuoDote Auto - Injector delivers atropine 2.1 mg plus pralidoxime chloride 600 mg.
 First Dose: In the situation of known or suspected organophosphorous poisoning, administer one (1) DuoDote injection into the mid - lateral thigh if the patient experiences two or more MILD symptoms of nerve gas or insecticide exposure.
 Emergency medical services personnel with mild symptoms may self - administer a single dose of DuoDote.
 Wait 10 to 15 minutes for DuoDote to take effect.
 Additional Doses: If, at any time after the first dose, the patient develops any of the SEVERE symptoms listed above, administer two (2) additional DuoDote injections in rapid succession, and immediately seek definitive medical care.
 The recommended dose of DuoNeb (ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate) is one 3 mL vial administered 4 times per day via nebulization with up to 2 additional 3 mL doses allowed per day, if needed.
 The maximum recommended daily dose of DUOPA is 2000 mg of the levodopa component (i.e., one cassette per day) administered over 16 hours.
 The extra dose function should be set at 1 mL (20 mg of levodopa) when starting DUOPA.
 If the amount of the extra dose needs to be adjusted, it is typically done in 0.2 mL increments.
 The extra dose frequency should be limited to one extra dose every 2 hours.
 Prior to initiating DUOPA, convert patients from all other forms of levodopa to oral immediaterelease carbidopa - levodopa tablets (1:4 ratio).
 Step 1: Calculate and administer the DUOPA Morning Dose for Day 1
 Step 2: Calculate and administer the DUOPA Continuous Dose for Day 1
 If there was an inadequate clinical response within 1 hour of the Morning Dose on the preceding day, adjust the Morning Dose (excluding the 3 mL to fill the tube) as follows:
 If the patient experienced dyskinesias or DUOPA - related adverse reactions within 1 hour of the Morning Dose on the preceding day, decrease the Morning Dose by 1 mL.
 DUOPA is dispensed from medication cassette reservoirs that are specifically designed to be connected to the CADD® - Legacy 1400 pump.
 See Table 1 for the recommended tubing sets for PEG - J administration.
 The recommended starting dose of Duraclon for continuous epidural infusion is 30 mcg / hr.
 Although dosage may be titrated up or down depending on pain relief and occurrence of adverse events, experience with dosage rates above 40 mcg / hr is limited.
 The 500 mcg / mL (0.5 mg / mL) strength product must be diluted prior to use in 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, U.S.P., to a final concentration of 100 mcg / mL:
 Patients considered opioid - tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg of morphine daily, or at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, or at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.
 As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patient's 24 - hour fentanyl requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate - release opioid) than to overestimate the 24 - hour fentanyl requirements which could result in adverse reactions.
 Do not use Table 1 to convert from DURAGESIC to other therapies because this conversion to DURAGESIC is conservative and will overestimate the dose of the new agent.
 In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, start with one half of the usual dosage of DURAGESIC.
 In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, start with one half of the usual dosage of DURAGESIC.
 Do not use Tables 1 and 2 to convert from DURAGESIC to other therapies to avoid overestimating the dose of the new agent resulting in overdose of the new analgesic and possibly death.
 The initial dose of morphine should be 2 mg to 10 mg / 70 kg of body weight.
 Acceptable techniques for verifying proper placement include: a) aspiration to check for absence of blood or cerebrospinal fluid, or b) administration of 5 mL (3 mL in obstetric patients) of 1.5% PRESERVATIVE - FREE Lidocaine and Epinephrine (1:200,000) Injection and then observe the patient for lack of tachycardia (this indicates that vascular injection has not been made) and lack of sudden onset of segmental anesthesia (this indicates that intrathecal injection has not been made).
 Initial injection of 5 mg in the lumbar region may provide satisfactory pain relief for up to 24 hours.
 If adequate pain relief is not achieved within one hour, careful administration of incremental doses of 1 to 2 mg at intervals sufficient to assess effectiveness may be given.
 Thoracic administration has been shown to dramatically increase the incidence of early and late respiratory depression even at doses of 1 to 2 mg.
 A single injection of 0.2 to 1 mg may provide satisfactory pain relief for up to 24 hours.
 (CAUTION: THIS IS ONLY 0.4 TO 2 ML OF THE 5 MG / 10 ML AMPUL OR 0.2 TO 1 ML OF THE 10 MG / 10 ML AMPUL OF DURAMORPH (morphine injection) ).
 DO NOT INJECT INTRATHECALLY MORE THAN 2 ML OF THE 5 MG / 10 ML AMPUL OR 1 ML OF THE 10 MG / 10 ML AMPUL.
 A constant intravenous infusion of naloxone, 0.6 mg / hr, for 24 hours after intrathecal injection may be used to reduce the incidence of potential side effects.
 The maximum dose to be employed as a single injection should be determined on the basis of the status of the patient and the type of regional anesthetic technique to be performed.
 Although single injections of 450 mg have been employed for regional anesthesia without adverse effects, at present it is strongly recommended that the maximal dose as a single injection should not exceed 400 mg (approximately 8.0 mg / kg or 3.6 mg / lb based on a 50 kg person) with epinephrine 1:200,000 and 300 mg (approximately 6 mg / kg or 2.7 mg / lb based on a 50 kg person) without epinephrine.
 As a precaution against the adverse experiences sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose of 2 - 5 mL should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block.
 Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10 - 15 mg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection.
 In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation, and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter.
 In maxillary infiftration and / or inferior alveolar nerve block, initial dosages of 1.0 - 5.0 mL (½ - 2 ½ cartridges) of Duranest (etidocaine hcl) Injection 1.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 are usually effective.
 Instill one drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye 4 times daily beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing throughout the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period, followed by 2 times daily for a week and then a taper based on the response.
 Instill one drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye 4 times daily for 14 days followed by tapering as clinically indicated.
 Urinary Tract Infections: For uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (i.e., cystitis) the usual dosage is 1 or 2 g per day in a single (q.d.)

 In adults, the initial dose is 1000 mg of DURICEF (cefadroxil) and the maintenance dose (based on the creatinine clearance rate [mL / min / 1.73 M2]) is 500 mg at the time intervals listed below.
 The recommended dose of DURLAZA is one capsule (162.5 mg) once daily.
 The recommended starting dose of DUTOPROL (metoprolol succinate extended release and hydrochlorothiazide) is 25 mg / 12.5 mg taken orally once daily with or without food.
 Depending on the blood pressure response, the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2 weeks to a maximum recommended dose of 200 mg / 25 mg (two DUTOPROL 100 mg / 12.5 mg tablets) once daily [see Clinical Studies].
 DUTREBIS is a fixed - dose combination product containing 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of raltegravir.
 The recommended dosage of DUTREBIS in adults, adolescents (16 years of age and older), and pediatric patients (6 through 16 years of age and weighing at least 30 kg) is one tablet taken twice daily orally with or without food.
 The maximum dose of DUTREBIS is one tablet (150 mg lamivudine / 300 mg raltegravir) taken twice daily.
 DUTREBIS is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 50 mL / min.
 If creatinine clearance decreases to < 50 mL / min, DUTREBIS should be switched to the individual components (lamivudine and raltegravir) to allow for lamivudine dose reduction.
 In children 6 years of age and older, start with 2.5 mg or 5 mg once daily in the morning.
 The dose may be increased in increments of 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day every 4 to 7 days up to a maximum dose of 20 mg per day.
 The usual dose of DYAZIDE (hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene) is one or two capsules given once daily, with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium and of the clinical effect (see WARNINGS, Hyperkalemia).
 Do not exceed 150 mg total daily dose.
 For the treatment of acute pain, the recommended dose of DYLOJECT is 37.5 mg administered by intravenous bolus injection over 15 seconds every 6 hours as needed, Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.

 The recommended initial dose of DynaCirc® (isradipine) is 2.5 mg b.i.d.
 If a satisfactory reduction in blood pressure does not occur after this period, the dose may be adjusted in increments of 5 mg / day at 2 - 4 week intervals up to a maximum of 20 mg / day.
 Most patients, however, show no additional response to doses above 10 mg / day, and adverse effects are increased in frequency above 10 mg / day.
 Ordinarily, the starting dose should still be 2.5 mg b.i.d.
 The dosage of DynaCirc CR® (isradipine) Controlled Release Tablets should be individualized.The recommended initial dose of DynaCirc CR® (isradipine) is 5 mg once - daily as monotherapy or in combination with a thiazide diuretic.
 An antihypertensive response usually occurs within 2 hours,with the peak antihypertensive response occurring 8 - 10hours post - dose; blood pressure reduction is maintained for at least 24 hours following drug administration.If necessary,the dose may be adjusted in increments of 5 mg at 2 - 4 week intervals up to a maximum dose of 20 mg / day.
 Adverse experiences are increased in frequency above 10 mg / day.
 Ordinarily, a starting dose of DynaCirc CR® (isradipine) 5 mg once - daily should be used in these patients.
 When used alone, the usual starting dose is 100 mg twice daily after meals.
 The total daily dosage should not exceed 300 mg.
 Table 1: Dilution Instructions for DYSPORT® Vials (500 Units and 300 Units)
 After reconstitution, DYSPORT® should be used for only one injection session and for only one patient.
 The recommended initial dose of DYSPORT® for the treatment of cervical dystonia is 500 Units given intramuscularly as a divided dose among affected muscles in patients with or without a history of prior treatment with botulinum toxin.
 Uncontrolled open - label studies also suggest that the total dose administered in a single treatment should be between 250 Units and 1000 Units.
 Doses above 1000 Units have not been systematically evaluated.
 The starting dose of 500 Units recommended for cervical dystonia is applicable to adults of all ages [see Use in Specific Populations].

 The dose of DYSPORT® for the treatment of glabellar lines is a total of 50 Units given intramuscularly in five equal aliquots of 10 Units each to achieve clinical effect (see Figure 1).
 A total dose of 50 Units of DYSPORT®, in five equal aliquots, should be administered to achieve clinical effect.
 Each 300 Unit vial of DYSPORT® is to be reconstituted with 2.5 mL of preservative - free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP prior to injection.
 The concentration of the resulting solution will be 10 Units per 0.08 mL (12 Units per 0.1 mL) to be delivered in five equally divided aliquots of 0.08 mL each.
 DYSPORT® may also be reconstituted with 1.5 mL of preservative - free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP for a solution of 10 Units per 0.05 mL (20 Units per 0.1 mL) to be delivered in five equally divided aliquots of 0.05 mL each.
 Using an appropriately sized sterile syringe, needle and aseptic technique, draw up 2.5 mL or 1.5 mL of preservative - free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP Insert the needle into the DYSPORT® vial.
 Draw a single patient dose of DYSPORT® into a sterile syringe.
 Inject patients with a total of 50 Units in five equally divided aliquots.
 Using a 30 gauge needle, inject 10 Units of DYSPORT® into each of five sites, two in each corrugator muscle, and one in the procerus muscle (see Figure 1).
 Figure 1
 In the pivotal clinical trial, doses of 500 Units and 1000 Units muscles, Table 2 and Figure 2, at a given treatment session.
 No more than 1 mL should generally be administered at any single injection site.
 The recommended concentration is 100 Units / mL or 200 Units / mL with preservative - free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP) (see Table 1).
 No more than 2.5 mL of saline should be introduced into the vial (see footnote in Table 1).
 The recommended dose of reconstituted E - Z - HD for adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older is between 65 and 135 mL given orally (155 to 321 grams of barium sulfate, respectively).
 Volumes closer to 65 mL are recommended for the examination of the esophagus and volumes up to 135 mL are recommended for examination of the entire upper GI tract.
 The recommended dose in adults is 80 mg taken orally once daily.
 Consider a starting dose of 40 mg for patients who are treated with high doses of diuretics.
 The recommended starting dose of Edarbyclor is 40 / 12.5 mg taken orally once daily.
 The dosage may be increased to 40 / 25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks as needed to achieve blood pressure goals.
 Edarbyclor doses above 40 / 25 mg are probably not useful.
 Patients not controlled with azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg may have an additional systolic / diastolic clinic blood pressure reduction of 13 / 6 mm Hg when switched to Edarbyclor 40 / 12.5 mg.
 Patients not controlled with chlorthalidone 25 mg may have an additional clinic blood pressure reduction of 10 / 7 mm Hg when switched to Edarbyclor 40 / 12.5 mg.
 EDECRIN is available for oral use as 25 mg tablets.
 The smallest dose required to produce gradual weight loss (about 1 to 2 pounds per day) is recommended.
 Onset of diuresis usually occurs at 50 to 100 mg for adults.
 After diuresis has been achieved, the minimally effective dose (usually from 50 to 200 mg daily) may be given on a continuous or intermittent dosage schedule.
 Dosage adjustments are usually in 25 to 50 mg increments to avoid derangement of water and electrolyte excretion.
 Day 1 — 50 mg once daily after a meal Day 2 — 50 mg twice daily after meals, if necessary Day 3 — 100 mg in the morning and 50 to 100 mg following the afternoon or evening meal, depending upon response to the morning dose.
 A few patients may require initial and maintenance doses as high as 200 mg twice daily.
 (excluding infants, see CONTRAINDICATIONS): The initial dose should be 25 mg.
 Careful stepwise increments in dosage of 25 mg should be made to achieve effective maintenance.
 Therefore, when adding EDECRIN the initial dose and changes of dose should be in 25 mg increments, to avoid electrolyte depletion.
 The usual intravenous dose for the average sized adult is 50 mg, or 0.5 to 1.0 mg per kg of body weight.
 Usually only one dose has been necessary; occasionally a second dose at a new injection site, to avoid possible thrombophlebitis, may be required.
 A single intravenous dose not exceeding 100 mg has been used in critical situations.
 To reconstitute the dry material, add 50 mL of 5 percent Dextrose Injection, or Sodium Chloride Injection to the vial.
 The dosage range of edex® (alprostadil for injection) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction is 1 to 40 mcg.
 The intracavernous injection should be given over a 5 to 10 second interval.
 In a study with a dose range of 1 to 20 mcg of edex® (alprostadil for injection) , the mean dose was 10.7 mcg at the end of the dose titration period.
 In two studies with a dose range of 1 to 40 mcg of edex® (alprostadil for injection) , the mean dose was 21.9 mcg at the end of the dose titration period.
 Doses greater than 40 mcg have not been studied.
 Erectile Dysfunction of Vasculogenic, Psychogenic, or Mixed Etiology: Dosage titration should be initiated at 2.5 micrograms of alprostadil.
 If there is a partial response, the dose may be increased by 2.5 micrograms to a dose of 5 micrograms and then in increments of 5 to 10 micrograms, depending upon erectile response, until the dose that produces an erection suitable for intercourse and not exceeding a duration of 1 hour is reached.
 If there is no response to the initial 2.5 - microgram dose, the second dose may be increased to 7.5 micrograms, followed by increments of 5 to 10 micrograms.
 Erectile Dysfunction of Pure Neurogenic Etiology (Spinal Cord Injury): Dosage titration should be initiated at 1.25 micrograms of alprostadil.
 The dose may be increased by 1.25 micrograms to a dose of 2.5 micrograms, followed by an increment of 2.5 micrograms to a dose of 5 micrograms, and then in 5 - microgram increments until the dose that produces an erection suitable for intercourse and not exceeding a duration of 1 hour is reached.
 The plunger is used to force the sterile 0.9% sodium chloride (1.075 mL) in one chamber into the chamber containing alprostadil.
 edex® (alprostadil for injection) is given as an intracavernous injection over a 5 to 10 second interval.
 The recommended initial dose is 5 mg for women and either 5 or 10 mg for men, taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7 - 8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening.
 If the 5 mg dose is not effective, the dose can be increased to 10 mg.
 In some patients, the higher morning blood levels following use of the 10 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The total dose of Edluar should not exceed 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime.
 The recommended dose of Edluar in both of these patient populations is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS; Use in Specific Populations].
 The recommended dose of EDURANT is one 25 mg tablet once daily taken orally with a meal [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 For patients concomitantly receiving rifabutin, the EDURANT dose should be increased to 50 mg (two tablets of 25 mg each) once daily, taken with a meal.
 When rifabutin co - administration is stopped, the EDURANT dose should be decreased to 25 mg once daily, taken with a meal [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Administration should be cyclic (e.g., three weeks on and one week off).
 1 tablet of ESTERIFIED ESTROGENS AND METHYLTESTOSTERONE FULL STRENGTH or 1 to 2 tablets of ESTERIFIED ESTROGENS AND METHYLTESTOSTERONE HALF STRENGTH daily as recommended by the physician.
 The recommended starting dose for venlafaxine tablets, USP is 75 mg / day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food.
 Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg / day.
 If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225 mg / day.
 When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg / day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days.
 In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg / day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mg / day.
 Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg / day, generally in three divided doses (see PRECAUTIONS, General, Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness).
 Given the decrease in clearance for venlafaxine and the increase in elimination half - life for both venlafaxine and ODV that is observed in patients with renal impairment (GFR = 10 to 70 mL / min) compared to normals (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), it is recommended that the total daily dose be reduced by 25% in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
 In one study, in which patients responding during 8 weeks of acute treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extendedrelease capsules were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended - release capsules (75, 150, or 225 mg / day, qAM) during 26 weeks of maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, longer - term efficacy was demonstrated.
 A second longer - term study has demonstrated the efficacy of venlafaxine tablets, USP in maintaining an antidepressant response in patients with recurrent depression who had responded and continued to be improved during an initial 26 weeks of treatment and were then randomly assigned to placebo or venlafaxine tablets, USP for periods of up to 52 weeks on the same dose (100 to 200 mg / day, on a b.i.d.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with venlafaxine tablets, USP is unclear.
 EFFEXOR XR should be administered in a single dose with food, either in the morning or in the evening at approximately the same time each day [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 For most patients, the recommended starting dose for EFFEXOR XR is 75 mg per day, administered in a single dose.
 For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 37.5 mg per day for 4 to 7 days to allow new patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 75 mg per day.
 Patients not responding to the initial 75 mg per day dose may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of 225 mg per day.
 Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 4 days, since steady - state plasma levels of venlafaxine and its major metabolites are achieved in most patients by day 4 [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 It should be noted that, while the maximum recommended dose for moderately depressed outpatients is also 225 mg per day for Effexor (immediate - release), more severely depressed inpatients in one study of the development program for that product responded to a mean dose of 350 mg per day (range of 150 to 375 mg per day).
 Whether or not higher doses of EFFEXOR XR are needed for more severely depressed patients is unknown; however, the experience with EFFEXOR XR doses higher than 225 mg per day is very limited.
 For most patients, the recommended starting dose for EFFEXOR XR is 75 mg per day, administered in a single dose.
 For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 37.5 mg per day for 4 to 7 days to allow new patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 75 mg per day.
 Patients not responding to the initial 75 mg per day dose may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of 225 mg per day.
 Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 4 days, since steady - state plasma levels of venlafaxine and its major metabolites are achieved in most patients by day 4 [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose is 75 mg per day, administered in a single dose.
 The recommended starting dose is 37.5 mg per day of EFFEXOR XR for 7 days.
 Patients not responding to 75 mg per day may benefit from dose increases to a maximum of approximately 225 mg per day.
 Dose increases should be in increments of up to 75 mg per day, as needed, and should be made at intervals of not less than 7 days.
 Depressed patients who are currently being treated at a therapeutic dose with Effexor (immediate release) may be switched to EFFEXOR XR at the nearest equivalent dose (mg per day), e.g., 37.5 mg venlafaxine twice a day to 75 mg EFFEXOR XR once daily.
 In patients undergoing hemodialysis or with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL / min), the total daily dose should be reduced by 50% or more.
 In clinical studies with EFFEXOR XR, tapering was achieved by reducing the daily dose by 75 mg at one - week intervals.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg concomitantly with EFFEXOR XR is unclear.
 Initiate Effient treatment as a single 60 - mg oral loading dose and then continue at 10 - mg orally once daily.
 Patients taking Effient should also take aspirin (75 - mg to 325 - mg) daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of EGRIFTA™ is 2 mg injected subcutaneously once a day.
 Reconstitute the 2 mg vial of EGRIFTA™ with 2.1 mL of diluent.
 The recommended dosage regimen of ELAPRASE is 0.5 mg per kg of body weight administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion.
 Administer the diluted ELAPRASE solution to patients using a low - protein - binding infusion set equipped with a low - protein - binding 0.2 micrometer (μm) in - line filter.
 The initial infusion rate should be 8 mL per hour for the first 15 minutes.
 If the infusion is well tolerated, the rate of infusion may be increased by 8 mL per hour increments every 15 minutes.
 The infusion rate should not exceed 100 mL per hour.
 For outpatients 75 mg of amitriptyline HCl a day in divided doses is usually satisfactory.
 If necessary, this may be increased to a total of 150 mg per day.
 An alternate method of initiating therapy in outpatients is to begin with 50 to 100 mg amitriptyline HCl at bedtime.
 This may be increased by 25 or 50 mg as necessary in the bedtime dose to a total of 150 mg per day.
 Hospitalized patients may require 100 mg a day initially.
 This can be increased gradually to 200 mg a day if necessary.
 A small number of hospitalized patients may need as much as 300 mg a day.
 Ten mg 3 times a day with 20 mg at bedtime may be satisfactory in adolescent and elderly patients who do not tolerate higher dosages.
 The usual maintenance dosage of amitriptyline HCl is 50 to 100 mg per day.
 In some patients 40 mg per day is sufficient.
 The recommended regimen for the administration of ELDEPRYL (selegiline hcl) is 10 mg per day administered as divided doses of 5 mg each taken at breakfast and lunch.
 A reduction of 10 to 30% was achieved with the typical participant in the domestic placebo controlled trials who was assigned to selegiline treatment.
 Treatment - naïve patients: The recommended dosage of ELELYSO for long - term treatment is 60 units / kg of body weight administered every other week as a 60 to 120 minute intravenous infusion.
 Administer ELELYSO for long - term treatment every other week as a 60 to 120 minute intravenous infusion.
 Each vial of ELELYSO provides 200 units of taliglucerase alfa and is intended for single use only.
 ELELYSO should be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection and diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final volume of 100 mL to 200 mL, and delivered by intravenous infusion.
 If immediate use is not possible, the reconstituted product may be stored for up to 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F) under protection from light or up to 4 hours at 20 to 25 °C (68 to 77 °F) without protection from light.
 The diluted product may be stored for up to 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F) under protection from light.
 Treatment should be initiated with a dose of 1,000 mg once daily.
 The once daily dosage may be adjusted in increments of 1,000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended once daily dose of 3,000 mg.
 The recommended dosage is one drop in each eye twice a day.
 The recommended area of application is the upper arm to shoulder (approximately 320 cm²).
 ELESTRIN is applied once daily to the upper arm for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause using a metered - dose pump which delivers 0.87 gram of estradiol gel (0.52 mg estradiol) per actuation (1 pump).
 Patients should be started with the lowest effective dose of ELESTRIN, which is one pump per day (0.87 g per day, which contains 0.52 mg of estradiol).

 Usually 30 grams is sufficient for an average adult.
 The recommended dose of ELIQUIS for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.
 The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:
 The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily.
 The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy.
 After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.
 The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies].
 One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.
 For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P - glycoprotein (P - gp) (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P - gp [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, 5 mg and 2.5 mg ELIQUIS tablets may be crushed and suspended in water, 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or apple juice, or mixed with applesauce and promptly administered orally [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Alternatively, ELIQUIS tablets may be crushed and suspended in 60 mL of water or D5W and promptly delivered through a nasogastric tube [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of Elitek is 0.2 mg / kg as a 30 minute intravenous infusion daily for up to 5 days.
 For example, at a dose of 900 mg / d in adults < 60 years or 22 mg / kg / d in children 1 - 9 years, the steady state peak serum theophylline concentration will be < 10 mcg / mL in about 30% of patients, 10 - 20 mcg / mL in about 50% and 20 - 30 mcg / mL in about 20% of patients.
 If a serum theophylline concentration is obtained before steady state is achieved, the maintenance dose should not be increased, even if the serum theophylline concentration is < 10 mcg / mL.
 In children 1 - 15 years of age, the final theophylline dose should not exceed 16 mg / kg / day up to a maximum of 400 mg / day in the presence of risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.
 In adolescents ≥ 16 years and adults, including the elderly, the final theophylline dose should not exceed 400 mg / day in the presence of risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.
 A single 5 mg / kg dose of theophylline, in a patient who has not received any theophylline in the previous 24 hours, will produce an average peak serum theophylline concentration of 10 mcg / mL (range 5 - 15 mcg / mL).
 Instruct patients to take one tablet orally as soon as possible within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure.
 The recommended dose of ELLENCE is 100 to 120 mg / m².
 ELLENCE dosage adjustments for hematologic and non - hematologic toxicities within a cycle of treatment, is based on nadir platelet counts < 50,000 / mm³, absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) < 250 / mm³, neutropenic fever, or Grades 3 / 4 nonhematologic toxicity.
 Reduce ELLENCE Day 1 dose in subsequent cycles to 75% of the Day 1 dose given in the current cycle.
 For patients receiving a divided dose of ELLENCE (Day 1 and Day 8), the Day 8 dose should be 75% of Day 1 if platelet counts are 75,000 - 100,000 / mm³ and ANC is 1000 to 1499 / mm³.
 While no specific dose recommendation can be made based on the limited available data in patients with renal impairment, consider lower doses in patients with severe renal impairment (serum creatinine > 5 mg / dL) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 This gelled product will return to a slightly viscous to mobile solution after 2 to a maximum of 4 hours equilibration at controlled room temperature (15 - 25°C).
 The recommended dose of ELMIRON® is 300 mg / day taken as one 100 mg capsule orally three times daily.
 Estimated Increment of Factor VIII (IU / dL or % of normal) = [Total Dose (IU) / body weight (kg)] x 2 (IU / dL per IU / kg)
 Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x Desired Factor VIII Rise (IU / dL or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU / kg per IU / dL)

 Figure 1
 For patients who experience persistent Grade 2 neurosensory events that do not resolve, a dose reduction of ELOXATIN to 75 mg / m² should be considered.
 A dose reduction of ELOXATIN to 75 mg / m² and infusional 5 - fluorouracil to 300 mg / m² bolus and 500 mg / m² 22 hour infusion is recommended for patients after recovery from grade 3 / 4 gastrointestinal (despite prophylactic treatment), or grade 4 neutropenia, or febrile neutropenia, or grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia.
 For patients who experience persistent Grade 2 neurosensory events that do not resolve, a dose reduction of ELOXATIN to 65 mg / m² should be considered.
 A dose reduction of ELOXATIN to 65 mg / m² and 5 - fluorouracil by 20% (300 mg / m² bolus and 500 mg / m² 22 - hour infusion) is recommended for patients after recovery from grade 3 / 4 gastrointestinal (despite prophylactic treatment), or grade 4 neutropenia, or febrile neutropenia, or grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia.
 In patients with normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment, the recommended dose of ELOXATIN is 85 mg / m².
 In patients with severe renal impairment, the initial recommended ELOXATIN dose should be reduced to 65 mg / m² [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of Elspar is 6,000 International Units / m² intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV) three times a week.
 W hen Elspar is administered IM, the volume at a single injection site should be limited to 2 mL.
 If a volume greater than 2 mL is to be administered, two injection sites should be used.
 For IM administration, reconstitute Elspar by adding 2 mL Sodium Chloride Injection to the 10,000 unit vial.
 The reconstituted solution contains 5,000 international units (IU) / mL.
 For IV administration, reconstitute Elspar by adding 5 mL Sterile W ater for Injection or Sodium Chloride Injection to the 10,000 unit vial.
 The reconstituted solution contains 2,000 IU / mL.
 The recommended dose is one drop in the effected eye up to four times daily.
 EMBEDA 100 mg / 4 mg capsules are only for patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency is established.
 Patients considered opioid - tolerant are those taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of morphine daily, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Initiate treatment with EMBEDA with 20 mg / 0.8 mg capsule orally every 24 hours.
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is EMBEDA 20 mg / 0.8 mg orally every 24 hours.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Discontinue all other around - the - clock opioid drugs when EMBEDA therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using EMBEDA 30 mg orally every 24 hours.
 Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio: Between 2 mg and 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine.
 Typically, a dose of oral morphine that is three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement is sufficient.
 The recommended daily dose is 14 mg per kg of body weight (ie, one 140 mg capsule for each 10 kg or 22 lb of body weight), given in 3 or 4 divided doses.
 Most patients in studies in the United States have been treated at a dosage range of 10 to 16 mg per kg per day.
 Some patients have been maintained on therapy for more than 3 years at doses ranging from 10 to 16 mg per kg of body weight per day.
 The recommended oral dosage of EMEND capsules, dexamethasone, and a 5 - HT3 antagonist in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who can swallow oral capsules, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with administration of HEC or MEC is shown in Table 1 or Table 2, respectively.
 Dosing of EMEND for oral suspension is based on weight, to a maximum of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg on Days 2 and 3.
 The recommended oral dosage of EMEND capsules in adults is 40 mg within 3 hours prior to induction of anesthesia.
 EMEND for oral suspension is packaged as a kit with one 1 mL oral dosing dispenser, one 5 mL oral dosing dispenser, one cap and one mixing cup.
 Fill the 5 mL oral dosing dispenser with 4.6 mL of water from the mixing cup.
 Add the 4.6 mL of water from the dispenser back into the mixing cup.
 Each pouch of EMEND for oral suspension contains 125 mg of aprepitant which is to be suspended in 4.6 mL of water giving a final concentration of 25 mg / mL.
 Pour the entire contents of the pouch into the 4.6 mL of water in the mixing cup and snap the lid shut.
 If the dose is less than 1 mL round to the nearest 0.1 mL.
 If the dose is more than 1 mL round to the nearest 0.2 mL.
 The recommended dosage of EMEND for injection, dexamethasone, and a 5 - HT 3 antagonist in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with administration of HEC or MEC is shown in Table 1 or Table 2, respectively.
 Give one third of the recommended dosage when EMFLAZA is administered with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
 For example, a 36 mg per day dose would be reduced to a 12 mg per day dose when used with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Minor Dermal Procedures: For minor procedures such as intravenous cannulation and venipuncture, apply 2.5 grams of EMLA (lidocaine and prilocaine) Cream (1 / 2 the 5 g tube) over 20 to 25 cm2 of skin surface for at least 1 hour.
 Major Dermal Procedures: For more painful dermatological procedures involving a larger skin area such as split thickness skin graft harvesting, apply 2 grams of EMLA (lidocaine and prilocaine) Cream per 10 cm2 of skin and allow to remain in contact with the skin for at least 2 hours.
 To measure 1 gram of EMLA (lidocaine and prilocaine) , the Cream should be gently squeezed out of the tube as a narrow strip that is 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long and 0.2 inches (5 mm) wide.
 1 gram = 1 strip 2 grams = 2 strips 2.5 grams = 2.5 strips
 The recommended dosage of EMPLICITI is 10 mg / kg administered intravenously every week for the first two cycles and every 2 weeks thereafter in conjunction with the recommended dosing of lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone as described below.
 If the dose of one drug in the regimen is delayed, interrupted, or discontinued, the treatment with the other drugs may continue as scheduled.
 If a Grade 2 or higher infusion reaction occurs during EMPLICITI administration, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical and supportive measures.
 Upon resolution to Grade 1 or lower, restart EMPLICITI at 0.5 mL per minute and gradually increase at a rate of 0.5 mL per minute every 30 minutes as tolerated to the rate at which the infusion reaction occurred.
 Initiate EMPLICITI infusion at a rate of 0.5 mL per minute.
 The maximum infusion rate should not exceed 2 mL per minute.
 Adjust the infusion rate following a Grade 2 or higher infusion reaction [see Dose Modifications].
 In patients who have received 4 cycles of EMPLICITI treatment, the infusion rate may be increased to a maximum of 5 mL / min.
 If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored under refrigeration conditions: 2®C to 8®C (36®F - 46®F) and protected from light for up to 24 hours (a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours can be at room temperature, 20°C to 25°C [68°F­77°F], and room light).
 EMSAM (selegiline transdermal system)should be applied to dry,intact skin on the upper torso (below the neck and above the waist), upper thigh or the outer surface of the upper arm once every 24 hours.The recommended starting dose and target dose for EMSAM (selegiline transdermal system) is 6 mg / 24 hours.
 However, the trials were not designed to assess if higher doses are more effective than the lowest effective dose of 6 mg / 24 hours.Based on clinical judgment,if dose increases are indicated for individual patients,they should occur in dose increments of 3 mg / 24 hours (up to a maximum dose of 12 mg / 24 hours) at intervals of no less than 2 weeks.
 Patients should be informed that tyramine - rich foods and beverages should be avoided beginning on the first day of EMSAM (selegiline transdermal system) 9 mg / 24 hours or 12 mg / 24 hours treatment and should continue to be avoided for 2 weeks after a dose reduction to EMSAM (selegiline transdermal system) 6 mg / 24 hours or following the discontinuation of EMSAM 9 mg / 24 hours or 12 mg / 24 hours (see WARNINGS).
 Therefore, the dosing interval or dose of EMTRIVA should be adjusted in patients with baseline creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min using the following guidelines (see Table 1).
 The recommended starting dose of Enablex is 7.5 mg once daily.
 Based upon individual response, the dose may be increased to 15 mg once daily, as early as two weeks after starting therapy.

 The dose in hypertension is 1.25 mg every six hours administered intravenously over a five minute period.
 No dosage regimen for enalaprilat injection has been clearly demonstrated to be more effective in treating hypertension than 1.25 mg every six hours.
 However, in controlled clinical studies in hypertension, doses as high as 5 mg every six hours were well tolerated for up to 36 hours.
 There has been inadequate experience with doses greater than 20 mg per day.
 The dose for patients being converted to enalaprilat injection from oral therapy for hypertension with enalapril maleate is 1.25 mg every six hours.
 For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy, the recommended initial dose of oral enalapril maleate is 5 mg once a day with subsequent dosage adjustments as necessary.
 For patients on diuretic therapy the recommended starting dose for hypertension is 0.625 mg administered intravenously over a five minute period; also see below, Patients at Risk of Excessive Hypotension.A clinical response is usually seen within 15 minutes.
 If after one hour there is an inadequate clinical response, the 0.625 mg dose may be repeated.
 Additional doses of 1.25 mg may be administered at six hour intervals.
 For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy, the recommended initial dose of oral enalapril maleate for patients who have responded to 0.625 mg of enalaprilat injection every six hours is 2.5 mg once a day with subsequent dosage adjustment as necessary.
 The usual dose of 1.25 mg of enalaprilat injection every six hours is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance > 30 mL / min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg / dL).
 For patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL / min (serum creatinine ≥ 3 mg / dL), the initial dose is 0.625 mg. (See WARNINGS.)
 If after one hour there is an inadequate clinical response, the 0.625 mg dose may be repeated.
 Additional doses of 1.25 mg may be administered at six hour intervals.
 For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy, the recommended initial dose of oral enalapril maleate is 5 mg once a day for patients with creatinine clearance > 30 mL / min and 2.5 mg once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL / min.
 Single doses of enalaprilat injection as low as 0.2 mg have produced excessive hypotension in normotensive patients with these diagnoses.
 The starting dose should be no greater than 0.625 mg administered intravenously over a period of no less than five minutes and preferably longer (up to one hour).
 It may be administered as provided or diluted with up to 50 mL of a compatible diluent.

 The Esclim (estradiol transdermal) transdermal system should be replaced every 3 to 4 days (twice a week).
 For the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, and vulval and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause, and of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure, treatment is generally initiated with the Esclim (estradiol transdermal) 0.025 transdermal system applied to the skin twice weekly, but the initial selection of the dose should be based on the evaluation of the severity of the patient’s symptomatology and responsiveness to estrogen treatment.
 One or two capsules every four hours.
 Total daily dosage should not exceed 6 capsules.
 Most patients on maintenance therapy are stabilized on 900 mg daily, e.g., ESKALITH (lithium carbonate) CR 450 mg b.i.d.
 When the previous dosage of immediate - release lithium is not a multiple of 450 mg, e.g., 1,500 mg, initiate ESKALITH (lithium carbonate) CR at the multiple of 450 mg nearest to, but below, the original daily dose, i.e., 1,350 mg.
 In the above example, with a total daily dose of 1,350 mg, generally 450 mg of ESKALITH (lithium carbonate) CR should be given in the morning and 900 mg of ESKALITH (lithium carbonate) CR in the evening.
 If desired, the total daily dose of 1,350 mg can be given in 3 equal 450 - mg doses of ESKALITH (lithium carbonate) CR.
 When patients require closer titration than that available with doses of ESKALITH (lithium carbonate) CR in increments of 450 mg, immediate - release capsules should be used.
 Acute Mania: Optimal patient response to ESKALITH (lithium carbonate) can usually be established and maintained with 1,800 mg per day in divided doses.
 Such doses will normally produce the desired serum lithium level ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq / L.
 Long - Term Control: The desirable serum lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq / L.
 Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 900 mg to 1,200 mg per day in divided doses will maintain this level.
 For patients with severe liver impairment (Child Pugh Class C), a dose of 20 mg of esomeprazole magnesium delayed - release capsules should not be exceeded [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Alternatively, for patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the esomeprazole magnesium delayed - release capsule can be opened, and the pellets inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce.
 For patients who have a nasogastric tube in place, esomeprazole magnesium delayed - release capsules can be opened and the intact pellets emptied into a 60 mL catheter tipped syringe and mixed with 50 mL of water.
 The usual initial dosage range is 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms.
 Treatment is usually initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol, adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms; the minimal effective dose for maintenance therapy should be determined by titration.
 Suggested dosage is 10 mg three times daily for a period of at least three months.
 Suggested dosage is 1 to 2 mg three times daily.
 The usual dosage range is 2 to 4 g (marked on the applicator) daily for one or two weeks, then gradually reduced to one half initial dosage for a similar period.

 EstroGel 0.06% 1.25 g per day is the single approved dose for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause.
 Two dosage regimens are described, one of which may be more convenient or suitable than the other for an individual patient.
 With either regimen, the patient takes one tablet daily for 21 consecutive days followed by one week of no tablets.
 For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 21 - tablet regimen on the eighth day, Sunday, after taking her last tablet.
 She starts taking one tablet daily, beginning with the first tablet in the top row.
 For all subsequent cycles, the patient begins a new 21 - tablet regimen on the eighth day after taking her last tablet, again starting with the first tablet in the top row after placing the appropriate day label strip over the preprinted days on the tablet dispenser.
 Menstruation usually begins two or three days, but may begin as late as the fourth or fifth day, after discontinuing medication.
 If spotting occurs while on the usual regimen of one tablet daily, the patient should continue medication without interruption.
 If a patient forgets to take one or more white tablets, the following is suggested:
 One tablet is missed
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (Week 1 or Week 2)
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (Week 3)
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one tablet is missed, the possibility of spotting or bleeding is increased.
 This is particularly likely to occur if two or more consecutive tablets are missed.
 This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age.
 FDA Rev date: 6 / 14 / 2002
 The patient takes one white tablet daily for 21 days.
 Upon completion of all 21 white tablets, and without interruption, the patient takes one brown tablet daily for 7 days.
 Adhering to this regimen of one white tablet daily for 21 days, followed without interruption by one brown tablet daily for 7 days, the patient will start all subsequent cycles on a Sunday.
 She starts taking one white tablet daily, beginning with the first white tablet in the top row.
 For all subsequent cycles, the patient begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the eighth day after taking her last white tablet, again starting with the first tablet in the top row after placing the appropriate day label strip over the preprinted days on the tablet dispenser.
 Following this regimen of 21 white tablets and 7 brown tablets, the patient will start all subsequent cycles on the same day of the week as the first course.
 Menstruation usually begins two or three days, but may begin as late as the fourth or fifth day, after the brown tablets have been started.
 If the patient forgets to take one or more white tablets, the following is suggested:
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (Week 1 or Week 2)
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (Week 3)
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one white tablet is missed, the possibility of spotting or bleeding is increased.
 This is particularly likely to occur if two or more consecutive white tablets are missed.
 If the patient forgets to take any of the seven brown tablets in week four, those brown tablets that were missed are discarded and one brown tablet is taken each day until the pack is empty.

 The smallest dose required to produce gradual weight loss (about 1 to 2 pounds per day) is recommended.
 Onset of diuresis usually occurs at 50 to 100 mg for adults.
 After diuresis has been achieved, the minimally effective dose (usually from 50 to 200 mg daily) may be given on a continuous or intermittent dosage schedule.
 Dosage adjustments are usually in 25 to 50 mg increments to avoid derangement of water and electrolyte excretion.
 Day 1 — 50 mg once daily after a meal Day 2 — 50 mg twice daily after meals, if necessary Day 3 — 100 mg in the morning and 50 to 100 mg following the afternoon or evening meal, depending upon response to the morning dose.
 A few patients may require initial and maintenance doses as high as 200 mg twice daily.
 (excluding infants, see CONTRAINDICATIONS): The initial dose should be 25 mg.
 Careful stepwise increments in dosage of 25 mg should be made to achieve effective maintenance.
 Therefore, when adding ethacrynic acid, the initial dose and changes of dose should be in 25 mg increments, to avoid electrolyte depletion.
 The usual intravenous dose is 1.5 to 5.0 mL per varix.

 Local anesthetic, such as procaine hydrochloride, and a syringe Bactericidal painting solution20 mL syringe containing 15 mL of Ethiodol (ethiodized oil) with an 18 inch catheter to which is affixed a 27 or 30 gauge needle.
 The lymphatic, thus isolated, is then cannulated with a 27 or 30 gauge5 / 8 inch needle, depending upon the size of the lymphatic selected for injection.
 The injection should be started at a slow rate, i.e., 0.1 mL to 0.2 mL per minute.
 Radiographic monitoring either by fluoroscopy or serial radiographs after 1 mL to 2 mL has been injected, will confirm the proper intralymphatic placement of the needle, rule out accidental intravenous injection or extravasation of the medium by perforation or rupture of the lymphatic.
 If the injection is satisfactory, approximately 6 to 8 mL, are then injected.
 Two to four mL of Ethiodol (ethiodized oil) injected into the upper extremity will suffice to demonstrate the axillary and supraclavicular nodes.
 In penile lymphography approximately 2 to 3 mL of Ethiodol (ethiodized oil) is required.

 There may be clinical settings, particularly the postpartum period in neonates with known or suspected exposure to maternal opioid use, where it is preferable to avoid the abrupt precipitation of opioid withdrawal symptoms.
 To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that hydromorphone is available as both immediate - release 8 mg tablets and extended - release 8 mg tablets.
 Patients considered opioid - tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg of morphine daily, or at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, or at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.
 The recommended starting dose of EXALGO is 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to EXALGO:
 Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1
 Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of EXALGO to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose.
 To calculate the 24 - hour EXALGO dose, use a conversion factor of 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of EXALGO.
 Step 2: Use the conversion factor of 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of EXALGO.
 Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of EXALGO to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the converted dose.
 Dosage adjustments of EXALGO may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia.
 When a patient no longer requires therapy with EXALGO, taper doses gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 or 3 days down to a dose of 8 mg before discontinuation of therapy, to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the opioid - tolerant patient.
 The recommended dosage of EXELON Oral Solution and Capsules in Alzheimer's disease is 6 mg to 12 mg per day, administered twice a day (daily doses of 3 mg to 6 mg twice a day).

 Initiate treatment with the 1.5 mg twice a day with EXELON.
 After a minimum of 4 weeks and if well tolerated, increase the dose to 3 mg twice a day.
 Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg twice a day and 6 mg twice a day should be attempted after a minimum of 4 weeks at the previous dose and if well tolerated.
 The maximum dose is 6 mg twice a day (12 mg per day).
 If dosing is interrupted for more than 3 days, treatment should be restarted with 1.5 mg twice a day and titrated as described above [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Patients with mild (Child - Pugh score 5 to 6) and moderate (Child - Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment may be able to only tolerate lower doses.
 For mild to moderate AD and PDD patients, continue the effective dose of 9.5 mg / 24 hours for as long as therapeutic benefit persists.
 The effective dosage of EXELON PATCH is 9.5 mg / 24 hours or 13.3 mg / 24 hours administered once per day; replace with a new patch every 24 hours.
 The effective dosage of EXELON PATCH in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease is 13.3 mg / 24 hours administered once per day; replace with a new patch every 24 hours.
 Consider using the 4.6 mg / 24 hours EXELON PATCH as both the initial and maintenance dose in patients with mild (Child - Pugh score 5 to 6) to moderate (Child - Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Carefully titrate and monitor patients with low body weight ( < 50 kg) for toxicities (e.g., excessive nausea, vomiting) and consider reducing the maintenance dose to the 4.6 mg / 24 hours EXELON PATCH if such toxicities develop.
 The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10 / 320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure.
 The clinical response to Exforge should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10 / 320 mg.
 The usual starting dose is Exforge 5 / 160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume - depleted.
 The maximum recommended dose of Exforge HCT is 10 / 320 / 25 mg.
 The evidence should include the transfusion of at least 100 mL / kg of packed red blood cells (e.g., at least 20 units of packed red blood cells for a 40 kg person or more in individuals weighing more than 40 kg), and a serum ferritin consistently greater than 1000 mcg / L.
 The recommended initial dose of Exjade for patients 2 years of age and older is 20 mg per kg body weight orally, once daily.
 Make dose adjustments in steps of 5 or 10 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient's response and therapeutic goals.
 In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 30 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2500 mcg / L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 40 mg per kg may be considered.
 Doses above 40 mg per kg are not recommended.
 If the serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 mcg / L, consider temporarily interrupting therapy with Exjade [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Exjade therapy should only be considered when a patient with NTDT syndrome has an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe / g dw and a serum ferritin greater than 300 mcg / L.
 Restart treatment when the LIC rises again to more than 5 mg Fe / g dw.
 Disperse doses of less than 1 g in 3.5 ounces of liquid and doses of 1 g or greater in 7 ounces of liquid.
 Do not use Exjade in patients with serum creatinine greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance less than 40 mL / min [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].
 The recommended dose of EXONDYS 51 is 30 milligrams per kilogram administered once weekly as a 35 to 60 minute intravenous infusion.
 One example of the recommended dose comes from a study in patients undergoing bunionectomy.
 A total of 8 mL (106 mg) was administered as 7 mL of EXPAREL infiltrated into the tissues surrounding the osteotomy, and 1 mL infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue.
 A total of 20 mL (266 mg) of EXPAREL was diluted with 10 mL of saline, for a total of 30 mL, divided into six 5 mL aliquots, injected by visualizing the anal sphincter as a clock face and slowly infiltrating one aliquot to each of the even numbers to produce a field block.
 In addition, different liposomal or lipid - complexed products with a common active ingredient may vary from one another in the chemical composition and physical form of the lipid component.
 The recommended starting dose is 0.0625 mg (0.25 mL) subcutaneously every other day, with dose increases over a six - week period to the recommended dose of 0.25 mg (1 mL) every other day (see Table 1).
 Table 1: Schedule for Dose Titration
 If a dose of EXTAVIA is missed, then it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers or is able to take it.
 It should be administered only as a single daily exchange for the long dwell in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or automated peritoneal dialysis.
 Recommended initial pre - meal doses are based on clinical trials in which patients were requested to eat three meals per day.
 Initial pre - meal doses may be calculated using the following formula: [Body weight (kg) X 0.05 mg / kg = pre - meal dose (mg)] rounded down to the nearest whole milligram number (e.g., 3.7 mg rounded down to 3 mg).
 A 1 mg blister of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 3 IU of subcutaneously injected regular human insulin.
 A 3 mg blister of EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) inhaled insulin is approximately equivalent to 8 IU of subcutaneously injected regular human insulin.
 Table 8provides the approximate IU dose of regular subcutaneous human insulin for EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) inhaled insulin doses from 1 mg to 6 mg.
 Table 8: Approximate Equivalent IU Dose of Regular Human Subcutaneous Insulin for EXUBERA (insulin human [rdna origin]) Inhaled Insulin Doses Ranging from 1 mg to 6 mg
 Patients should combine 1 mg and 3 mg blisters so that the least number of blisters per dose are taken (e.g., a 4 mg dose should be administered as one 1 mg blister and one 3 mg blister).
 Consecutive inhalation of three 1 mg unit dose blisters results in significantly greater insulinexposure than inhalation of one 3 mg unit dose blister.
 Therefore, three 1 mg doses should notbe substituted for one 3 mg dose (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).When a patient is stabilized on a dosing regimen that includes 3 mg blisters, and the 3 mg blisters become temporarily unavailable, the patient can temporarily substitute two 1 mg blisters for one 3 mg blister.
 The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months).

 Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies].
 Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months).
 The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months).
 Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies].

 The recommended dosage of Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) is 1.0 mg / kg body weight infused every 2 weeks as an IV infusion.
 The initial IV infusion rate should be no more than 0.25 mg / min (15 mg / hr).
 After patient tolerance to the infusion is well established, the infusion rate may be increased in increments of 0.05 to 0.08 mg / min (increments of 3 to 5 mg / hr) with each subsequent infusion.
 For patients weighing < 30 kg, the maximum infusion rate should remain at 0.25 mg / min (15 mg / hr).
 The initial rechallenge administration should be a low dose at a lower infusion rate, e.g., ½ the therapeutic dose (0.5 mg / kg) at ½5 the initial standard recommended rate (0.01 mg / min).
 Once a patient tolerates the infusion, the dose may be increased to reach the approved dose of 1.0 mg / kg and the infusion rate may be increased by slowly titrating upwards (doubled every 30 minutes up to a maximum rate of 0.25 mg / min), as tolerated.
 The number of 35 mg and 5 mg vials needed is based on the patient's body weight (kg) and the recommended dose of 1.0 mg / kg.
 Select a combination of 35 mg and 5 mg vials so that the total number of mg is equal to or greater than the patient's number of kg of body weight.
 Reconstitute each 35 mg vial of Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) by slowly injecting 7.2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP down the inside wall of each vial.
 Each vial will yield a 5.0 mg / mL clear, colorless solution (total extractable amount per vial is 35 mg, 7.0 mL).
 Reconstitute each 5 mg vial of Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) by slowly injecting 1.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP down the inside wall of each vial.
 Each vial will yield a 5.0 mg / mL clear, colorless solution (total extractable amount per vial is 5 mg, 1.0 mL).

 At week 3, increase the Felbatol® dosage up to 3600 mg / day and continue to reduce the dosage of other AEDs as clinically indicated.
 Adjunctive Therapy: Felbatol® should be added at 1200 mg / day in divided doses three or four times daily while reducing present AEDs by 20% in order to control plasma concentrations of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine and its metabolites.
 Increase the dosage of Felbatol® by 1200 mg / day increments at weekly intervals to 3600 mg / day.
 While the above Felbatol® conversion guidelines may result in a Felbatol® 3600 mg / day dose within 3 weeks, in some patients titration to a 3600 mg / day Felbatol® dose has been achieved in as little as 3 days with appropriate adjustment of other AEDs.
 Adjunctive Therapy: Felbatol® should be added at 15 mg / kg / day in divided doses three or four times daily while reducing present AEDs by 20% in order to control plasma levels of concurrent phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine and its metabolites.

 The dosage of FEMCON Fe (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets) is one white tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one brown tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 One white tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days followed by one brown tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a non - hormonal back - up method of birth control until she has taken a white tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 When the patient is switching from a 28 - day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of FEMCON Fe (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets) on the day after her last tablet.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken.
 Any time the patient misses two or more white tablets, she should also use another method of non - hormonal back - up contraception until she has taken a white
 If the patient misses one or more brown tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking white tablets again on the proper day.

 Patients considered opioid - tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg of morphine daily, or at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, or at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.
 As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patient's 24 - hour fentanyl requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate - release opioid) than to overestimate the 24 - hour fentanyl requirements which could result in adverse reactions.
 Do not use Table 1 to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to other therapies because this conversion to fentanyl transdermal system is conservative and will overestimate the dose of the new agent.
 Do not use Table 2 to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to other therapies because this conversion to fentanyl transdermal system is conservative and will overestimate the dose of the new agent.
 In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system.
 In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system.
 Therefore, evaluate patients for further titration after no less than two 3 - day applications before any further increase in dosage is made.
 Do not use Tables 1 and 2 to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to other therapies to avoid overestimating the dose of the new agent resulting in overdose of the new analgesic and possibly death.
 The initial dose of FENTORA is always 100 mcg with the only exception being patients already using Actiq.

 For repletion treatment most patients may require a cumulative dose of 1000 mg of elemental iron administered over 8 dialysis sessions.
 Data from Ferrlecit postmarketing spontaneous reports indicate that individual doses exceeding 125 mg may be associated with a higher incidence and / or severity of adverse events [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The recommended pediatric dosage of Ferrlecit for the repletion treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is 0.12 mL / kg Ferrlecit (1.5 mg / kg of elemental iron) diluted in 25 mL 0.9% sodium chloride and administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour per dialysis session.
 The maximum dosage should not exceed 125 mg per dose.
 Over the course of treatment, doses of Fertinex (urofollitropin) TM may range between 75 IU to 300 IU per day depending on the individual patient response.
 It is recommended that the initial dose of the first cycle be 75 IU of Fertinex (urofollitropin) TM per day, ADMINISTERED SUBCUTANEOUSLY.
 The dose should not be increased more than twice in any cycle or by more than one ampule (75 IU) per adjustment.
 To complete follicular development and effect ovulation in the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG, 5,000 U to 10,000 U, should be given 1 day after the last dose of Fertinex (urofollitropin) TM.
 As in the initial cycle, 5,000 U to 10,000 U of hCG must be given 1 day after the last dose of Fertinex (urofollitropin) TM to complete follicular development and induce ovulation.
 For Assisted Reproductive Technologies, therapy with Fertinex (urofollitropin) TM should be initiated in the early follicular phase (cycle day 2 or 3) at a dose of 150 IU per day, until sufficient follicular development is attained.
 Dissolve the contents of one or more ampules of Fertinex (urofollitropin) TM in one - half one mL of sterile saline (concentration should not exceed 225 IU / 0.5 mL) and ADMINISTER SUBCUTANEOUSLY immediately.
 The recommended dose range for FETZIMA is 40 mg to 120 mg once daily, with or without food.

 Patients who are currently being treated with other bupropion products at 450 mg / day can be switched to an equivalent dose of FORFIVO XL once daily.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by nonintravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with FORFIVO XL is unclear.
 The maximum recommended daily dose of FORTAMET® Extended - Release Tablets in adults is 2500 mg.
 The usual starting dose of FORTAMET® (metformin hydrochloride) Extended - Release Tablets is 1000 mg taken with a full glass of water once daily with the evening meal, although 500 mg may be utilized when clinically appropriate.
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2500 mg once daily with the evening meal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ).
 Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving immediate - release metformin treatment may be safely switched to FORTAMET® once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2500 mg once daily.
 If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of FORTAMET® and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without FORTAMET®.
 FORTAMET® therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy.
 For patients not responding adequately, the dose of FORTAMET® should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved.
 The maximum recommended daily dose for FORTAMET® Extended - Release Tablets is 2500 mg.
 The usual adult dosage is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours.
 Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL / min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion.
 In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of FORTAZ may be given.
 When only serum creatinine is available, the following formula (Cockcroft's equation)5 may be used to estimate creatinine clearance.
 In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of FORTAZ daily were it not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose given in the table above may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately.
 In patients undergoing hemodialysis, a loading dose of 1 gram is recommended, followed by 1 gram after each hemodialysis period.
 In such patients, a loading dose of 1 gram of FORTAZ may be given, followed by 500 mg every 24 hours.
 In addition to IV use, FORTAZ can be incorporated in the dialysis fluid at a concentration of 250 mg for 2 L of dialysis fluid.
 For IM administration, FORTAZ should be constituted with one of the following diluents: Sterile Water for Injection, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, or 0.5% or 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection.
 Slowly inject directly into the vein over a period of 3 to 5 minutes or give through the tubing of an administration set while the patient is also receiving one of the compatible IV fluids (see Compatibility And Stability).
 For IV infusion, constitute the 500 - mg, 1 - gram, or 2 - gram vial and add an appropriate quantity of the resulting solution to an IV container with one of the compatible IV fluids listed under the COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY section.
 However, during infusion of a solution containing ceftazidime, it is desirable to discontinue the other solution.
 TwistVial™ vials are to be constituted only with 50 or 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection in compatible flexible diluent containers (see Instructions for Constitution).
 Solutions at concentrations between 1 and 40 mg / mL in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection; 1 / 6 M Sodium Lactate Injection; 5% Dextrose Injection; 5% Dextrose and 0.225% Sodium Chloride Injection; 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection; 10% Dextrose Injection; Ringer's Injection, USP; Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP; 10% Invert Sugar in Water for Injection; and NORMOSOL® - M in 5% Dextrose Injection may be stored for up to 12 hours at room temperature or for 3 days if refrigerated.
 The 1 - and 2 - g FORTAZ TwistVial™ vials, when diluted in 50 or 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, may be stored for up to 12 hours at room temperature or for 3 days under refrigeration.
 Ceftazidime at a concentration of 4 mg / mL has been found compatible for 12 hours at room temperature or for 3 days under refrigeration in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection when admixed with: cefuroxime sodium (ZINACEF®) 3 mg / mL, heparin 10 or 50 U / mL, or potassium chloride 10 or 40 mEq / L.
 The recommended dose is 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.
 The recommended dose is 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.
 The recommended dose is 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.
 The recommended starting dose of FORTESTA is 40 mg of testosterone (4 pump actuations) applied once daily to the thighs in the morning.
 The dose can be adjusted between a minimum of 10 mg of testosterone and a maximum of 70 mg of testosterone.
 Table 1 describes the dose adjustments required at each titration step.
 Patients should be instructed to use one finger to gently rub FORTESTA evenly onto the front and inner area of each thigh as directed in Table 2.
 The recommended dose of Fortical nasal spray is 1 spray (200 International Units) per day intranasally, alternating nostrils daily.
 Patients who use Fortical nasal spray should receive adequate calcium (at least 1000 mg elemental calcium per day) and Vitamin D (at least 400 International Units per day).
 Although alendronate tablets 5 mg, 10 mg, 35 mg, and 40 mg are available in the marketplace, FOSAMAX is no longer marketed in the 5 mg, 10 mg, 35 mg, and 40 mg strengths.
 The recommended dosage is one 5 mg tablet once daily, except for postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen, for whom the recommended dosage is one 10 mg tablet once daily.
 The recommended treatment regimen is 40 mg once a day for six months.
 If a once - weekly dose of FOSAMAX is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember.
 They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.
 The recommended dosage is one 70 mg alendronate / 2800 international units vitamin D3 or one 70 mg alendronate / 5600 international units vitamin D3 tablet once weekly.
 For most osteoporotic women, the appropriate dose is FOSAMAX PLUS D (70 mg alendronate / 5600 international units vitamin D3) once weekly.
 The recommended dosage is one 70 mg alendronate / 2800 international units vitamin D3 or one 70 mg alendronate / 5600 international units vitamin D3 tablet once weekly.
 For most osteoporotic men, the appropriate dose is FOSAMAX PLUS D (70 mg alendronate / 5600 international units vitamin D3) once weekly.
 The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400 - 800 international units daily.
 FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg / 2800 international units and 70 mg / 5600 international units are intended to provide seven days' worth of 400 and 800 international units daily vitamin D in a single, once - weekly dose, respectively.
 If a once - weekly dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D is missed, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember.
 They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.
 An individualized dose at the required concentration (24 mg / mL or 12 mg / mL) for the route of administration (central line or peripheral line) needs to be aseptically prepared prior to dispensing.
 When a peripheral vein catheter is used, the 24 mg / mL injection must be diluted to a 12 mg / mL concentration with 5% dextrose in water or with a normal saline solution prior to administration to avoid local irritation of peripheral veins.
 It is recommended that 750 – 1000 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution should be given prior to the first infusion of FOSCAVIR to establish diuresis.
 With subsequent infusions, 750 – 1000 mL of hydration fluid should be given with 90 – 120 mg / kg of FOSCAVIR, and 500 mL with 40 – 60 mg / kg of FOSCAVIR.
 Following induction treatment the recommended maintenance dose of FOSCAVIR for CMV retinitis is 90 mg / kg / day to 120 mg / kg / day (individualized for renal function) given as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours.
 Because the superiority of the 120 mg / kg / day has not been established in controlled trials, and given the likely relationship of higher plasma foscarnet levels to toxicity, it is recommended that most patients be started on maintenance treatment with a dose of 90 mg / kg / day.
 Escalation to 120 mg / kg / day may be considered should early reinduction be required because of retinitis progression.
 Some patients who show excellent tolerance to FOSCAVIR may benefit from initiation of maintenance treatment at 120 mg / kg / day earlier in their treatment.
 Safety and efficacy data for patients with baseline serum creatinine levels greater than 2.8 mg / dL or measured 24 - hour creatinine clearances < 50 mL / min are limited.
 During FOSCAVIR therapy if creatinine clearance falls below the limits of the dosing nomograms (0.4 mL / min / kg), FOSCAVIR should be discontinued, the patient hydrated, and monitored daily until resolution of renal impairment is ensured.
 FOSCAVIR should be discontinued if creatinine clearance drops below 0.4 mL / min / kg.
 The recommended initial total daily dose of FOSRENOL is 1500 mg. Titrate the dose every 2 - 3 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphate level is reached.
 In clinical studies of ESRD patients, FOSRENOL doses up to 4500 mg were evaluated.
 Most patients required a total daily dose between 1500 mg and 3000 mg to reduce plasma phosphate levels to less than 6.0 mg / dL.
 Doses were generally titrated in increments of 750 mg / day.
 In patients with unstable angina or non - Q - wave myocardial infarction, the recommended dose of FRAGMIN Injection is 120 IU / kg of body weight, but not more than 10,000 IU, subcutaneously every 12 hours with concurrent oral aspirin (75 to 165 mg once daily) therapy.
 The usual duration of administration is 5 to 8 days.
 Table 1 lists the volume of FRAGMIN in mL (based on the 3.8 mL multiple - dose vial 25,000 IU / mL) and quantity of FRAGMIN in IU, to be administered for a range of patient weights.
 The usual duration of administration is 5 to 10 days after surgery; up to 14 days of treatment with FRAGMIN have been well tolerated in clinical trials.
 In patients undergoing abdominal surgery with a risk of thromboembolic complications, the recommended dose of FRAGMIN is 2,500 IU administered by subcutaneous injection once daily, starting 1 to 2 hours prior to surgery and repeated once daily postoperatively.
 The usual duration of administration is 5 to 10 days.
 In patients undergoing abdominal surgery associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications, such as malignant disorder, the recommended dose of FRAGMIN is 5,000 IU subcutaneously the evening before surgery, then once daily postoperatively.
 The usual duration of administration is 5 to 10 days.
 Alternatively, in patients with malignancy, 2,500 IU of FRAGMIN can be administered subcutaneously 1 to 2 hours before surgery followed by 2,500 IU subcutaneously 12 hours later, and then 5,000 IU once daily postoperatively.
 The usual duration of administration is 5 to 10 days.
 In medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness, the recommended dose of FRAGMIN is 5,000 IU administered by subcutaneous injection once daily.
 In patients with cancer and symptomatic venous thromboembolism, the recommended dosing of FRAGMIN is as follows: for the first 30 days of treatment administer FRAGMIN 200 IU / kg total body weight subcutaneously once daily.
 The total daily dose should not exceed 18,000 IU.
 Administer FRAGMIN at a dose of approximately 150 IU / kg, subcutaneously once daily during Months 2 through 6.
 The total daily dose should not exceed 18,000 IU.
 In patients with severely impaired renal function (CrCl < 30 mL / min), monitor anti - Xa levels to determine the appropriate FRAGMIN dose.
 Target anti - Xa range is 0.5 - 1.5 IU / mL.
 The entire length of the needle should be inserted at a 45 to 90 degree angle.
 The recommended dose is a single tablet of FROVA (frovatriptan 2.5 mg) taken orally with fluids.
 The total daily dose of FROVA should not exceed 3 tablets (3 x 2.5 mg per 24 hour period).
 The recommended dose of FULYZAQ is one 125 mg delayedrelease tablet taken orally two times a day, with or without food.
 CAUTION: Under no circumstances should a total daily dose of 1.5 mg / kg be exceeded.
 The recommended concentration for intravenous infusion is 0.1 mg / mL (1 mg / 10 mL).
 A single intravenous test dose (1 mg in 20 mL of 5% dextrose solution) administered over 20 to 30 minutes may be preferred.
 However, in those patients having severe and rapidly progressive fungal infection, therapy may be initiated with a daily dose of 0.3 mg / kg of body weight.
 In patients with impaired cardio - renal function or a severe reaction to the test dose, therapy should be initiated with smaller daily doses (i.e., 5 to 10 mg).
 Depending on the patient's cardio - renal status (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests), doses may gradually be increased by 5 to 10 mg per day to final daily dosage of 0.5 to 0.7 mg / kg.
 Total daily dosage may range up to 1.0 mg / kg per day or up to 1.5 mg / kg when given on alternate days.
 Therapy with intravenous amphotericin B for sporotrichosis has ranged up to 9 months with a total dose up to 2.5 g.
 Aspergillosis has been treated with amphotericin B intravenously for a period up to 11 months with a total dose up to 3.6 g.
 A cumulative dose of at least 3 g of amphotericin B is recommended to treat rhinocerebral phycomycosis.
 Although a total dose of 3 to 4 g will infrequently cause lasting renal impairment, this would seem a reasonable minimum where there is clinical evidence of invasion of deep tissue.
 Reconstitute as follows: An initial concentrate of 5 mg amphotericin B per mL is first prepared by rapidly expressing 10 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP without a bacteriostatic agent directly into the lyophilized cake, using a sterile needle (minimum diameter: 20 gauge) and syringe.
 The infusion solution, providing 0.1 mg amphotericin B per mL, is then obtained by further dilution (1:50) with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP of pH above 4.2.
 Commercial Dextrose Injection usually has a pH above 4.2; however, if it is below 4.2, then 1 or 2 mL of buffer should be added to the Dextrose Injection before it is used to dilute the concentrated solution of amphotericin B.
 Dibasic sodium phosphate (anhydrous) 1.59 g Monobasic sodium phosphate (anhydrous) 0.96 g Water for Injection, USP qs 100.0 Ml
 5 - 7 mg / kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).
 The following table is based on an average weight in each range receiving 5 to 6 mg / kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses.
 It can be used to calculate an average dose of Furadantin Oral Suspension (25 mg / 5mL) for pediatric patients.
 For long - term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 - 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate.
 For long - term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg / kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.
 FUROX - ONE TABLETS, 100 mg each, are green and scored to facilitate adjustment of dosage.
 Average Adult Dosage: One 100 - mg tablet four times daily.
 Average Dosage for Children: Those 5 years of age or older should receive 25 to 50 mg (¼ to ½ tablet) four times daily.
 FUROXONE (furazolidone) LIQUID composition: each 15 ml tablespoonful contains Furoxone (furazolidone) 50 mg per 15 ml (3.
 33 mg per ml) in a light - yellow aqueous vehicle.
 5 years or older † ½ to 1 tablespoonful four times daily (7.515.

 5 - 5.0 ml)
 This dosage is based on an average dose of 5 mg of Furoxone (furazolidone) per Kg (2.3 mg per lb) of body weight given in four equally divided doses during 24 hours.
 The maximal dose of 8.8 mg of Furoxone (furazolidone) per Kg (4 mg per lb) of body weight per 24 hours should probably not be exceeded because of the possibility of producing nausea or emesis.
 The recommendations for Fusilev rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 grams / m² administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (see methotrexate package insert for full prescribing information).
 Fusilev rescue at a dose of 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg / m²) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion.
 Fusilev administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH of 7.0 or greater) should be continued until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10 - 8 M (0.05 micromolar).
 Table 1 : Guidelines for Fusilev Dosage and Administration
 If significant clinical toxicity is observed, Fusilev rescue should be extended for an additional 24 hours (total of 14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses of therapy.
 Fusilev 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg / m² ) should be administered IV every 6 hours until the serum methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M.
 If the 24 hour serum creatinine has increased 50% over baseline or if the 24 hour methotrexate level is greater than 5 x 10 - 6 M or the 48 hour level is greater than 9 x 10 - 7 M, the dose of Fusilev should be increased to 50 mg / m² IV every 3 hours until the methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M. Hydration (3 L / day) and urinary alkalinization with NaHCO3 should be employed concomitantly.
 This five - day treatment course may be repeated at 4 week (28 - day) intervals, for 2 courses and then repeated at 4 to 5 week (28 to 35 day) intervals provided that the patient has completely recovered from the toxic effects of the prior treatment course.
 The recommended dose of FUZEON is 90 mg (1 mL) twice daily injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen.
 In pediatric patients 6 years through 16 years of age, the recommended dosage of FUZEON is 2 mg / kg twice daily up to a maximum dose of 90 mg twice daily injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen.
 Table 1 contains dosing guidelines for FUZEON based on body weight.
 FUZEON must only be reconstituted with 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection provided in the Convenience Kit.
 In patients not receiving concomitant enzyme - inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), the recommended starting dosage of FYCOMPA is 2 mg once daily taken orally at bedtime.
 Increase dosage by increments of 2 mg once daily no more frequently than at weekly intervals.
 The recommended maintenance dose range is 8 mg to 12 mg once daily in the absence of enzyme - inducing AEDs, although some patients may respond to a dose of 4 mg daily.
 A dose of 12 mg once daily resulted in somewhat greater reductions in seizure rates than the dose of 8 mg once daily, but with a substantial increase in adverse reactions.
 In patients not receiving concomitant enzyme - inducing AEDs, the recommended starting dosage of FYCOMPA is 2 mg once daily taken orally at bedtime.
 Increase dosage by increments of 2 mg once daily no more frequently than at weekly intervals.
 In patients not taking enzyme - inducing AEDs, the recommended maintenance dose is 8 mg once daily taken at bedtime.
 Patients who are tolerating FYCOMPA well at 8 mg once daily and require further control of seizures may benefit from a dose increase up to 12 mg once daily if tolerated.
 In patients receiving concomitant enzyme - inducing AEDs, the recommended starting dosage of FYCOMPA is 4 mg once daily taken orally at bedtime.
 Increase dosage by increments of 2 mg once daily no more frequently than at weekly intervals.
 The highest dose studied in patients on concomitant enzyme - inducing AEDs was 12 mg once daily.
 In patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose of FYCOMPA is 2 mg once daily.
 Increase dosage by increments of 2 mg once daily no more frequently than every 2 weeks.
 The maximum recommended daily dose is 6 mg for patients with mild hepatic impairment and 4 mg for patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
 In adolescents 12 to 18 years old, GABITRIL should be initiated at 4 mg once daily.
 The total daily dose of GABITRIL may be increased by 4 mg at the beginning of Week 2.
 Thereafter, the total daily dose may be increased by 4 to 8 mg at weekly intervals until clinical response is achieved or up to 32 mg / day.
 Doses above 32 mg / day have been tolerated in a small number of adolescent patients for a relatively short duration.
 In adults, GABITRIL should be initiated at 4 mg once daily.
 The total daily dose of GABITRIL may be increased by 4 to 8 mg at weekly intervals until clinical response is achieved or, up to 56 mg / day.
 Doses above 56 mg / day have not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials.
 Experience is limited in patients taking total daily doses above 32 mg / day using twice daily dosing.
 The screening trial employs GABLOFEN at a concentration of 50 mcg / mL.
 A 1 mL syringe (50 mcg / mL) is available for use in the screening trial.
 An initial bolus containing 50 micrograms in a volume of 1 milliliter is administered into the intrathecal space by barbotage over a period of not less than one minute.
 The second screening bolus dose consists of 75 micrograms in 1.5 milliliters.
 If the response is still inadequate, a final bolus screening dose of 100 micrograms in 2 milliliters may be administered 24 hours later.
 The starting screening dose for pediatric patients is the same as in adult patients, i.e., 50 mcg.
 However, for very small patients, a screening dose of 25 mcg may be tried first.
 Patients who do not respond to a 100 mcg intrathecal bolus should not be considered candidates for an implanted pump for chronic infusion.
 Use the 1 mL screening syringe only (50 mcg / mL) for bolus injection into the subarachnoid space.
 For a 50 mcg bolus dose, use 1 mL of the screening syringe.
 Use 1.5 mL of 50 mcg / mL baclofen injection for a 75 mcg bolus dose.
 For the maximum screening dose of 100 mcg, use 2 mL of 50 mcg / mL baclofen injection (2 screening syringes).
 For patients who require concentrations other than 500 mcg / mL, 1,000 mcg / mL or 2,000 mcg / mL, GABLOFEN must be diluted with sterile preservative free Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP.
 It may be important to titrate the dose to maintain some degree of muscle tone and allow occasional spasms to: 1) help support circulatory function, 2) possibly prevent the formation of deep vein thrombosis, 3) optimize activities of daily living and ease of care.
 Maintenance dosage for long term continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen has ranged from 12 mcg / day to 2,003 mcg / day, with most patients adequately maintained on 300 micrograms to 800 micrograms per day.
 There is limited experience with daily doses greater than 1,000 mcg / day.
 Maintenance dosage for long term continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen has ranged from 22 mcg / day to 1,400 mcg / day, with most patients adequately maintained on 90 micrograms to 703 micrograms per day.
 In clinical trials, only 3 of 150 patients required daily doses greater than 1,000 mcg / day.
 Average daily dose for patients under 12 years was 274 mcg / day, with a range of 24 mcg / day to 1,199 mcg / day.
 There is not sufficient experience to make firm recommendations for tolerance treatment; however, this “tolerance” has been treated on occasion, in hospital, by a “drug holiday” consisting of the gradual reduction of intrathecal baclofen over a 2 to 4 week period and switching to alternative methods of spasticity management.
 The recommended dose of Gadavist for adult and pediatric patients (including term neonates) is 0.1 mL / kg body weight (0.1 mmol / kg).
 Refer to Table 1 to determine the volume to be administered.
 The recommended adult dose is 50 mg as zinc three times daily (See Clinical Trials).
 Since 25 mg t.i.d.
 is also an effective dose in children 10 years of age or older or in women who are pregnant, it may be advisable to use a dose of zinc to 25 mg three times a day, as long as the patient is compliant with therapy.
 The dose can be raised to 50 mg t.i.d.
 GamaSTAN® S / D in a dose of 0.02 mL / kg is recommended for household and institutional hepatitis A case contacts.
 GamaSTAN® S / D should be given in a dose of 0.25 mL / kg to prevent or modify measles in a susceptible person exposed fewer than 6 days previously (1,2).
 A susceptible child who is exposed to measles and who is immunocompromised should receive a dose of 0.5 mL / kg (maximum dose, 15 mL) of GamaSTAN® S / D immediately (3).
 The dosage of Immune Globulin (Human) for exposed individuals who have underlying malignant disease should be 0.5 mL / kg or 15 mL maximum (1).
 If Varicella - Zoster Immune Globulin (Human) is unavailable, GamaSTAN® S / D at a dose of 0.6 to 1.2 mL / kg, promptly given, may also modify varicella (5).
 Some studies suggest that the use of GamaSTAN® S / D in exposed, susceptible women can lessen the likelihood of infection and fetal damage; therefore, GamaSTAN® S / D at a dose of 0.55 mL / kg may benefit those women who will not consider a therapeutic abortion (3).
 Doses over 10 mL should be divided and injected into several muscle sites to reduce local pain and discomfort.
 If the gluteal region is used when very large volumes are to be injected or multiple doses are necessary, the central region MUST be avoided; only the upper, outer quadrant should be used (9).
 The minimum serum concentration of IgG necessary for protection varies among patients and has not been established by controlled clinical trials B - cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) For patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and / or recurrent bacterial infections due to B - cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, a dose of 400 mg / kg every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended.
 Kawasaki Syndrome For patients with Kawasaki syndrome, either a single 1 g / kg dose or a dose of 400 mg / kg for four consecutive days beginning within seven days of the onset of fever, administered concomitantly with appropriate aspirin therapy (80 - 100 mg / kg / day in four divided doses) is recommended.44 Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) For patients with acute or chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, a dose of 1 g / kg is recommended.
 For patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and / or recurrent bacterial infections due to B - cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, a dose of 400 mg / kg every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended.
 For patients with Kawasaki syndrome, either a single 1 g / kg dose or a dose of 400 mg / kg for four consecutive days beginning within seven days of the onset of fever, administered concomitantly with appropriate aspirin therapy (80 - 100 mg / kg / day in four divided doses) is recommended.44
 For patients with acute or chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, a dose of 1 g / kg is recommended.
 In general, it is recommended that patients beginning therapy with IGIV or switching from one IGIV product to another be started at the lower rates of infusion and should be advanced to the maximal rate only after they have tolerated several infusions at intermediate rates of infusion.
 For patients with Primary Immunodeficiency, monthly doses of approximately 300 - 600 mg / kg infused at 3 to 4 week intervals are commonly used.23,24 As there are significant differences in the half - life of IgG among patients with Primary Immunodeficiency, the frequency and amount of immunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient.
 During the first infusion of the Phase 3 clinical study, GAMMAGARD LIQUID (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) was infused at an initial rate of 0.5 mL / kg / hr (0.8 mg / kg / min).
 The rate was gradually increased every 30 minutes to a rate of 5.0 mL / kg / hr (8.9 mg / kg / min) if it was well tolerated.
 Fifty - eight subjects (95%) achieved a maximum rate of 4.0 mL / kg / hr or greater and of these, 16 subjects (26%) attained a rate of 5.0 mL / kg / hr.
 In general, it is recommended that patients beginning therapy with IGIV or switching from one IGIV product to another be started at the lower rates and then advanced to the maximal rate if they have tolerated several infusions at intermediate rates of infusion.
 Although there are no prospective studies demonstrating that any concentration or rate of infusion is completely safe, it is believed that risk is decreased at lower rates of infusion.46 Therefore, as a guideline, it is recommended that these patients who are judged to be at risk of renal dysfunction or thrombotic complications be gradually titrated up to a more conservative maximal rate of less than 3.3 mgIgG / kg / min ( < 2mL / kg / hr).
 The recommended dose of Gammaplex for patients with PI is 300 to 800 mg / kg (6 to 16 mL / kg), administered every 3 to 4 weeks.
 The recommended dose of Gammaplex for patients with ITP is 1 g / kg (20 mL / kg) on 2 consecutive days, providing a total dose of 2 g / kg.
 1 g / kg / day for 2 days) in patients at increased risk of thrombosis, hemolysis, acute kidney injury, or volume overload [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 400 mg / kg per day for 5 consecutive days) are not available for Gammaplex.
 The buffering capacity of GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) is 35.0 mEq / L (0.35 mEq / g protein).
 A dose of 1 g / kg body weight therefore represents an acid load of 0.35 mEq / kg body weight.
 The total buffering capacity of whole blood in a normal individual is 45 – 50 mEq / L of blood, or 3.6 mEq / kg body weight [15].
 Thus, the acid load delivered with a dose of 1 g / kg of GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) would be neutralized by the buffering capacity of whole blood alone, even if the dose was infused instantaneously.
 The dose of GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) for replacement therapy in primary immune deficiency diseases is 300 to 600 mg / kg body weight (3 - 6 mL / kg) administered every 3 to 4 weeks.
 GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) may be administered at a total dose of 2 g / kg, divided in two doses of 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) given on two consecutive days or into five doses of 0.4 g / kg (4 mL / kg) given on five consecutive days.
 If after administration of the first of two daily 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) doses, an adequate increase in the platelet count is observed at 24 hours, the second dose of 1g / kg (10 mL / kg) body weight may be withheld.
 Forty - eight ITP subjects were treated with 2 g / kg GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) , divided in two 1 g / kg doses (10 mL / kg) given on two successive days.
 With this dose regimen 35 / 39 subjects (90%) responded with a platelet count from less than or equal to 20 x109 / L to more than or equal to 50 x109 / L within 7 days after treatment.
 [11] The high dose regimen (1 g / kg × 1 - 2 days) is not recommended for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be a concern.
 GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) may be initially administered as a total loading dose of 2 g / kg (20 mL / kg) given in divided doses over two to four consecutive days.
 GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) may be administered as a maintenance infusion of 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) administered over 1 day or divided into two doses of 0.5 g / kg (5 mL / kg) given on two consecutive days, every 3 weeks.
 Only 18 gauge needles should be used to penetrate the stopper for dispensing product from the 10 mL vial; 16 gauge needles or dispensing pins should only be used with 25 mL vial sizes and larger.
 It is recommended that GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) should initially be infused at a rate of 0.01 mL / kg per minute (1 mg / kg per minute) for the first 30 minutes.
 If well - tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 0.08 mL / kg per minute (8 mg / kg per minute).
 GAMUNEX (immune globulin intravenous (human) 10%) may be stored for 36 months at 2 - 8ºC (36 - 46ºF) from the date of manufacture AND product may be stored at temperatures not to exceed 25ºC (77º F) for up to 6 months any time during the 36 month shelf life , after which the product must be immediately discarded.
 The buffering capacity of GAMUNEX - C is 35.0 mEq / L (0.35 mEq / g protein).
 A dose of 1 g / kg body weight therefore represents an acid load of 0.35 mEq / kg body weight.
 The total buffering capacity of whole blood in a normal individual is 45 – 50 mEq / L of blood, or 3.6 mEq / kg body weight.
 Thus, the acid load delivered with a dose of 1 g / kg of GAMUNEX - C would be neutralized by the buffering capacity of whole blood alone, even if the dose was infused instantaneously.
 The dose of GAMUNEX - C for patients with PI is 300 mg / kg to 600 mg / kg body weight (3 mL / kg to 6 mL / kg) administered every 3 to 4 weeks.
 The recommended initial infusion rate is 1 mg / kg / min (0.01 mL / kg / min).
 If the infusion is well - tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 8 mg / kg / min (0.08 mL / kg / min).
 If a patient routinely receives a dose of less than 400 mg / kg of GAMUNEX - C every 3 to 4 weeks (less than 4 mL / kg), and is at risk of measles exposure (i.e., traveling to a measles endemic area), administer a dose of at least 400 mg / kg (4 mL / kg) just prior to the expected measles exposure.
 If a patient has been exposed to measles, a dose of 400 mg / kg (4 mL / kg) should be administered as soon as possible after exposure.
 Initial SC dose (in grams) = 1.37 × previous IGIV dose (in grams) / Number of weeks between IGIV doses
 The target serum IgG trough level on weekly SC treatment is projected to be the last IGIV trough level plus 340 mg / dL.
 To adjust the dose based on trough levels, calculate the difference (in mg / dL) of the patient's serum IgG trough level from the target IgG trough level (the last IGIV trough level + 340 mg / dL).
 Table 1: Adjustment (±mL) of the Weekly Subcutaneous Dose Based on the Difference (±mg / dL) From the Target Serum IgG Trough Level
 For example, if a patient with a body weight of 70 kg has an actual IgG trough level of 900 mg / dL and the target level is 1,000 mg / dL, this results in a difference of 100 mg / dL.
 Therefore, increase the weekly dose of subcutaneous dose by 12 mL.
 GAMUNEX - C may be administered at a total dose of 2 g / kg, divided in two doses of 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) given on two consecutive days or into five doses of 0.4 g / kg (4 mL / kg) given on five consecutive days.
 If after administration of the first of two daily 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) doses, an adequate increase in the platelet count is observed at 24 hours, the second dose of 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) body weight may be withheld.
 The high dose regimen (1 g / kg × 1 - 2 days) is not recommended for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be a concern.
 The recommended initial infusion rate is 1 mg / kg / min (0.01 mL / kg / min).
 If the infusion is well - tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 8 mg / kg / min (0.08 mL / kg / min).
 GAMUNEX - C may be initially administered as a total loading dose of 2 g / kg (20 mL / kg) given in divided doses over two to four consecutive days.
 GAMUNEX - C may be administered as a maintenance infusion of 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) administered over 1 day or divided into two doses of 0.5 g / kg (5 mL / kg) given on two consecutive days, every 3 weeks.
 The recommended initial infusion rate is 2 mg / kg / min (0.02 mL / kg / min).
 If the infusion is well tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 8 mg / kg / min (0.08 mL / kg / min).
 Figure 1 to 6
 Following initial infusion (see table below), the infusion rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 0.08 mL / kg per minute (8 mg / kg per minute) as tolerated.

 The daily dose of Gengraf® Capsules (cyclosporine capsules, USP [MODIFIED]) should always be given in two divided doses (BID).
 The mean ± SD initial doses were 9±3 mg / kg / day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8±4 mg / kg / day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7±3 mg / kg / day for heart transplant patients (24 centers).
 A representative dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2.0 mg / kg / day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg / kg / day by 1 week, 0.6 mg / kg / day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg / kg / day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg / kg / day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose.
 In transplanted patients who are considered for conversion to Gengraf® from Sandimmune® (cyclosporine), Gengraf® should be started with the same daily dose as was previously used with Sandimmune® (cyclosporine) (1:1 dose conversion).
 Particular caution should be exercised when converting patients to Gengraf® at doses greater than 10 mg / kg / day.
 In this population the cyclosporine blood trough concentration should be measured more frequently, at least twice a week (daily, if initial dose exceeds 10 mg / kg / day) until the concentration stabilizes within the desired range.
 The initial dose of Gengraf® Capsules (cyclosporine capsules, USP [MODIFIED]) is 2.5 mg / kg / day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose.
 If insufficient clinical benefit is seen and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 - 0.75 mg / kg / day after 8 weeks and again after 12 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg / kg / day.
 Most patients can be treated with Gengraf® doses of 3 mg / kg / day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg / week.
 The initial dose of Gengraf® Capsules (cyclosporine capsules, USP [MODIFIED]) should be 2.5 mg / kg / day.

 It is desirable to measure periodically both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin (gentamicin injection pediatric) when feasible during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels.
 For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection) is expected to be in the range of 3 to 5 mcg / mL.
 When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg / mL are avoided.
 The usual duration of treatment is 7 to10 days.
 For intermittent intravenous administration, a single dose of Gentamicin (gentamicin injection pediatric) Injection may be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or in 5% Dextrose Injection.
 One method of dosage adjustment is to increase the interval between administration of the usual doses.
 In adults, the interval between doses (in hours) may be approximated by multiplying the serum creatinine level (mg / 100 mL) by 8.
 For example, a patient weighing 60 kg with a serum creatinine level of 2 mg / 100 mL could be given 60 mg (1 mg / kg) every 16 hours (2 x 8).
 For example, after an initial dose of 20 mg (2 mg / kg), a child weighing10 kg with a serum creatinine level of 2 mg / 100 mL could be given 10 mg every eight hours (20 x 2).
 In children, the recommended dose at the end of each dialysis period is 2 to 2.5 mg / kg depending upon the severity of the infection.
 GENVOYA is a four - drug fixed dose combination product containing 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).

 Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 20 mg to 100 mg twice daily in shortterm, placebo - controlled clinical trials.
 There were trends toward dose response within the range of 20 mg to 80 mg twice daily, but results were not consistent.
 An increase to a dose greater than 80 mg twice daily is not generally recommended.
 The safety of doses above 100 mg twice daily has not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies].
 While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with ziprasidone should remain on it, a maintenance study in patients who had been symptomatically stable and then randomized to continue ziprasidone or switch to placebo demonstrated a delay in time to relapse for patients receiving Geodon [see Clinical Studies].
 No additional benefit was demonstrated for doses above 20 mg twice daily.
 Dose Selection - Oral ziprasidone should be administered at an initial daily dose of 40 mg twice daily with food.
 The dose may then be increased to 60 mg or 80 mg twice daily on the second day of treatment and subsequently adjusted on the basis of tolerance and efficacy within the range 40 mgâ€“80 mg twice daily.

 The recommended dose of GILENYA is 0.5 mg orally once - daily.
 Fingolimod doses higher than 0.5 mg are associated with a greater incidence of adverse reactions without additional benefit.
 Since initiation of GILENYA treatment results in decreased heart rate and may prolong the QT interval, patients with a prolonged QTc interval ( > 450 msec males, > 470 msec females) before dosing or during 6 hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, congenital long - QT syndrome), or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes (e.g., citalopram, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, methadone, erythromycin) should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 Within the first 2 weeks of treatment, first dose procedures are recommended after interruption of 1 day or more; during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment first dose procedures are recommended after treatment interruption of more than 7 days.

 Bolus doses above 1 mg administered intravenously have caused nausea and vomiting and are not recommended [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The maximum recommended daily dose of GLUCOPHAGE is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 - 16 years of age); the maximum recommended daily dose of GLUCOPHAGE XR in adults is 2000 mg. GLUCOPHAGE should be given in divided doses with meals while GLUCOPHAGE XR should generally be given once daily with the evening meal.
 In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day.
 The usual starting dose of GLUCOPHAGE Tablets is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals.
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses.
 Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks.
 For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, GLUCOPHAGE may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day.
 Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given 3 times a day with meals.
 The usual starting dose of GLUCOPHAGE XR (metformin hydrochloride) Extended - Release Tablets is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal.
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal.
 If glycemic control is not achieved on GLUCOPHAGE XR 2000 mg once daily, a trial of GLUCOPHAGE XR 1000 mg twice daily should be considered.
 If higher doses of metformin are required, GLUCOPHAGE should be used at total daily doses up to 2550 mg administered in divided daily doses, as described above.
 Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving GLUCOPHAGE treatment may be safely switched to GLUCOPHAGE XR once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily.
 The usual starting dose of GLUCOPHAGE is 500 mg twice a day, given with meals.
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses.
 In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on GLUCOPHAGE 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000 / 20 mg, 1500 / 20 mg, 2000 / 20 mg, or 2500 / 20 mg of GLUCOPHAGE and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA1c, and plasma glucose response (see Clinical Studies).
 If patients have not satisfactorily responded to 1 to 3 months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of GLUCOPHAGE or GLUCOPHAGE XR and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without GLUCOPHAGE or GLUCOPHAGE XR.
 GLUCOPHAGE or GLUCOPHAGE XR therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy.
 For patients not responding adequately, the dose of GLUCOPHAGE or GLUCOPHAGE XR should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved.
 The maximum recommended daily dose is 2500 mg for GLUCOPHAGE and 2000 mg for GLUCOPHAGE XR.
 The recommended starting dose is 5 mg, given before breakfast.
 Geriatric patients or those with liver disease may be started on 2.5 mg.
 Dosage adjustments should ordinarily be in increments of 2.5 – 5 mg, as determined by blood glucose response.
 If response to a single dose is not satisfactory, dividing that dose may prove effective.
 The maximum recommended once daily dose is 15 mg. Doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided and given before meals of adequate caloric content.
 The maximum recommended total daily dose is 40 mg.
 Total daily doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided.
 Total daily doses above 30 mg have been safely given on a b.i.d.
 For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin may be discontinued and GLUCOTROL therapy may begin at usual dosages.
 In some cases, especially when patient has been receiving greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider hospitalization during the transition period.
 The recommended starting dose of GLUCOTROL XL is 5 mg once daily.
 the elderly or patients with hepatic insufficiency) at 2.5 mg [see Use in Specific Population].
 The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg once daily.
 When adding GLUCOTROL XL to other anti - diabetic drugs, initiate GLUCOTROL XL at 5 mg once daily.
 Dosage of GLUCOVANCE must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dos e of 20 mg glyburide / 2000 mg metformin.
 Recommended starting dose: 1.25 mg / 250 mg once or twice daily with meals.
 For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of GLUCOVANCE is 1.25 mg / 250 mg once a day with a meal.
 As initial therapy in patients with baseline HbA1c > 9% or an FPG > 200 mg / dL, a starting dose of GLUCOVANCE 1.25 mg / 250 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals may be used.
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of 1.25 mg / 250 mg per day every 2 weeks up to the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.
 In clinical trials of GLUCOVANCE as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses > 10 mg / 2000 mg per day.
 GLUCOVANCE 5 mg / 500 mg should not be used as initial therapy due to an increased risk of hypoglycemia.
 Recommended starting dose: 2.5 mg / 500 mg or 5 mg / 500 mg twice daily with meals.
 For patients not adequately controlled on either glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of GLUCOVANCE is 2.5 mg / 500 mg or 5 mg / 500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals.
 The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg / 500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg / 2000 mg per day.
 The dosage of GLUMETZA must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 2000 mg.
 The starting dose of GLUMETZA in patients who are not currently taking metformin is 500 mg once daily, with the evening meal.
 The dose can be uptitrated in 500 mg increments no sooner than every 1 - 2 weeks if a higher dose of GLUMETZA is needed and there are no gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
 If GLUMETZA is considered appropriate for a patient already receiving immediate - release metformin, the patient can be switched to GLUMETZA once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily.
 Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of GLUMETZA 500 mg may be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass, while the 1000 mg may leave an insoluble shell that may resemble the original tablet.
 If a dose of GLUMETZA is missed, patients should be cautioned against taking two doses of 2000 mg the same day.
 The presently recommended maximum daily dosage of glycopyrrolate is 8 mg.
 The recommended initial dosage of Glycopyrrolate 1 mg tablets for adults is one tablet three times daily (in the morning, early afternoon, and at bedtime).
 Some patients may require two tablets at bedtime to assure overnight control of symptoms.
 For maintenance, a dosage of one tablet twice a day is frequently adequate.
 The recommended dosage of Glycopyrrolate 2 mg tablets for adults is one tablet two or three times daily at equally spaced intervals.
 The Glycopyrrolate 1.5 mg tablets may be used to provide intermediate titration doses based on response of the patient.
 The suggested starting dose of GLYNASE PresTab is 1.5 to 3 mg daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal.
 Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 0.75 mg daily.
 The initial daily dose should be 1.5 to 3 mg.
 If the insulin dose is less than 20 units daily, substitution of GLYNASE PresTab 1.5 to 3 mg as a single daily dose may be tried.
 If the insulin dose is between 20 and 40 units daily, the patient may be placed directly on GLYNASE PresTab Tablets 3 mg daily as a single dose.
 If the insulin dose is more than 40 units daily, a transition period is required for conversion to GLYNASE PresTab.
 In these patients, insulin dosage is decreased by 50% and GLYNASE PresTab Tablets 3 mg daily is started.
 The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 0.75 to 12 mg daily, which may be given as a single dose or in divided doses (See Dosage Interval Section).
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 1.5 mg at weekly intervals based upon the patient's blood glucose response.
 Although patients may be transferred from the maximum dose of other sulfonylureas, the maximum starting dose of 3 mg of GLYNASE PresTab Tablets should be observed.
 A maintenance dose of 3 mg of GLYNASE PresTab Tablets provides approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 to 375 mg chlorpropamide, 250 to 375 mg tolazamide, 5 mg of glyburide (nonmicronized tablets), 500 to 750 mg acetohexamide, or 1000 to 1500 mg tolbutamide.
 When transferring patients receiving more than 40 units of insulin daily, they may be started on a daily dose of GLYNASE PresTab Tablets 3 mg concomitantly with a 50% reduction in insulin dose.
 Progressive withdrawal of insulin and increase of GLYNASE PresTab in increments of 0.75 to 1.5 mg every 2 to 10 days is then carried out.
 Daily doses of more than 12 mg are not recommended.
 Some patients, particularly those receiving more than 6 mg daily, may have a more satisfactory response with twice - a - day dosage.
 Dosage of GLYSET must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dosage of 100 mg 3 times daily.
 GLYSET should be started at 25 mg, and the dosage gradually increased both to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.
 The recommended starting dosage of GLYSET is 25 mg, given orally three times daily at the start of each main meal.
 However, some patients may benefit by starting at 25 mg once daily to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects, and gradually increasing the frequency of administration to 3 times daily.
 The usual maintenance dose of GLYSET is 50 mg taken 3 times daily, although some patients may benefit from increasing the dose to 100 mg 3 times daily.
 To allow adaptation to potential gastrointestinal adverse effects, it is recommended that GLYSET therapy be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg 3 times daily, then gradually titrated upward to allow adaptation.
 After 4 to 8 weeks of the 25 mg 3 times daily regimen, the dosage should be increased to 50 mg 3 times daily for approximately three months, following which a glycosylated hemoglobin level should be measured to assess therapeutic response.
 If at that time, the glycosylated hemoglobin level is not satisfactory, the dosage may be further increased to 100 mg 3 times daily, the maximum recommended dosage.
 If no further reduction in postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels is observed with titration to 100 mg 3 times daily, consideration should be given to lowering the dose.
 The maximum recommended dosage of GLYSET is 100 mg 3 times daily.
 In one clinical trial, 200 mg 3 times daily gave additional improved glycemic control but increased the incidence of the gastrointestinal symptoms described above.
 The recommended dose of GLYXAMBI is 10 mg empagliflozin / 5 mg linagliptin once daily in the morning, taken with or without food.
 In patients tolerating GLYXAMBI, the dose may be increased to 25 mg empagliflozin / 5 mg linagliptin once daily.
 The 1 gallon reconstituted GoLYTELY solution contains: 227.1 grams of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 21.5 grams sodium sulfate (anhydrous), 6.36 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 5.53 grams of sodium chloride, and 2.82 grams of potassium chloride.
 The solution is more palatable if chilled prior to administration.
 Each Gonal - f® Multi - Dose Vial delivers 450 IU or 1050 IU follitropin alfa, respectively.
 Over the course of treatment, doses of Gonal - f® may range up to 300 IU per day depending on the individual patient response.
 It is recommended that the initial dose of the first cycle be 75 IU of Gonal - f® per day, ADMINISTERED SUBCUTANEOUSLY.
 To complete follicular development and effect ovulation in the absence of an endogenous LH surge, chorionic gonadotropin, hCG, (5,000 USP units) should be given 1 day after the last dose of Gonal - f® .
 As in the initial cycle, 5,000 USP units of hCG must be given 1 day after the last dose of Gonal - f® to complete follicular development and induce ovulation.
 For Assisted Reproductive Technologies, therapy with Gonal - f® should be initiated in the early follicular phase (cycle day 2 or 3) at a dose of 150 IU per day, until sufficient follicular development is attained.
 In patients undergoing ART, whose endogenous gonadotropin levels are suppressed, Gonal - f® should be initiated at a dose of 225 IU per day.
 Adjustments to dose may be considered after five days based on the patient's response; subsequently dosage should be adjusted no more frequently than every 3 - 5 days and by no more than 75 - 150 IU additionally at each adjustment.
 Once adequate follicular development is evident, hCG (5,000 to 10,000 USP units) should be administered to induce final follicular maturation in preparation for oocyte retrieval.
 Prior to concomitant therapy with Gonal - f® and hCG, pretreatment with hCG alone (1,000 to 2,250 USP units two to three times per week) is required.
 Such pretreatment may require 3 to 6 months and the dose of hCG may need to be increased to achieve normal serum testosterone levels.
 After normal serum testosterone levels are reached, the recommended dose of Gonal - f® is 150 IU administered subcutaneously three times a week and the recommended dose of hCG is 1,000 USP units (or the dose required to maintain serum testosterone levels within the normal range) three times a week.

 Following reconstitution as directed, product will deliver the equivalent of fourteen 75 IU doses.
 The 27 - gauge injection syringe (see figure below) has unit dose markings from 37.5 IU to 600 IU FSH for use with Gonal - f® Multi - Dose.
 Over the course of treatment, doses of Gonal - f® RFF (follitropin alfa injection) may range up to 300 IU per day depending on the individual patient response.
 It is recommended that the initial dose of the first cycle be 75 IU of Gonal - f® RFF (follitropin alfa injection) per day, ADMINISTERED SUBCUTANEOUSLY.
 For Assisted Reproductive Technologies, therapy with Gonal - f® RFF should be initiated in the early follicular phase (cycle day 2 or 3) at a dose of 150 IU per day, until sufficient follicular development is attained.
 In patients undergoing ART under 35 years old, whose endogenous gonadotropin levels are suppressed, Gonal - f® RFF (follitropin alfa injection) should be initiated at a dose of 150 IU per day.
 In patients 35 years old and older whose endogenous gonadotropin levels are suppressed, Gonal - f® RFF (follitropin alfa injection) should be initiated at a dose of 225 IU per day.
 Dissolve the contents of one or more single - dose vials of Gonal - f® RFF in 1.0 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (concentration should not exceed 450 IU / mL) and ADMINISTER SUBCUTANEOUSLY immediately.
 Administer one or two packets (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per packet) at the onset of an attack under the tongue.
 One additional packet may be administered every five minutes as needed.
 GONITRO may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.
 Titrate GRALISE to an 1800 mg dose taken orally once daily with the evening meal.
 For females CCr=(0.85)(140 - age)(weight) / [(72)(SCr)]
 For males CCr=(140 - age)(weight) / [(72)(SCr)]
 Patients with reduced renal function must initiate GRALISE at a daily dose of 300 mg. GRALISE should be titrated following the schedule outlined in Table 1.
 The recommended dose of GRANIX is 5 mcg / kg per day administered as a subcutaneous injection.
 One GRASTEK tablet daily.
 Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.
 Children:Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children.
 Children weighing 30 to 50 pounds - 125 mg to 250 mg daily.
 Children weighing over 50 pounds - 250mg to 500 mg daily.
 Gris - PEG® tablets may be swallowed whole or crushed and sprinkled onto 1 tablespoonful of applesauce and swallowed immediately without chewing.
 Daily administration of 375 mg (as a single dose or in divided doses) will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.
 For those fungal infections more difficult to eradicate, such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a divided dose of 750 mg is recommended.
 Approximately 7.3 mg per kg of body weight per day of ultramicrosize griseofulvin is an effective dose for most pediatric patients.
 On this basis, the following dosage schedule is suggested: 16 - 27 kg: 125 mg to 187.5 mg daily.
 over 27 kg: 187.5 mg to 375 mg daily
 Adults and pediatric patients over 12 years of age: One or two tablets every 12 hours not to exceed 4 tablets in 24 hours.
 Pediatric patients 6 to 12 years: 1 tablet every 12 hours not to exceed 2 tablets in 24 hours.
 Pediatric patients 2 to 6 years: ½ tablet every 12 hours not to exceed 1 tablet in 24 hours.
 The recommended initial dose of guanfacine (as the hydrochloride) when given alone or in combination with another antihypertensive drug is 1 mg daily given at bedtime to minimize somnolence.
 If after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, 1 mg does not give a satisfactory result, a dose of 2 mg may be given, although most of the effect of guanfacine is seen at 1 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 Higher daily doses have been used, but adverse reactions increase significantly with doses above 3 mg / day.
 The recommended dose of GYNAZOLE•1® Butoconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP, 2% is one applicatorful of cream (approximately 5 grams of the cream) intravaginally.
 This amount of cream contains approximately 100 mg of butoconazole nitrate.
 Fill the applicator with the cream and then insert one applicatorful of cream into the vagina every day, preferably at bedtime.
 The recommended dose of HALAVEN is 1.4 mg / m² administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle.
 The recommended dose of HALAVEN in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh A) is 1.1 mg / m² administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle [see Use in Specific Populations].
 The recommended dose of HALAVEN in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh B) is 0.7 mg / m² administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle [see Use in Specific Populations].
 The recommended dose of HALAVEN in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 - 49 mL / min) is 1.1 mg / m² administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 - day cycle [see Use in Specific Populations].
 Aseptically withdraw the required amount of HALAVEN from the single - use vial and administer undiluted or diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 The recommended dose for most adults is 0.25 mg before retiring.
 A dose of 0.125 mg may be found to be sufficient for some patients (e.g., low body weight).
 A dose of 0.5 mg should be used only for exceptional patients who do not respond adequately to a trial of a lower dose since the risk of several adverse reactions increases with the size of the dose administered.
 A dose of 0.5 mg should not be exceeded.
 In geriatric and / or debilitated patients the recommended dosage range is 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg.
 Therapy should be initiated at 0.125 mg in these groups and the 0.25 mg dose should be used only for exceptional patients who do not respond to a trial of the lower dose.
 A dose of 0.25 mg should not be exceeded in these patients.
 Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms.
 The maximum dose is 20 mg / day.

 Step 2
 Position the thumb so that it covers the colored point and is parallel to the colored ring(s).
 The maximum volume per injection site should not exceed 3 mL.
 HALDOL Decanoate (haloperidol decanoate) 50 and HALDOL Decanoate (haloperidol decanoate) 100 are intended for use in schizophrenic patients who require prolonged parenteral antipsychotic therapy.
 The dose of HALDOL Decanoate (haloperidol decanoate) 50 or HALDOL Decanoate (haloperidol decanoate) 100 should be expressed in terms of its haloperidol content.
 up to the equivalent of 10 mg / day oral haloperidol), it is recommended that the initial dose of haloperidol decanoate be 10 - 15 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents; limited clinical experience suggests that lower initial doses may be adequate.
 Conversion from oral haloperidol to haloperidol decanoate can be achieved by using an initial dose of haloperidol decanoate that is 10 to 20 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents.
 up to the equivalent of 10 mg / day oral haloperidol), a range of 10 to 15 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents is appropriate for initial conversion.
 The initial dose of haloperidol decanoate should not exceed 100 mg regardless of previous antipsychotic dose requirements.
 If, therefore, conversion requires more than 100 mg of haloperidol decanoate as an initial dose, that dose should be administered in two injections, i.e.
 a maximum of 100 mg initially followed by the balance in 3 to 7 days.
 The usual maintenance range is 10 to 15 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents dependent on the clinical response of the patient.
 Clinical experience with haloperidol decanoate at doses greater than 450 mg per month has been limited.
 The total daily oral dose may be administered singly or in divided (three or four) doses.
 Male hypogonadism: For complete replacement in the hypogonadal male, a daily dose of 5 to 20 mg will suffice in the majority of patients.
 Inoperable carcinoma of the breast in the female: The recommended total daily dose for palliative therapy in advanced inoperable carcinoma of the breast is 10 to 40 mg. Because of its short action, fluoxymesterone should be administered to patients in divided, rather than single, daily doses to ensure more stable blood levels.
 The recommended dosage of HARVONI is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Table 1 shows the recommended HARVONI treatment regimen and duration based on patient population.
 Table 1 : Recommended Treatment Regimen and Duration for HARVONI in Patients with Genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 HCV
 Primary immunization for children and adolescents (12 months through 18 years of age) consists of a single 0.5 - mL dose and a 0.5 - mL booster dose administered anytime between 6 and 12 months later.
 Primary immunization for adults consists of a single 1 - mL dose and a 1 - mL booster dose administered anytime between 6 and 12 months later.
 Store at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).
 The recommended initial dose of Hectorol (doxercalciferol liquid filled capsule) is 10 mcg administered three times weekly at dialysis (approximately every other day).
 The initial dose should be adjusted, as needed, in order to lower blood iPTH into the range of 150 to 300 pg / mL.
 The maximum recommended dose of Hectorol (doxercalciferol liquid filled capsule) is 20 mcg administered three times a week at dialysis for a total of 60 mcg per week.
 Drug administration should be suspended if iPTH falls below 100 pg / mL and restarted one week later at a dose that is at least 2.5 mcg lower than the last administered dose.
 If suspended, the drug should be restarted at a dose that is at least 2.5 mcg lower.
 The recommended initial dose of Hectorol (doxercalciferol liquid filled capsule) is 1 mcg administered once daily.
 The maximum recommended dose of Hectorol (doxercalciferol liquid filled capsule) is 3.5 mcg administered once per day.
 The recommended initial dose of Hectorol is 4 mcg administered intravenously as a bolus dose three times weekly at the end of dialysis (approximately every other day).
 The initial dose should be adjusted, as needed, in order to lower blood iPTH into the range of 150 to 300 pg / mL.
 Drug administration should be suspended if iPTH falls below 100 pg / mL and restarted one week later at a dose that is at least 1 mcg lower than the last administered dose.
 If hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or a serum calcium times phosphorus product greater than 55 mg 2 / d2L is noted, the dose of Hectorol should be decreased or suspended and / or the dose of phosphate binders should be appropriately adjusted.
 If suspended, the drug should be restarted at a dose that is 1 mcg lower.
 Table 5 presents a suggested approach in dose titration.
 Adults: The recommended dosages are: bismuth subsalicylate, 525 mg (two 262.4 mg - chewable tablets), metronidazole, 250 mg (one 250 - mg tablet), and tetracycline hydrochloride, 500 mg (one 500 - mg capsule) taken four times daily for 14 days plus an H2 antagonist approved for the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer.
 If more than 4 doses are missed, the prescriber should be contacted.
 The rate of administration should be adapted to the response of the individual patient, but administration of the entire dose in 5 to 10 minutes or less is well tolerated.
 An initial dose of 1 mL of HEMABATE Sterile Solution (containing the equivalent of 250 micrograms of carboprost) is to be administered deep in the muscle with a tuberculin syringe.
 An optional test dose of 100 micrograms (0.4 mL) may be administered initially.
 The dose may be increased to 500 micrograms (2 mL) if uterine contractility is judged to be inadequate after several doses of 250 micrograms (1 mL).
 An initial dose of 250 micrograms of HEMABATE Sterile Solution (1 mL of HEMABATE) is to be given deep, intramuscularly.
 In clinical trials it was found that the majority of successful cases (73%) responded to single injections.
 The total dose of HEMABATE should not exceed 2 milligrams (8 doses).
 Initiate treatment at age 5 weeks to 5 months.
 The recommended starting dose of HEMANGEOL is 0.15 mL / kg (0.6 mg / kg) (see Table 1) twice daily, taken at least 9 hours apart.
 After 1 week, increase the daily dose to 0.3 mL / kg (1.1 mg / kg) twice daily.
 After 2 weeks of treatment, increase the dose to 0.4 mL / kg (1.7 mg / kg) twice daily and maintain this for 6 months.
 Based upon the HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) clinical trial, patients should receive 20,000 lU / dose [see Clinical Trials in Liver Transplant Patients].
 Table 1 - HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) Dosing Regimen
 * Each dose should contain 20,000 IU calculated from the measured potency as stamped on the vial label [see Dosage Forms and Strengths].
 HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) dose adjustments may be required in patients who fail to reach anti - HBs levels of 500 IU / L within the first week post - liver transplantation.4 Patients who have surgical bleeding or abdominal fluid drainage (> 500 mL) or patients who undergo plasmapheresis are particularly susceptible to extensive loss of circulated anti - HBs.
 In these cases, the dosing regimen should be increased to a half - dose (10,000 IU calculated from the measured potency as stamped on the vial label) intravenously every 6 hours until the target anti - HBs is reached.
 The rate of administration should be set at 2 mL per minute.
 The rate of infusion should be decreased to 1 mL per minute or slower if the patient develops discomfort, infusion - related adverse events or there is concern about the speed of infusion.
 It is important to use a separate vial, sterile syringe, and needle for each individual patient, to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one person to another.
 For greatest effectiveness, passive prophylaxis with HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) should be given as soon as possible after exposure, as its value after seven days following exposure is unclear.1 - 2 An injection of 0.06 mL / kg of body weight should be administered intramuscularly as soon as possible after exposure, and within 24 hours if possible.
 Table 2 - Recommendations for Hepatitis B Prophylaxis Following Percutaneous or Permucosal Exposure1,2
 Infants born to mothers known to be HBsAg - positive should receive 0.5 mL HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) after physiologic stabilization of the infant and preferably within 12 hours of birth.
 If the mother is later found to be HBsAg - positive, the infant should receive 0.5 mL HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) as soon as possible and within seven days of birth; however, the efficacy of HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) administered after 48 hours of age is not known.6 Testing for HBsAg and anti - HBs is recommended at 12 - 15 months of age.
 All susceptible persons whose sexual partners have acute hepatitis B infection should receive a single dose of HepaGam B™ (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human]) (0.06 mL / kg) and should begin the Hepatitis B Vaccine series, if not contraindicated, within 14 days of the last sexual contact or if sexual contact with the infected person will continue.
 Prophylaxis of an infant less than 12 months of age with 0.5 mL HepaGam B (hepatitis b immune globulin (human)) and Hepatitis B Vaccine is indicated if the mother or primary caregiver has acute HBV infection.
 Heparin sodium is not effective by oral administration and should be given by intermittent intravenous injection, after dilution in 50 or 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or by intravenous infusion.
 Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value.
 To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range.

 Following administration of Sodium Iodide I - 131, about 40 percent of the activity has an effective half - life of 0.34 days and 60 percent has an effective half - life of 7.61 days.
 On this basis, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to an average adult (70 kg) from an oral dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of Sodium Iodide I - 131 is shown in Table 4.
 The kit includes one large gelatin capsule and one small gelatin capsule for each dose prepared.
 Each large capsule is empty and each small capsule contains approximately 300 mg of Dibasic Sodium Phosphate Anhydrous USP as the absorbing buffer.
 Open one LARGE capsule by pulling apart the capsule into two pieces as illustrated below:
 With an appropriate syringe, withdraw the required volume of Sodium Iodide I 131 Solution USP (maximum 150 μL) from the vial as illustrated below:
 1 tablet (1.0 g) twice daily (morning and night) for adults and pediatric patients over 12 years of age.
 ½ to 1 tablet (0.5 to 1.0 g) twice daily (morning and night) for pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age.
 The recommended dosage for adults and children 12 years of age and older is 10 mg (1 tablet) once daily.
 Adults and pediatric patients over 12 years - 2 teaspoonsful (10 mL) every 4 hours, not to exceed 8 teaspoonsful in 24 hours.
 Pediatric patients 6 to 12 years - 1 teaspoonful (5 mL) every 4 hours, not to exceed 4 teaspoonsful in 24 hours.
 The recommended regimen is one 0.750 mg tablet of HIVID (zalcitabine) orally every 8 hours (2.25 mg HIVID (zalcitabine) total daily dose) in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
 Based on preliminary data, the recommended HIVID (zalcitabine) dosage reduction for patients with impaired renal function is: creatinine clearance 10 to 40 mL / min: 0.750 mg of HIVID (zalcitabine) every 12 hours; creatinine clearance < 10 mL / min: 0.750 mg of HIVID (zalcitabine) every 24 hours.
 HIVID (zalcitabine) should be reintroduced at 50% dose — 0.375 mg every 8 hours only if all findings related to peripheral neuropathy have improved to mild symptoms.
 Significant toxicities, such as anemia (hemoglobin of < 7.5 gm / dL or reduction of > 25% of baseline) and / or granulocytopenia (granulocyte count of < 750 cells / mm3 or reduction of > 50% from baseline), may require a treatment interruption of HIVID (zalcitabine) and zidovudine until evidence of marrow recovery is observed.
 For frequent dosing, add the weekly increment from Table 1 to the weekly - equivalent dose and then divide by the number of days of dosing.
 For example, if a patient with a body weight of 70 kg has an actual IgG trough level of 900 mg / dL and the target trough level is 1000 mg / dL, this results in a difference of 100 mg / dL.
 Therefore, increase the weekly dose of Hizentra by 10 mL.
 For biweekly dosing, increase the biweekly dose by 20 mL.
 For 2 times per week dosing, increase the dose by 5 mL.
 Administer a minimum total weekly Hizentra dose of 200 mg / kg body weight for two consecutive weeks if a patient is at risk of measles exposure (i.e., due to an outbreak in the US or travel to endemic areas outside of the US.
 For biweekly dosing, one infusion of a minimum of 400 mg / kg is recommended.
 Instill one drop in the conjunctival sac up to every four hours.
 The recommended dosage for HORIZANT is 600 mg once daily at about 5 PM.
 A daily dose of 1,200 mg provided no additional benefit compared with the 600 - mg dose, but caused an increase in adverse reactions [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The recommended dosage of HORIZANT is 600 mg twice daily.
 HORIZANT should be initiated at a dose of 600 mg in the morning for 3 days of therapy, then increased to 600 mg twice daily (1,200 mg / day) on day four.
 In the 12 - week principal efficacy study, additional benefit of using doses greater than 1,200 mg a day was not demonstrated, and these higher doses resulted in an increase in adverse reactions [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 for males: CrCl = (140 - age)(weight) / [(72)(SCr)]
 for females: CrCl = (0.85)(140 - age)(weight) / [(72)(SCr)]

 aRecent literature has recommended initial treatment with larger doses of somatropin (e.g., 0.067 mg / kg / day), especially in very short children (i.e., height SDS < – 3), and / or older pubertal children, and that a reduction in dosage (e.g., gradually towards 0.033 mg / kg / day) should be considered if substantial catch - up growth is observed during the first few years of therapy.
 On the other hand, in younger SGA children (e.g., approximately < 4 years) (who respond the best in general) with less severe short stature (i.e., baseline height SDS values between - 2 and - 3), consideration should be given to initiating treatment at a lower dose (e.g., 0.033 mg / kg / day), and titrating the dose as needed over time.
 based on published consensus guidelines, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg / day (range, 0.15 - 0.30 mg / day) may be used without consideration of body weight.
 based on the dosing regimen used in the original adult GH deficiency registration trials, the recommended dosage at the start of treatment is not more than 0.006 mg / kg (6 μg / kg) daily.
 The dose may be increased according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.0125 mg / kg (12.5 μg / kg) daily.
 The recommended dose of HUMIRA for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is 40 mg administered every other week.

 Only administer one dose per vial.
 For initial therapy with HUMORSOL (demecarium) (0.125 percent or 0.25 percent) place 1 drop (children) or 1 or 2 drops (adults) in the glaucomatous eye.
 The usual dosage can vary from as much as 1 or 2 drops twice a day to as little as 1 or 2 drops twice a week.
 One drop is given daily for 2 weeks, then 1 drop every 2 days for 2 to 3 weeks.
 In esotropia uncomplicated by amblyopia or anisometropia, HUMORSOL (demecarium) may be instilled in both eyes, not more than 1 drop at a time every day for 2 to 3 weeks, as too severe a degree of miosis may interfere with vision.
 Then reduce the dosage to 1 drop every other day for 3 to 4 weeks and reevaluate the patient's status.
 HUMORSOL (demecarium) may be continued in a dosage of 1 drop every 2 days to 1 drop twice a week.
 If improvement continues, change the schedule to 1 drop once a week and eventually to a trial without medication.
 However, if after 4 months, control of the condition still requires 1 drop every 2 days, therapy with HUMORSOL (demecarium) should be stopped.

 Usual Adult Dose: One teaspoonful (5 mL) after meals and at bedtime, not less than 4 hours apart (not to exceed 6 teaspoonfuls in a 24 hour period).
 Treatment should be initiated with one teaspoonful and subsequent doses, up to a maximum single dose of 3 teaspoonfuls, adjusted if required.
 Over 12 years: Initial dose 1 teaspoonful; maximum single dose, 2 teaspoonfuls.
 6 to 12 years: Initial dose 1 / 2 teaspoonful; maximum single dose, 1 teaspoonful.
 Absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs may be enhanced by adding 50 to 300 Units, most typically 150 Units of hyaluronidase, to the injection solution.
 150 Units will facilitate absorption of 1,000 mL or more of solution.
 Hydase™ may be added to small volumes of solution (up to 200 mL), such as small clysis for infants or solutions of drugs for subcutaneous injection.
 For infants and children less than 3 years old, the volume of a single clysis should be limited to 200 mL; and in premature infants or during the neonatal period, the daily dosage should not exceed 25 mL / kg of body weight; the rate of administration should not be greater than 2 mL per minute.
 With the patient prone, 75 Units of Hydase™ (hyaluronidase injection) is injected subcutaneously over each scapula, followed by injection of the contrast medium at the same sites.
 Inject 150 U of HYLENEX recombinant prior to start of subcutaneous fluid administration to facilitate absorption of up to 1,000 mL or more of solution.
 For premature infants or during the neonatal period, the daily dosage should not exceed 25 mL / kg and the rate of administration should not be greater than 2 mL per minute.
 If Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) is indicated (see Table 1), an injection of 0.06 mL / kg of body weight should be administered intramuscularly (see PRECAUTIONS) as soon as possible after exposure and within 24 hours, if possible.
 Table 1: (adapted from 20) Recommendations for Hepatitis B Prophylaxis Following Percutaneous or Permucosal Exposure
 Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) (0.5 mL) should be administered intramuscularly (IM) to the newborn infant after physiologic stabilization of the infant and preferably within 12 hours of birth.
 Hepatitis B Vaccine should be administered IM in three doses of 0.5 mL of vaccine (10 μg) each.
 If administration of the first dose of Hepatitis B Vaccine is delayed for as long as 3 months, then a 0.5 mL dose of Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) should be repeated at 3 months.
 All susceptible persons whose sex partners have acute hepatitis B infection should receive a single dose of HBIG (0.06 mL / kg) and should begin the hepatitis B vaccine series if prophylaxis can be started within 14 days of the last sexual contact or if sexual contact with the infected person will continue (see Table 2 below).
 Table 2: (adapted from21) Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis for Sexual Exposure to Hepatitis B
 Prophylactic treatment with a 0.5 mL dose of Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) and hepatitis B vaccine is indicated for infants 12 months of age who have been exposed to a primary care - giver who has acute hepatitis B. Prophylaxis for other household contacts of persons with acute HBV infection is not indicated unless they have had identifiable blood exposure to the index patient, such as by sharing toothbrushes or razors.
 The recommended dose for HyperRAB S / D is 20 IU / kg (0.133 mL / kg) of body weight given preferably at the time of the first vaccine dose.8,9 It may also be given through the seventh day after the first dose of vaccine is given.
 Rabies postexposure prophylaxis schedule—United States, 199919
 The half - life of IgG is 23 to 26 days.
 If delivery occurs within 3 weeks after the last dose, the postpartum dose may be withheld unless there is a fetomaternal hemorrhage in excess of 15 mL of red blood cells.
 (16)
 The volume of red blood cells is divided by 15 mL which provides the number of syringes of HyperRHO S / D Full Dose to be administered.
 If the dose calculated results in a fraction, the next higher whole number of syringes should be administered (e.g., if 1.4, give 2 syringes).
 (17)
 Single Syringe Dose
 One syringe of HyperRHO S / D Mini - Dose provides sufficient antibody to prevent Rh sensitization to 2.5 mL Rho(D) positive packed red cells or the equivalent (5 mL) of whole blood.
 Adults and children 7 years and older: HyperTET S / D, 250 units should be given by deep intramuscular injection (see PRECAUTIONS).
 Children less than 7 years old: In small children the routine prophylactic dose of HyperTET S / D may be calculated by the body weight (4.0 units / kg).
 However, it may be advisable to administer the entire contents of the syringe of HyperTET S / D (250 units) regardless of the child's size, since theoretically thesame amount of toxin will be produced in the child's body by the infecting tetanus organism as it will in an adult's body.
 The physician must impress upon the patient the need for further toxoid injections in 1 month and 1 year.
 Persons who have received at least two doses of tetanus toxoid rapidly develop antibodies.2 The prophylactic dosage schedule for these patients and for those with incomplete or uncertain immunity is shown on the table in INDICATIONS AND USAGE.
 Administer HYQVIA at 300 to 600 mg / kg at 3 to 4 week intervals, after initial ramp - up.
 Example 1: A patient with a body weight of 80 kg has a measured IgG trough level of 800 mg / dL and the reference trough level is 1000 mg / dL.
 The trough level difference is 200 mg / dL (1000 mg / dL minus 800 mg / dL).
 The dose of HYQVIA would be increased by 48 mL (4.8 grams) per dosing interval.
 Example 2: A patient with a body weight of 60 kg has a measured IgG trough level of 1000 mg / dL and the reference trough level is 900 mg / dL.
 The trough level difference is - 100 mg / dL (900 mg / dL minus 1000 mg / dL).
 The dose of HYQVIA would be decreased by 18 mL (1.8 grams) per dosing interval.
 Example: When adjusting a dose of 30 grams administered every 3 weeks; administer 40 grams of HYQVIA every 4 weeks.
 Evaluate the use ofa second site or infusing at shorter intervals when the volume of HYQVIA is greater than 600 mL.
 Administer up to 600 mL per site for patients greater than or equal to 40 kg and up to 300 mL per site for patients less than 40 kg.
 Administer the Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase of HYQVIA at an initial rate per site of approximately 1 to 2 mL per minute, or as tolerated.
 Start at a rate of 1 to 2 mL per minute per site and increase as tolerated.
 Daily doses of HYSINGLA ER greater than or equal to 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Instruct patients to swallow HYSINGLA ER tablets whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
 Initiate therapy with HYSINGLA ER 20 mg orally every 24 hours.
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is HYSINGLA ER 20 mg orally every 24 hours.
 To obtain the initial HYSINGLA ER dose, first use Table 1 to convert the prior oral opioids to a total hydrocodone daily dose and then reduce the calculated daily hydrocodone dose by 25% to account for interpatient variability in relative potency of different opioids.
 If the converted HYSINGLA ER dose using Table 1 is less than 20 mg, initiate therapy with HYSINGLA ER 20 mg.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to HYSINGLA ER: For example, a total daily dose of oxycodone 50 mg would be converted to hydrocodone 50 mg based on the table above, and then multiplied by 0.75 (ie, take a 25 % reduction) resulting in a dose of 37.5 mg hydrocodone.
 Round this down to the nearest dose strength available, HYSINGLA ER 30 mg, to initiate therapy.
 For each 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch, a dose of HYSINGLA ER 20 mg every 24 hours represents a conservative initial dose.
 All patients receiving transdermal buprenorphine ( ≤ 20 mcg / hr) should initiate therapy with HYSINGLA ER 20 mg every 24 hours.
 Adjust the dose of HYSINGLA ER in increments of 10 mg to 20 mg every 3 to 5 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia.
 Initiate therapy with one half the initial dose of HYSINGLA ER in these patients and monitor closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Initiate therapy with one half the initial dose of HYSINGLA ER in these patients and monitor closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 After reaching HYSINGLA ER 20 mg dose for 2 to 4 days, HYSINGLA ER can be discontinued.
 1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not be exceeded as an initial dose.
 The dose should be increased in a stepwise fashion to 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg once daily to achieve the desired improvement of symptoms and / or flow rates.
 Doses of 10 mg once daily are generally required for the clinical response.
 Therefore, treatment with 10 mg for a minimum of 4 – 6 weeks may be required to assess whether a beneficial response has been achieved.
 Although some additional patients responded at a 20 mg daily dose, there was an insufficient number of patients studied to draw definitive conclusions about this dose.
 There are insufficient data to support the use of higher doses for those patients who show inadequate or no response to 20 mg daily.
 The dose of HYTRIN (terazosin hcl) and the dose interval (12 or 24 hours) should be adjusted according to the patient's individual blood pressure response.
 1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not be exceeded.
 The usual recommended dose range is 1 mg to 5 mg administered once a day; however, some patients may benefit from doses as high as 20 mg per day.
 Doses over 20 mg do not appear to provide further blood pressure effect and doses over 40 mg have not been studied.
 The usual starting dose of HYZAAR is 50 / 12.5 (losartan 50 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily.
 The dosage can be increased after 3 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 100 / 25 (losartan 100 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies].
 Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 50 mg monotherapy with HYZAAR 50 / 12.5 once daily.
 If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to two tablets of HYZAAR 50 / 12.5 once daily or one tablet of HYZAAR 100 / 25 once daily.
 Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 100 mg monotherapy with HYZAAR 100 / 12.5 (losartan 100 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily.
 If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of HYZAAR 50 / 12.5 once daily or one tablet of HYZAAR 100 / 25 once daily.
 Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on HYZAAR 50 / 12.5 once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.
 Evaluate the clinical response to HYZAAR 50 / 12.5 and, if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of HYZAAR 50 / 12.5 once daily or one tablet of HYZAAR 100 / 25 once daily.
 In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on 50 mg losartan potassium, initiate treatment with HYZAAR 50 / 12.5.
 The recommended dose of IBRANCE is a 125 mg capsule taken orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days.
 When coadministered with palbociclib, the recommended dose of letrozole is 2.5 mg taken once daily continuously throughout the 28 - day cycle.
 When coadministered with palbociclib, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter.
 If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg once daily.
 In the performance of dye dilution curves, a known amount of dye is usually injected as a single bolus as rapidly as possible via a cardiac catheter into selected sites in the vascular system.
 Adults - 5.0 mg Children - 2.5 mg Infants - 1.25 mg
 The total dose of dye injected should be kept below 2 mg / kg.
 The most concentrated dye solution is made by accurately diluting 1 mL of the 5 mg / mL dye with 7 mL of distilled water.
 This concentration is then successively halved by diluting 4 mL of the previous concentration with 4 mL of distilled water.
 If a 2.5 mg / mL concentration was used for the dilution curves, 1 mL of the 2.5 mg / mL dye is added to 3 mL of distilled water to make the most concentrated “standard” solution.
 This concentration is then successively halved by diluting 2 mL of the previous concentration with 2 mL of distilled water.
 Then 0.2 mL portions (accurately measured from a calibrated syringe) of these dye solutions are added to 5 mL aliquots of the subject's blood, giving final concentrations of the dye in blood beginning with 24.0 mg / liter, approximately (actual concentration depends on the exact volume of dye added).
 These aliquots of blood containing known amounts of dye, as well as a blank sample of which 0.2 mL of saline containing no dye has been added, are then passed through the detecting instrument and a calibration curve is constructed from the deflections recorded.
 The patient should be weighed and the dosage calculated on the basis of 0.5 mg / kg of body weight.
 Exactly 5 mL of aqueous solvent should be added to the 25 mg vial giving 5 mg of dye per mL of solution.
 (If the photometric method is used, prior to injecting IC - GREEN™, withdraw 6 mL of venous blood from the patient's arm for serum blank and standard curve construction, and through the same needle, inject the correct amount of dye.)
 Using the ear densitometer, a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg in normal subjects gives the following clearance pattern.
 A single 20 - minute sample (withdrawn from a vein in the opposite arm to that injected) is allowed to clot, centrifuged and its optical density is determined at 805 nm using the patient's normal serum as the blank.
 A single 20 - minute sample of serum in healthy subjects should contain no more than 4% of the initial concentration of the dye.
 Figure 1
 Dosages up to 40 mg IC - GREEN™ dye in 2 mL of aqueous solvent have been found to give optimal angiograms, depending on the imaging equipment and technique used.
 The antecubital vein injected ICGREEN™ dye bolus should immediately be followed by a 5 mL bolus of normal saline.
 In clinical trials, the starting dose of Iclusig was 45 mg administered orally once daily.
 However, 59% of the patients required dose reductions to 30 mg or 15 mg once daily during the course of therapy.
 Start dosing with 45 mg once daily.
 The recommended dose should be reduced to 30 mg once daily when administering Iclusig with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 The recommended starting dose is 30 mg once daily in patients with hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh A, B, or C) [see Use in Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 IDAMYCIN (idarubicin hydrochloride for injection, USP) 12 mg / m² daily for 3 days by slow (10 to 15 min) intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine.
 The cytarabine may be given as 100 mg / m² daily by continuous infusion for 7 days or as cytarabine 25 mg / m² intravenous bolus followed by cytarabine 200 mg / m² daily for 5 days continuous infusion.
 IDAMYCIN should not be administered if the bilirubin level exceeds 5 mg%.
 IDAMYCIN 20 mg vials should be reconstituted with 20 mL of Water for Injection, USP, to give a final concentration of 1 mg / mL of idarubicin hydrochloride.
 Reconstituted solutions are physically and chemically stable for 72 hours (3 days) under refrigeration (2° to 8°C, 36° to 46°F) and at controlled room temperature, (15° to 30°C, 59° to 86°F).
 Store at controlled room temperature, 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F), and protect from light.
 IDAMYCIN PFS Injection 12 mg / m² daily for 3 days by slow (10 to 15 min) intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine.
 The cytarabine may be given as 100 mg / m² daily by continuous infusion for 7 days or as cytarabine 25 mg / m² intravenous bolus followed by cytarabine 200 mg / m² daily for 5 days continuous infusion.
 IDAMYCIN PFS should not be administered if the bilirubin level exceeds 5 mg%.
 The recommended dose is 25 to 40 IU of IDELVION per kg body weight every 7 days, or 50 to 75 IU of IDELVION per kg every 14 days.
 The calculation of the required dose of IDELVION is based on the empirical finding that one IU of IDELVION per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of FIX by an average of 1.3 IU / dL (1.3% of normal) in patients ≥ 12 years of age and by 1.0 IU / dL (1.0% of normal) in patients < 12 years of age.
 For an incremental recovery of 1 IU / dL per 1 IU / kg, the dose is calculated as follows:
 Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired FIX increase (IU / dL) x 1 dL / kg
 For an incremental recovery of 1.3 IU / dL per 1 IU / kg, the dose is calculated as follows:
 Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired FIX increase (IU / dL) x 0.77 dL / kg
 The appropriate dose would be 80 kg x 50 IU / dL x 0.77 dL / kg = 3080 IUs.
 A dose of 2000 IUs of IDELVION, administered to a 80 kg patient, should be expected to result in a peak post - injection FIX increase of 2000 IUs x 1.3 (IU / dL per IU / kg) / 80 kg = 32.5 IU / dL (32.5 % of normal).
 Table 2: Dosing for Control and Prevention of Bleeding Episodes

 The “Device box” contains one Mix2Vial® filter transfer set, one syringe, one infusion set and a plaster (non - sterile).
 CSL Behring Canada, Inc. Revised: Jan 2016
 IFEX (ifosfamide) should be administered intravenously at a dose of 1.2 g / m² per day for 5 consecutive days.
 Solutions of ifosfamide may be diluted further to achieve concentrations of 0.6 to 20 mg / mL in the following fluids:
 The recommended dose of ILARIS is 150 mg for CAPS patients with body weight greater than 40 kg.
 For CAPS patients with body weight greater than or equal to 15 kg and less than or equal to 40 kg, the recommended dose is 2 mg / kg.
 For children 15 to 40 kg with an inadequate response, the dose can be increased to 3 mg / kg.
 For patients with body weight less than or equal to 40 kg, the recommended dose is 2 mg / kg administered every 4 weeks.
 The dose can be increased to 4 mg / kg every 4 weeks if the clinical response is not adequate.
 For patients with body weight greater than 40 kg, the recommended dose is 150 mg administered every 4 weeks.
 The dose can be increased to 300 mg every 4 weeks if the clinical response is not adequate.
 The recommended dose of ILARIS for SJIA patients with a body weight greater than or equal to 7.5 kg is 4 mg / kg (with a maximum of 300 mg) administered every 4 weeks.
 STEP 1: Using aseptic technique, reconstitute each vial of ILARIS lyophilized powder by slowly injecting 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection with a 1 - mL syringe and an 18 - gauge x 2” needle.
 The reconstituted solution has a final concentration of 150 mg / mL.
 Otherwise, it should be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and used within 4 hours of reconstitution.
 STEP 1: ILARIS solution has a concentration of 150 mg / mL.
 One drop of ILEVRO (nepafenac ophthalmic suspension), 0.3% should be applied to the affected eye one - time - daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery and through the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period.
 For prophylaxis of neonatal gonococcal or chlamydial conjunctivitis, a ribbon of ointment approximately 1 cm in length should be instilled into each lower conjunctival sac.
 The recommended dose of IMBRUVICA for MCL is 560 mg (four 140 mg capsules) orally once daily.
 The recommended dose of IMBRUVICA for CLL and WM is 420 mg (three 140 mg capsules) orally once daily.
 Interrupt IMBRUVICA therapy for any Grade 3 or greater non - hematological toxicities, Grade 3 or greater neutropenia with infection or fever, or Grade 4 hematological toxicities.
 Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline (recovery), IMBRUVICA therapy may be reinitiated at the starting dose.
 If the toxicity reoccurs, reduce dose by one capsule (140 mg per day).
 A second reduction of dose by 140 mg may be considered as needed.
 If these toxicities persist or recur following two dose reductions, discontinue IMBRUVICA.
 Reduce IMBRUVICA dose to 140 mg if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used (e.g., fluconazole, darunavir, erythromycin, diltiazem, atazanavir, aprepitant, amprenavir, fosamprevir, crizotinib, imatinib, verapamil, and ciprofloxacin) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 For patients with mild liver impairment (Child - Pugh class A), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily (one capsule).
 The recommended starting dose of IMDUR Tablets is 30 mg (given as a single 30 mg tablet or as 1 / 2 of a 60 mg tablet) or 60 mg (given as a single tablet) once daily.
 After several days, the dosage may be increased to 120 mg (given as a single 120 mg tablet or as two 60 mg tablets) once daily.
 Rarely, 240 mg may be required.
 Do not break the 30 mg tablet.
 The maximum single recommended adult dose of IMITREX Injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously.
 For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, lower doses (1 mg to 5 mg) may be used [see Clinical Studies].
 The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6 - mg injections separated by at least 1 hour.
 With this device, the needle penetrates approximately 1 / 4 inch (5 to 6 mm).
 In patients receiving doses other than 4 mg or 6 mg, use the 6 - mg single - dose vial; do not use the IMITREX STATdose Pen.
 The maximum single recommended adult dose of IMITREX Injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously.
 For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, lower doses (1 mg to 5 mg) may be used [see Clinical Studies].
 The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6 - mg injections separated by at least 1 hour.
 With this device, the needle penetrates approximately 1 / 4 inch (5 to 6 mm).
 In patients receiving doses other than 4 mg or 6 mg, use the 6 - mg single - dose vial; do not use the IMITREX STAT dose Pen.
 In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg of IMITREX Nasal Spray administered into 1 nostril were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults.
 A 10 - mg dose may be achieved by the administration of a single 5 - mg dose in each nostril.
 There is evidence that doses above 20 mg do not provide a greater effect than 20 mg.
 If the headache returns, the dose may be repeated once after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 40 mg.
 IMLYGIC is provided in single - use vials of 1 mL each in two different dose strengths:
 The total injection volume for each treatment visit should not exceed 4 mL for all injected lesions combined.
 The initial recommended dose is up to 4 mL of IMLYGIC at a concentration of 106 (1 million) PFU per mL.
 The recommended dose for subsequent administrations is up to 4 mL of IMLYGIC at a concentration of 108 (100 million) PFU per mL.
 Use Table 2 to determine the volume of IMLYGIC injection for each lesion.
 When lesions are clustered together, inject them as a single lesion according to Table 2.
 Storage Times for Thawed IMLYGIC Vial at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F)
 (1 capsule = 2 mg)
 Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool.
 Daily dose should not exceed 16mg (eight capsules).
 Children: In children 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non - prescription liquid formulation (IMODIUM® (loperamide hcl) A - D 1 mg / 5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either IMODIUM® (loperamide hcl) Capsules or IMODIUM® (loperamide hcl) A - D Liquid may be used.
 Two to five years: 1 mg t.i.d.
 (3mg daily dose) (13 to 20 kg) Six to eight years: 2 mg b.i.d.
 (4mg daily dose) (20 to 30 kg) Eight to twelve years: 2mg t.i.d.
 (6mg daily dose) (greater than 30 kg)
 Following the first treatment day, it is recommended that subsequent IMODIUM® (loperamide hcl) doses (1 mg / 10 kg body weight) be administered only after a loose stool.
 Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM® (loperamide hcl) should be reduced to meet individual requirements.
 When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.
 The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules).
 A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded.
 If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration.
 The recommended dose of Imogam® Rabies - HT is 20 IU / kg (0.
 133 mL / kg) or 9 IU / lb (0.
 06 mL / lb) of body weight administered at time of the first vaccine dose.
 25, 26, 43 The gluteal area should never be used for HDCV, RVA, or PCEC injections because administration of HDCV in this area results in lower neutralizing antibody titers.
 1 Two injections would be given in the gluteal muscle if the volume is greater than 5 mL.

 The package contains a vial of freeze - dried vaccine, a syringe containing 1.0 mL of diluent, a plunger for the syringe, and a sterile needle for reconstitution.
 In the United States, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommends three injections of 1.0 mL each, one injection on Day 0, one on Day 7, and one either on Day 21 or 28.11
 A booster dose consists of one injection of 1.0 mL of Imovax Rabies vaccine.
 If their titer is inadequate, they should receive a single booster dose of vaccine.
 Dose: Previously unvaccinated persons should receive 5 intramuscular doses (1 mL each) of Imovax Rabies vaccine, one dose immediately after exposure (Day 0) and one dose 3, 7, 14, and 28 days later.
 RIG: Rabies immune globulin (RIG) 20 IU / kg on Day 0 in conjunction with the first vaccine dose.
 When an immunized person who was vaccinated using the recommended pre - exposure regimen or a prior post - exposure regimen with a cell culture vaccine or who had previously demonstrated rabies antibody is exposed to rabies, that person should receive two intramuscular doses (1.0 Ml each) of Imovax Rabies vaccine, one dose immediately after the exposure and one dose 3 days later.
 If the immune status of a previously vaccinated person who did not receive the recommended HDCV regimen is not known, full primary post - exposure antirabies treatment (RIG plus 5 doses of HDCV) may be necessary.
 In such cases, if antibody levels of greater than 1:5 dilution by a RFFIT can be demonstrated in a serum sample collected before vaccine is given, treatment can be discontinued after at least two doses of HDCV.20
 The treatment duration is 28 consecutive days.
 To reduce the risk of neural or vascular injury, the implant should be inserted at the inner side of the non - dominant upper arm about 8 - 10 cm (3 - 4 inches) above the medial epicondyle of the humerus.

 The recommended dose of INVEGA® (paliperidone) Extended - Release Tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults is 6 mg administered once daily.
 Although it has not been systematically established that doses above 6 mg have additional benefit, there was a general trend for greater effects with higher doses.
 Thus, some patients may benefit from higher doses, up to 12 mg / day, and for some patients, a lower dose of 3 mg / day may be sufficient.
 When dose increases are indicated, increments of 3 mg / day are recommended.
 The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg / day.
 The recommended starting dose of INVEGA® (paliperidone) Extended - Release Tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 12 - 17 years of age is 3 mg administered once daily.
 Dose increases, if considered necessary, should be made only after clinical reassessment and should occur at increments of 3 mg / day at intervals of more than 5 days.
 Prescribers should be mindful that, in the adolescent schizophrenia study, there was no clear enhancement to efficacy at the higher doses, i.e., 6 mg for subjects weighing less than 51 kg and 12 mg for subjects weighing 51 kg or greater, while adverse events were dose - related.
 The recommended dose of INVEGA® (paliperidone) Extended - Release Tablets for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in adults is 6 mg administered once daily.
 Some patients may benefit from lower or higher doses within the recommended dose range of 3 to 12 mg once daily.
 When dose increases are indicated, increments of 3 mg / day are recommended.
 The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg / day.
 For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL / min to < 80 mL / min), the recommended initial dose of INVEGA® is 3 mg once daily.
 The dose may then be increased to a maximum of 6 mg once daily based on clinical response and tolerability.
 For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 10 mL / min to < 50 mL / min), the recommended initial dose of INVEGA® is 1.5 mg once daily, which may be increased to a maximum of 3 mg once daily after clinical reassessment.
 For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10 mL / min to < 50 mL / min), the maximum recommended dose of INVEGA® is 3 mg once daily [see Renal Impairment above].
 Administer the dose in a single injection; do not administer the dose in divided injections.
 The recommended initiation of INVEGA SUSTENNA® is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle.
 Resume the same dose the patient was previously stabilized on (unless the patient was stabilized on a dose of 234 mg, then the first 2 injections should each be 156 mg) in the following manner:
 For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL / min to < 80 mL / min [Cockcroft - Gault Formula]), initiate INVEGA SUSTENNA® with a dose of 156 mg on treatment day 1 and 117 mg one week later.
 Thereafter, follow with monthly injections of 78 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 INVEGA SUSTENNA® is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min) [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Recommended initiation of INVEGA SUSTENNA® is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle [see Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder].
 See Table 1 above for recommended monthly maintenance dosing.
 Based on previous clinical history of tolerability and / or efficacy, some patients may benefit from lower or higher maintenance doses within the available strengths (39 mg, 78 mg, 117 mg, 156 mg, and 234 mg).
 The 39 mg strength was not studied in the long - term schizoaffective disorder study.
 The kit contains a prefilled syringe and 2 safety needles (a 1 ½ - inch 22 gauge needle and a 1 - inch 23 gauge needle) for intramuscular injection.
 h. After the injection is complete, use either thumb or finger of one hand (h1, h2) or a flat surface (h3) to activate the needle protection system.
 Administer the dose in a single injection; do not administer the dose in divided injections.
 Closely monitor and treat the patient with oral supplementation as clinically appropriate until the next scheduled 3month injection of INVEGA TRINZA® .
 In order to establish a consistent maintenance dose, it is recommended that the last two doses of INVEGA SUSTENNA® be the same dosage strength before starting INVEGA TRINZA® .
 If needed, dose adjustment can be made every 3 months in increments within the range of 273 mg to 819 mg based on individual patient tolerability and / or efficacy.
 For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL / min to < 80 mL / min [Cockcroft - Gault Formula], adjust dosage and stabilize the patient using the 1 - month paliperidone palmitate extended - release injectable suspension, then transition to INVEGA TRINZA® [see Table 1, Schizophrenia].
 INVEGA TRINZA® is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min) [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 INVEGA TRINZA® should be administered by a healthcare professional as a single injection.
 Therapy is usually started with one 2.5 mg tablet of INVERSINE (mecamylamine) twice a day.
 This initial dosage should be modified by increments of one 2.5 mg tablet at intervals of not less than 2 days until the desired blood pressure response occurs (the criterion being a dosage just under that which causes signs of mild postural hypotension).
 The average total daily dosage of INVERSINE (mecamylamine) is 25 mg, usually in three divided doses.
 However, as little as 2.5 mg daily may be sufficient to control hypertension in some patients.
 A range of two to four or even more doses may be required in severe cases when smooth control is difficult to obtain.
 Add 15 mL of either sugar syrup or sorbitol syrup (for patients with Type 1 diabetes or glucose intolerance) OR 3 teaspoons of jam to the contents of INVIRASE capsules that are in the container.
 If an inducer of UGTs (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) is co - administered with INVOKAMET, consider increasing the dose to canagliflozin 150 mg twice daily in patients currently tolerating canagliflozin 50 mg twice daily who have an eGFR of 60 mL / min / 1.73 m² or greater and require additional glycemic control [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 Consider another antihyperglycemic agent in patients with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL / min / 1.73 m² receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT inducer.
 If an inducer of UGTs (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) is co - administered with INVOKAMET XR, consider increasing the dose of canagliflozin to a total daily dose of 300 mg once daily in patients currently tolerating INVOKAMET XR with 100 mg canagliflozin once daily who have an eGFR of 60 mL / min / 1.73 m² or greater and require additional glycemic control [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].

 The dosage recommended for use in children for excretory urography is 1.2 mL / kg to 3.6 mL / kg for ISOVUE - 250 and 1.0 mL / kg to 3.0 mL / kg for ISOVUE - 300.
 It should not be necessary to exceed a total dose of 30 grams of iodine.
 CECT OF THE HEAD: The suggested dose for ISOVUE - 250 is 130 to 240 mL and for ISOVUE300 is 100 to 200 mL by intravenous administration.
 CECT OF THE BODY: The usual adult dose range for ISOVUE - 250 is 130 to 240 mL and for ISOVUE - 300 is 100 to 200 mL administered by rapid intravenous infusion or bolus injection.
 The total dose for either CECT procedure should not exceed 60 grams of iodine.
 The dosage recommended for use in children for contrast enhanced computed tomography is 1.2 mL / kg to 3.6 mL / kg for ISOVUE - 250 and 1.0 mL / kg to 3.0 mL / kg for ISOVUE - 300.
 It should not be necessary to exceed a total dose of 30 grams of iodine.
 One drop of Istalol® (timolol maleate ophthalmic solution) 0.5% should be administered in the affected eye(s) once a day in the AM.
 The recommended dose of romidepsin is 14 mg / m2 administered intravenously over a 4 - hour period on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 - day cycle.
 ISTODAX and diluent vials contain an overfill to ensure the recommended volume can be withdrawn at a concentration of 5 mg / mL.
 There are no well - controlled studies in children to establish appropriate dosing; however, the American Heart Association recommends an initial infusion rate of 0.1 mcg / kg / min, with the usual range being 0.1 mcg / kg / min to 1 mcg / kg / min.
 The recommended dosage of IXEMPRA is 40 mg / m² administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks.
 Doses for patients with body surface area (BSA) greater than 2.2 m² should be calculated based on 2.2 m².
 Patients should not begin a new cycle of treatment unless the neutrophil count is at least 1500 cells / mm³, the platelet count is at least 100,000 cells / mm³, and nonhematologic toxicities have improved to grade 1 (mild) or resolved.
 Combination Therapy: IXEMPRA in combination with capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with AST or ALT > 2.5 x ULN or bilirubin > 1 x ULN.
 Patients receiving combination treatment who have AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN and bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN may receive the standard dose of ixabepilone (40 mg / m²) [see BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and Use In Specific Populations].
 Patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at 20 mg / m², the dosage in subsequent cycles may be escalated up to, but not exceeding, 30 mg / m² if tolerated.
 Limited data are available for patients with baseline AST or ALT > 5 x ULN.
 Based on pharmacokinetic studies, if a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor must be coadministered, a dose reduction to 20 mg / m² is predicted to adjust the ixabepilone AUC to the range observed without inhibitors and should be considered.
 Once patients have been maintained on a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the dose of IXEMPRA may be gradually increased from 40 mg / m² to 60 mg / m² depending on tolerance.
 Patients whose dose is increased above 40 mg / m² should be monitored carefully for toxicities associated with IXEMPRA.
 Patients who experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to IXEMPRA require premedication with corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously, 30 minutes before infusion or orally, 60 minutes before infusion) in addition to pretreatment with H1 and H2 antagonists.
 IXEMPRA Kit contains two vials, a vial labeled IXEMPRA (ixabepilone) for injection which contains ixabepilone powder and a vial containing DILUENT for IXEMPRA.
 IXEMPRA Kit must be stored in a refrigerator at 2° C - 8° C (36° F - 46° F) in the original package to protect from light.
 To allow for withdrawal losses, the vial labeled as 15 mg IXEMPRA for injection contains 16 mg of ixabepilone and the vial labeled as 45 mg IXEMPRA for injection contains 47 mg of ixabepilone.
 The 15 - mg IXEMPRA Kit is supplied with a vial providing 8 mL of the DILUENT and the 45 - mg IXEMPRA Kit is supplied with a vial providing 23.5 mL of the DILUENT.
 After constituting with the DILUENT, the concentration of ixabepilone is 2 mg / mL.
 Before administration, the constituted solution must be further diluted with one of the specified infusion fluids listed below.
 For most doses, a 250 mL bag of infusion fluid is sufficient.
 The final concentration for infusion must be between 0.2 mg / mL and 0.6 mg / mL.
 The infusion solution must be administered through an appropriate in - line filter with a microporous membrane of 0.2 to 1.2 microns.
 Children 2 months to < 3 years of age: Primary immunization with IXIARO consists of two (2) 0.25 mL doses, administered 28 days apart.
 Individuals 3 years of age and older: Primary immunization with IXIARO consists of two (2) 0.5 mL doses, administered 28 days apart.
 Individuals 17 years of age and older: If the primary series of two doses was completed more than 1 year previously, a booster dose may be given if ongoing exposure or re - exposure to JEV is expected.
 Figure 1: Preparation for Administration of 0.25 mL Dose
 Calculate the initial dose of IXINITY based on the empirical finding that one international unit (IU) of IXINITY per kg body weight increases the circulating level of factor IX by 0.98 international units / dL (IU / dL) of plasma in adults and children ≥ 12 years of age.
 For an incremental recovery of 0.98 IU / dL per IU / kg, calculate the dose as follows:
 Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (% of normal or IU / dL) x 1.02 dL / kg
 Table 1 : Dosing for Control and Prevention of Bleeding Episodes
 Table 2 : Dosing for Perioperative Management
 If only dosing with a single vial, proceed to administer IXINITY via intravenous infusion; otherwise proceed to Pooling Instructions.
 The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
 If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.
 Jadelle® (levonorgestrel implants (unavailable in us)) implants are a set of two flexible cylindrical implants, each containing 75 mg of the progestin levonorgestrel.
 The total administered (implanted) dose is 150 mg. Insertion of the two implants should be performed during the first 7 days following the onset of menses by a health - care professional familiar with the levonorgestrel implant insertion technique.
 The evidence should include the transfusion of at least 100 mL / kg of packed red blood cells (e.g., at least 20 units of packed red blood cells for a 40 kg person or more in individuals weighing more than 40 kg), and a serum ferritin consistently greater than 1000 mcg / L.
 The recommended initial dose of JADENU for patients 2 years of age and older is 14 mg per kg body weight orally, once daily.
 Make dose adjustments in steps of 3.5 or 7 mg per kg and tailor adjustments to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals.
 In patients not adequately controlled with doses of 21 mg per kg (e.g., serum ferritin levels persistently above 2500 mcg / L and not showing a decreasing trend over time), doses of up to 28 mg per kg may be considered.
 Doses above 28 mg per kg are not recommended.
 If the serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 mcg / L, consider temporarily interrupting therapy with JADENU [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 JADENU therapy should only be considered when a patient with NTDT syndrome has an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe / g dw and a serum ferritin greater than 300 mcg / L.
 Restart treatment when the LIC rises again to more than 5 mg Fe / g dw.
 JADENU tablets may be taken on an empty stomach or with a light meal (contains less than 7% fat content and approximately 250 calories).
 Examples of light meals include 1 whole wheat English muffin, 1 packet jelly (0.5 ounces), and skim milk (8 fluid ounces) or a turkey sandwich (2 oz.
 turkey on whole wheat bread w / lettuce, tomato, and 1 packet mustard).
 Commercial crushers with serrated surfaces should be avoided for crushing a single 90 mg tablet.
 For patients with renal impairment (ClCr 40 to 60 mL / min), reduce the starting dose by 50% [see Use In Specific Populations].
 Do not use JADENU in patients with serum creatinine greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ClCr less than 40 mL / min [see CONTRAINDICATIONS].
 Pediatric Patients (ages 2 to 15 years):
 Pediatric Patients (ages 10 to 15 years):
 Following treatment interruption for ANC below 0.5 X 109 / L, after ANC recovers to 0.75 X 109 / L or greater, restart dosing at the higher of 5 mg once daily or 5 mg twice daily below the largest dose in the week prior to the treatment interruption.
 If the response is insufficient and platelet and neutrophil counts are adequate, doses may be increased in 5 mg twice daily increments to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily.
 Based on limited clinical data, long - term maintenance at a 5 mg twice daily dose has not shown responses and continued use at this dose should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks.
 Restart dosing at the higher of 5 mg once daily or 5 mg twice daily below the largest dose in the week prior to the decrease in platelet count below 25 X 109 / L or ANC below 0.5 X 109 / L that led to dose interruption.
 If the response is insufficient as defined in Section 2.1.2, doses may be increased by increments of 5 mg daily to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily if:
 The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg twice daily.
 Patients who had required dose interruption while receiving a dose of 5 mg twice daily, may restart at a dose of 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg once daily, but not higher, once hemoglobin is greater than or equal to 10 g / dL, platelet count is greater than or equal to 75 X 109 / L, and ANC is greater than or equal to 1.5 X 109 / L.
 After restarting Jakafi following treatment interruption, doses may be titrated, but the maximum total daily dose should not exceed 5 mg less than the dose that resulted in the dose interruption.
 If the response is insufficient and platelet, hemoglobin, and neutrophil counts are adequate, doses may be increased in 5 mg twice daily increments to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily.
 Modify the dose of Jakafi when given concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as but not limited to boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir / ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) and fluconazole doses of less than or equal to 200 mg as follows [see DRUG INTERACTIONS], according to Table 7.
 Avoid the use of fluconazole doses of greater than 200 mg daily concomitantly with Jakafi.
 The recommended starting dose for patients with myelofibrosis with end stage renal disease on dialysis is 15 mg once after a dialysis session for patients with a platelet count between 100 X 109 / L and 200 X 109 / L or 20 mg for patients with a platelet count of greater than 200 X 109 / L.
 The recommended starting dose for patients with polycythemia vera with end stage renal disease on dialysis is 10 mg. Additional dose modifications should be made with frequent monitoring of safety and efficacy.
 Table 9: Dosing for Hepatic Impairment
 When discontinuing Jakafi therapy for reasons other than thrombocytopenia, gradual tapering of the dose of Jakafi may be considered, for example by 5 mg twice daily each week.
 The tube should be rinsed with approximately 75 mL of water.
 	The recommended dosage of JALYN is 1 capsule (0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) taken once daily approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day.
 For patients with two or more episodes of documented DVT or PE, indefinite treatment with warfarin is suggested.
 For patients with a first episode of DVT or PE who have documented antiphospholipid antibodies or who have two or more thrombophilic conditions, treatment for 12 months is recommended and indefinite therapy is suggested.
 For patients with a first episode of DVT or PE who have documented deficiency of antithrombin, deficiency of Protein C or Protein S, or the Factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210 gene mutation, homocystinemia, or high Factor VIII levels ( > 90th percentile of normal), treatment for 6 to 12 months is recommended and indefinite therapy is suggested for idiopathic thrombosis.
 The risk - benefit should be reassessed periodically in patients who receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment.5,13 The dose of warfarin should be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations.
 Meta - analysis findings of these studies revealed that the effects of warfarin in reducing thromboembolic events including stroke were similar at either moderately high INR (2.0 - 4.5) or low INR (1.4 - 3.0).
 The trials in non - valvular atrial fibrillation support the American College of Chest Physicians' (7th ACCP) recommendation that an INR of 2.0 - 3.0 be used for warfarin therapy in appropriate AF patients.10
 In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, but who are at intermediate risk of stroke, antithrombotic therapy with either oral warfarin or aspirin, 325 mg / day, is recommended.
 For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, anticoagulation with oral warfarin is recommended (7th ACCP).
 In healthcare settings in which meticulous INR monitoring is standard and routinely accessible, for both high - and low - risk patients after myocardial infarction (MI), long - term (up to 4 years) high - intensity oral warfarin (target INR, 3.5; range, 3.0 to 4.0) without concomitant aspirin or moderate - intensity oral warfarin (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) with aspirin is recommended.
 For high - risk patients with MI, including those with a large anterior MI, those with significant heart failure, those with intracardiac thrombus visible on echocardiography, and those with a history of a thromboembolic event, therapy with combined moderate - intensity (INR, 2.0 to 3.0) oral warfarin plus low - dose aspirin ( ≤ 100 mg / day) for 3 months after the MI is suggested.16
 For patients with a St. Jude Medical (St. Paul, MN) bileaflet valve in the aortic position, a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended.
 For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, the 7th ACCP recommends a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5).
 For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) in combination with aspirin, 75 to 100 mg / day is recommended.
 For patients with bioprosthetic valves, warfarin therapy with a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended for valves in the mitral position and is suggested for valves in the aortic position for the first 3 months after valve insertion.8
 It is recommended that Jantoven® Tablets (warfarin sodium tablets) therapy be initiated with a dose of 2 to 5 mg per day with dosage adjustments based on the results of PT / INR determinations.10,11
 Most patients are satisfactorily maintained at a dose of 2 to 10 mg daily.
 To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full dose heparin therapy and that Jantoven® Tablets (warfarin sodium tablets) therapy be overlapped with heparin for 4 to 5 days, until Jantoven® Tablets (warfarin sodium tablets) has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by PT / INR.
 The dosage of JANUMET should be individualized on the basis of the patient's current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg sitagliptin and 2000 mg metformin.
 50 mg sitagliptin / 500 mg metformin hydrochloride 50 mg sitagliptin / 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride.
 The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin / 500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin.
 The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken.
 For patients taking metformin 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET is 50 mg sitagliptin / 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily.
 The dose of JANUMET XR should be individualized on the basis of the patient's current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg sitagliptin and 2000 mg metformin.
 The 100 mg sitagliptin / 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablet should be taken as a single tablet once daily.
 Patients using two JANUMET XR tablets (such as two 50 mg sitagliptin / 500 mg metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets or two 50 mg sitagliptin / 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets) should take the two tablets together once daily.
 In patients taking JANUMET XR whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL / min / 1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy and limit dose of the sitagliptin component to 50 mg once daily.
 The recommended dose of JANUVIA is 100 mg once daily.
 For patients with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CrCl] greater than or equal to 50 mL / min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of less than or equal to 1.7 mg / dL in men and less than or equal to 1.5 mg / dL in women), no dosage adjustment for JANUVIA is required.
 For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl greater than or equal to 30 to less than 50 mL / min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of greater than 1.7 to less than or equal to 3.0 mg / dL in men and greater than 1.5 to less than or equal to 2.5 mg / dL in women), the dose of JANUVIA is 50 mg once daily.
 For patients with severe renal insufficiency (CrCl less than 30 mL / min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of greater than 3.0 mg / dL in men and greater than 2.5 mg / dL in women) or with end - stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose of JANUVIA is 25 mg once daily.
 The recommended dose of JARDIANCE is 10 mg once daily in the morning, taken with or without food.
 In patients tolerating JARDIANCE, the dose may be increased to 25 mg [see Clinical Studies].
 For persons 3 years of age and older, a single dose is 1.0 mL of vaccine.
 For children 1 year to 3 years of age, a single dose is 0.5 mL of vaccine.
 Reconstitute only with the supplied 1.3 mL of diluent (Sterile Water for Injection).
 After reconstitution the vaccine should be stored at 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F) and used within 8 hours.
 The recommended primary immunization series is three doses of 1.0 mL each for individuals > 3 years of age given subcutaneously on days 0, 7, and 30.
 For children 1 to 3 years of age a series of three doses of 0.5 mL each should be given subcutaneously on days 0, 7, and 30.
 (When it is impossible to follow one of the above recommended schedules, two doses given a week apart will induce antibodies in approximately 80% of vaccinees; however, this two - dose regimen should not be used except under unusual circumstances.)
 A booster dose of 1.0 mL (0.5 mL for children from 1 to 3 years of age) may be given after two years.
 Whenever possible, immunization of infants should be deferred until they are one year of age or older.1
 Initiate treatment with one 0.1 mg tablet at bedtime.
 Increase the dose in increments of 0.1 mg per day at weekly intervals, if necessary, until the desired response is achieved.
 Total daily doses above 0.1 mg per day should be divided and taken at morning and bedtime.
 For example, a daily dose of 0.2 mg should be taken as 0.1 mg in the morning and 0.1 mg at bedtime or a daily dose of 0.4 mg taken as 0.2 mg in the morning and 0.2 mg at bedtime.
 Jenloga (clonidine tablets) was studied at doses of 0.2 to 0.6 mg per day, with little or no therapeutic benefit seen for the 0.6 mg dose over the 0.4 mg dose [see Clinical Studies].
 Doses of Jenloga (clonidine tablets) higher than 0.6 mg per day (0.3 mg twice daily) were not evaluated in clinical trials and are not recommended.
 Start at 0.1 mg per day and uptitrate slowly.
 The dosage of JENTADUETO should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg linagliptin / 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily.
 The dosage of JENTADUETO XR should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended total daily dose of linagliptin 5 mg and metformin hydrochloride 2000 mg. JENTADUETO XR should be given once daily with a meal.
 JENTADUETO XR 5 mg linagliptin / 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablet should be taken as a single tablet once daily.
 Patients using 2.5 mg linagliptin / 1000 mg metformin extended - release tablets should take two tablets together once daily.
 The recommended dose is 0.125 mg (0.1 mL of the diluted solution) administered by intravitreal injection to the affected eye once as a single dose.
 Remove the vial (2.5 mg / mL corresponding to 0.5 mg ocriplasmin) from the freezer and allow to thaw at room temperature (within a few minutes).
 Figure 1
 Figure 2
 Using aseptic technique, add 0.2 mL of 0.9% w / v Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (sterile, preservative - free) into the JETREA vial (see Figure 3) and gently swirl the vial until the solutions are mixed (see Figure 4).
 Figure 5
 Replace the needle with a sterile #30 gauge needle, carefully expel the air bubbles and excess drug from the syringe and adjust the dose to the 0.1 mL mark on the syringe (corresponding to 0.125 mg ocriplasmin) (see Figure 6).
 The injection volume of 0.1 mL is then delivered into the mid - vitreous.
 Each vial should only be used to provide a single injection for the treatment of a single eye.
 The individual dosage of JEVTANA is based on calculation of the Body Surface Area (BSA) and is 25 mg / m2 administered as a one - hour intravenous infusion every three weeks in combination with oral prednisone 10 mg administered daily throughout JEVTANA treatment.
 JEVTANA injection single - use vial requires two dilutions prior to administration [see Preparation And Administration].
 JEVTANA requires two dilutions prior to administration.
 This overfill ensures that after dilution with the entire contents of the accompanying diluent, there is an initial diluted solution containing 10 mg / mL JEVTANA.
 Once reconstituted, the resultant solution contains 10 mg / mL of JEVTANA.
 The resulting initial diluted JEVTANA solution (cabazitaxel 10 mg / mL) requires further dilution before administration.
 Withdraw the recommended dose from the JEVTANA solution containing 10 mg / mL as prepared in Step 1 using a calibrated syringe and further dilute into a sterile 250 mL PVC - free container of either 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% dextrose solution for infusion.
 If a dose greater than 65 mg of JEVTANA is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of 0.26 mg / mL JEVTANA is not exceeded.
 The concentration of the JEVTANA final infusion solution should be between 0.10 mg / mL and 0.26 mg / mL.
 Use an in - line filter of 0.22 micrometer nominal pore size (also referred to as 0.2 micrometer) during administration.
 Jinteli therapy consists of a single tablet taken once daily.
 Junel® 21 provides the patient with a convenient tablet schedule of “3 weeks on - - 1 week off”.
 Two dosage regimens are described, one of which may be more convenient or suitable than the other for an individual patient.
 With either regimen, the patient takes one tablet daily for 21 consecutive days followed by one week of no tablets.
 Menstruation usually begins two or three days, but may begin as late as the fourth or fifth day, after discontinuing medication.
 If spotting occurs while on the usual regimen of one tablet daily, the patient should continue medication without interruption.
 If a patient forgets to take one or more tablets, the following is suggested:
 One tablet is missed
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (week 1 or week 2)
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (week 3)
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one tablet is missed, the possibility of spotting or bleeding is increased.
 This is particularly likely to occur if two or more consecutive tablets are missed.
 Menstruation usually begins two or three days, but may begin as late as the fourth or fifth day, after the brown tablets have been started.
 If a patient forgets to take one or more light yellow or pink tablets, the following is suggested:
 One tablet is missed
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (week 1 or week 2)
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (week 3)
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one light yellow or pink tablet is missed, the possibility of spotting or bleeding is increased.
 This is particularly likely to occur if two or more consecutive light yellow or pink tablets are missed.
 If the patient forgets to take any of the seven brown tablets in week four, those brown tablets that were missed are discarded and one brown tablet is taken each day until the pack is empty.
 A new pack of tablets should be started no later than the eighth day after the last light yellow or pink tablet was taken.
 The dosages for therapy with JUVISYNC are 100 mg / 10 mg, 100 mg / 20 mg, 100 mg / 40 mg, 50 mg / 10 mg, 50 mg / 20 mg, and 50 mg / 40 mg (sitagliptin / simvastatin) once daily.
 JUVISYNC should be taken as a single daily dose in the evening.
 The recommended starting dose is 100 mg / 40 mg per day.
 For patients already taking simvastatin (10, 20, or 40 mg daily) with or without sitagliptin 100 mg daily, JUVISYNC may be initiated at the dose of 100 mg sitagliptin and the dose of simvastatin already being taken.
 JUVISYNC can be used in patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] greater than or equal to 50 mL / min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of less than or equal to 1.7 mg / dL in men and less than or equal to 1.5 mg / dL in women), without adjustment of the sitagliptin dose.
 For patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl greater than or equal to 30 to less than 50 mL / min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of greater than 1.7 to less than or equal to 3.0 mg / dL in men and greater than 1.5 to less than or equal to 2.5 mg / dL in women), the recommended starting dose of JUVISYNC is 50 mg / 40 mg once daily.
 For patients with moderate renal impairment who are already taking simvastatin (10, 20, or 40 mg daily) with or without sitagliptin 50 mg daily, JUVISYNC may be initiated at the dose of 50 mg sitagliptin and the dose of simvastatin already being taken.
 The recommended dosage is 100 mg / 40 mg (for patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function) or 50 mg / 40 mg (for patients with moderately impaired renal function) per day in the evening.
 For patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function, JUVISYNC dosage should not exceed 100 mg / 20 mg daily (or 100 mg / 40 mg daily for patients who have previously taken simvastatin 80 mg daily chronically, e.g., for 12 months or more, without evidence of muscle toxicity) while taking lomitapide.
 For patients with moderately impaired renal function, JUVISYNC dosage should not exceed 50 mg / 20 mg daily (or 50 mg / 40 mg daily for patients who have previously taken simvastatin 80 mg daily chronically, e.g., for 12 months or more, without evidence of muscle toxicity) while taking lomitapide.
 Because of an increased risk for myopathy in Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 g / day niacin) of niacin - containing products, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with JUVISYNC 100 mg / 40 mg or 50 mg / 40 mg per day coadministered with lipid - modifying doses of niacin - containing products.
 The recommended starting dosage of JUXTAP ID is 5 mg once daily, and the dose should be escalated gradually based on acceptable safety and tolerability.
 The maintenance dosage of JUXTAP ID should be individualized, taking into account patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response to treatment, to a maximum of 60 mg daily as described in Table 1.
 To reduce the risk of developing a fat - soluble nutrient deficiency due to JUXTAPID's mechanism of action in the small intestine, patients treated with JUXTAP ID should take daily supplements that contain 400 international units vitamin E and at least 200 mg linoleic acid, 210 mg alpha - linolenic acid (ALA), 110 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 80 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended maximum dosage of JUXTAPID is 30 mg daily with concomitant use of weak CYP3A4 inhibit ors (such as alprazolam, amiodarone, amlodipine, atorvastatin, bicalutamide, cilostazol, cimetidine, cyclosporine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ginkgo, goldenseal, isoniazid, lapatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, ranitidine, ranolazine, ticagrelor, zileuton).
 However, the recommended maximum dosage of JUXTAPID is 40 mg daily with concomitant use of oral contraceptives.
 When initiatin g a weak CYP3A4 inhibit or in a patient already taking JUXTAPID 10 mg daily or more, decrease the dose of JUXTAPID by half; patients taking JUXTAPID 5 mg daily may continue with the same dosage.
 Careful titration of JUXTAPID may then be considered according to LDL - C response and safety / tolerabilit y to a maximum recommended dosage of 30 mg daily except when coadministered with oral contraceptives, in which case the maximum recommended lomitapide dosage is 40 mg daily [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 Table 2 summarizes recommendations for dose adjustment and monitoring for patients who develop elevated transaminases during therapy with JUXTAPID [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Patients with end - stage renal disease receiving dialysis should not exceed 40 mg daily.
 Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh A) should not exceed 40 mg daily [see Use in Specific Populations].
 The usual dietary potassium intake by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day.
 Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
 Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.
 K - LOR (potassium chloride) 20 mEq powder provides 20 mEq of potassium chloride.
 Each 20 mEq (one K - LOR (potassium chloride) 20 mEq packet) of potassium should be dissolved in at least 4 oz (approximately 1 / 2 glassful) cold water or juice.
 Adults: One or two tablets four times daily; Pediatric Patients over 4 years of age: One tablet four times daily.
 The usual dietary potassium intake by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day.
 Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
 Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.
 K - TAB tablets provide 10 mEq of potassium chloride.
 Use infusion sets (according to ISO Number 8536 - 4) with an external spike diameter of 5.5 to 5.7 mm.
 The recommended dosage of KABIVEN® in adults is 19 to 38 mL / kg / day.
 The maximum daily dosage of KABIVEN® in adults should not exceed 40 mL / kg / day.
 In patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg / dL, stop the KABIVEN® infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels.
 Once the triglycerides are < 400 mg / dL, restart KABIVEN® at a lower infusion rate and advance rate in smaller increments towards target dosage, checking the triglyceride levels prior to each adjustment [see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Renal patients not needing dialysis require 0.6 to 0.8 g of protein / kg / day.
 Patients on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1.2 to 1.8 g of protein / kg / day up to a maximum of 2.5 g of protein / kg / day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses2.
 The maximum infusion rate of KABIVEN® is 2.6 mL / kg / hour.
 This corresponds to 0.09 g / kg / hour of amino acids, 0.25 g / kg / hour of dextrose (the rate limiting factor) and 0.1 g / kg / hour of lipids.
 The recommended dose of KADCYLA is 3.6 mg / kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21 - day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 Do not administer KADCYLA at doses greater than 3.6 mg / kg.
 Permanently discontinue KADCYLA treatment in patients with serum transaminases > 3 x ULN and concomitant total bilirubin > 2 x ULN.
 KADIAN 100 mg, 130 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg capsules are only for patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established.
 Patients considered opioid - tolerant are those taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of morphine daily, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

 Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio: Between 2 mg and 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine.
 Typically, a dose of oral morphine that is three times the daily parenteral morphine requirement is sufficient.
 The recommended dose of KALBITOR is 30 mg (3 mL), administered subcutaneously in three 10 mg (1 mL) injections.
 If the attack persists, an additional dose of 30 mg may be administered within a 24 hour period.
 Using aseptic technique, withdraw 1 mL (10 mg) of KALBITOR from the vial using a large bore needle.
 The recommended needle size is 27 gauge.
 Injection sites should be separated by at least 2 inches (5 cm) and away from the anatomical site of attack.
 For children less than 12 years of age who weigh greater than 40 kg or for children greater than 12 years of age, the maximum dose of 400 / 100 mg twice daily (given as three 133 / 33 mg capsules twice daily taken with food) is recommended.
 For children weighing more than 45 kg, the recommended dose of KALETRA capsules is 533 / 133 mg twice daily (given as four 133 / 33 mg capsules twice daily taken with food) when used in combination with efavirenz, nevirapine, or nelfinavir.
 Before prescribing KALETRA 100 / 25 mg tablets, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow intact tablets.
 If a child is unable to reliably swallow a KALETRA tablet, the KALETRA oral solution formulation should be prescribed.
 KALETRA oral solution contains 42.4% (v / v) alcohol and 15.3% (w / v) propylene glycol.
 *BSA (m²) = √Ht (Cm) Wt (kg) / 3600
 If KALETRA oral solution is used, the volume (mL) of KALETRA solution can be determined as follows: Volume of KALETRA solution (mL) = Administered lopinavir dose (mg) ÷ 80 (mg / mL)
 In pediatric patients 14 days to 6 months of age, the recommended dosage of lopinavir / ritonavir using KALETRA oral solution is 16 / 4 mg / kg or 300 / 75 mg / m² twice daily.
 Table 4: Recommended KALETRA Oral Daily Dosage in Pediatric Patients 14 days to 6 months
 In children 6 months to 18 years of age, the recommended dosage of lopinavir / ritonavir using KALETRA oral solution without concomitant efavirenz, nevirapine, or nelfinavir is 230 / 57.5 mg / m² given twice daily, not to exceed the recommended adult dose (400 / 100 mg [5 mL] twice daily).
 If weight - based dosing is preferred, the recommended dosage of lopinavir / ritonavir for patients < 15 kg is 12 / 3 mg / kg given twice daily and the dosage for patients ≥ 15 kg to 40 kg is 10 / 2.5 mg / kg given twice daily.
 Table 5 summarizes the recommended daily dosing regimen for pediatric patients 6 months to 18 years.
 A dose increase of KALETRA to 300 / 75 mg / m² using KALETRA oral solution is needed when co - administered with efavirenz, nevirapine, or nelfinavir in children (both treatment - naïve and treatment - experienced) 6 months to 18 years of age, not to exceed the recommended adult dose (533 / 133 mg [6.5 mL] twice daily).
 If weight - based dosing is preferred, the recommended dosage for patients < 15 kg is 13 / 3.25 mg / kg given twice daily and the dosage for patients > 15 kg to 45 kg is 11 / 2.75 mg / kg given twice daily.
 Administer 400 / 100 mg of KALETRA twice daily in pregnant patients with no documented lopinavir - associated resistance substitutions.
 The recommended dose of KALYDECO for both adults and pediatric patients age 6 years and older is one 150 mg tablet taken orally every 12 hours (300 mg total daily dose) with fat - containing food.
 The dose of KALYDECO should be reduced to 150 mg once daily for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class B).
 KALYDECO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class C) at a dose of 150 mg once daily or less frequently [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and PATIENT INFORMATION].
 When KALYDECO is being co - administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), the dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice a week.
 The dose of KALYDECO should be reduced to 150 mg once daily when co - administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole).
 It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations intermittently during therapy since both concentrations are used to determine the adequacy and safety of the dose and to adjust the dosage during treatment.
 Peak serum concentrations (30 to 90 minutes after injection) above 35 µg per mL and trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose) above 10 µg per mL should be avoided.
 The recommended dose for adults or children is 15 mg / kg / day in two equally divided dosages administered at equally divided intervals; ie, 7.5 mg / kg q 12h.
 If continuously high blood levels are desired, the daily dose of 15 mg / kg may be given in equally divided doses every 6 or 8 hours.
 Treatment of patients in the heavier weight classes, ie, 100 kg, should not exceed 1.5 g / day.
 In patients with impaired renal function, it is desirable to follow therapy by appropriate serum assays.
 Serum creatinine (mg / 100 mL) x 9 = Dosage Interval (in hours); eg, if the serum creatinine is 2 mg, the recommended dose (7.5 mg / kg) should be administered every 18 hours.
 The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days.
 Total daily dose by all routes of administration should not exceed 1.5 g / day.
 The dose should not exceed 15 mg / kg per day and must be administered slowly.
 The solution for intravenous use is prepared by adding the contents of a 500 - mg vial to 100 to 200 mL of sterile diluent such as Normal Saline or 5% Dextrose in Water, or the contents of a 1.0 - g vial to 200 to 400 mL of sterile diluent.
 The total daily dose should be divided into 2 or 3 equally divided doses.
 Adults: 500 mg diluted in 20 mL sterile distilled water may be instilled through a polyethylene catheter sutured into the wound at closure.
 250 mg 2 to 4 times a day.
 Withdraw 250 mg (1.0 mL) from a 500 - mg vial and dilute it with 3 mL Physiological Saline and nebulize.
 KANTREX (kanamycin) Injection in concentrations of 0.25 percent (2.5 mg / mL) has been used as an irrigating solution in abscess cavities, pleural space, peritoneal and ventricular cavities.
 Possible absorption of KANTREX (kanamycin) by such routes must be taken into account and dosage adjustments should be arranged so that a maximum total dose of 1.5 g / day by all routes of administration is not exceeded.
 The recommended starting dosage is 1 mg / kg administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion.
 For patients who do not achieve an optimal clinical response, increase to 3 mg / kg once weekly.
 The recommended dosage is 1 mg / kg administered once every other week as an intravenous infusion.
 Table 1: Total Infusion Volumes*
 Consider further prolonging the infusion time for patients receiving the 3 mg / kg dose or those who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 If immediate use is not possible, the diluted product may be stored up to 24 hours in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).
 KAPIDEX (dexlansoprazole delayed release capsules) is available as capsules in 30 mg and 60 mg strengths for adult use.
 Table 1: KAPIDEX (dexlansoprazole delayed release capsules) Dosing Recommendations
 Consider a maximum daily dose of 30 mg for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class B).
 KAPVAY is an extended - release tablet to be taken orally with or without food.
 Dosing should be initiated with one 0.1 mg tablet at bedtime, and the daily dosage should be adjusted in increments of 0.1 mg / day at weekly intervals until the desired response is achieved.
 Doses of KAPVAY higher than 0.4 mg / day (0.2 mg twice daily) were not evaluated in clinical trials for ADHD and are not recommended.
 When discontinuing KAPVAY, the total daily dose should be tapered in decrements of no more than 0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days to avoid rebound hypertension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Adults and Adolescents 12 years of age and older: 7.5 mL to 20 mL (6 to 16 mg) every 12 hours Children 2 to 11 years of age (approximately 0.2 to 0.4 mg / kg / day):
 2 to 3 years: 3.75 mL to 5 mL (3 to 4 mg) every 12 hours
 4 to 5 years: 3.75 mL to 10 mL (3 to 8 mg) very 12 hours
 6 to 11 years: 7.5 mL to 15 mL (6 to 12 mg) every 12 hours
 One white tablet is taken daily for 21 days, followed by 1 light - green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days and 1 light - blue (active) tablet daily for 5 days.
 If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should keep taking 1 white tablet daily until the next Sunday.
 Counting the first day of menstruation as “Day 1”, tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one light - green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 light - blue (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days.
 If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day.
 The average daily adult dose of the resin is 15 g to 60 g. This is best provided by administering 15 g (approximately 4 level teaspoons) of KAYEXALATE one to four times daily.
 One gram of KAYEXALATE contains 4.1 mEq of sodium; one level teaspoon contains approximately 3.5 g of KAYEXALATE and 15 mEq of sodium.
 (A heaping teaspoon may contain as much as 10 g to 12 g of KAYEXALATE.)
 Since the in vivo efficiency of sodium - potassium exchange resins is approximately 33 percent, about one third of the resin's actual sodium content is being delivered to the body.
 In smaller children and infants, lower doses should be employed by using as a guide a rate of 1 mEq of potassium per gram of resin as the basis for calculation.
 The amount of fluid usually ranges from 20 mL to 100 mL, depending on the dose, or may be simply determined by allowing 3 mL to 4 mL per gram of resin.
 The resin may also be given, although with less effective results, in an enema consisting (for adults) of 30 g to 50 g every six hours.
 Each dose is administered as a warm emulsion (at body temperature) in 100 mL of aqueous vehicle.
 The suspension is flushed with 50 mL or 100 mL of fluid, following which the tube is clamped and left in place.
 Two quarts of flushing solution may be necessary.
 12.5 mg alogliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl
 12.5 mg alogliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl
 Reconstitute Kcentra with 20 mL of diluent (Sterile Water for Injection, USP) provided with the kit.
 For example, an 80 kg patient with a baseline of INR of 5.0, the dose would be 2,800 Factor IX units of Kcentra, calculated as follows based on INR range of 4 - 6, see Table 1:
 35 units of Factor IX / kg x 80 kg = 2,800 units of Factor IX required*
 * For a vial with an actual potency of 30 units / mL Factor IX, 93 mL would be given (2,800 U / 30 U per mL = 93 mL)

 If the same patient is to receive more than one vial, you may pool the contents of multiple vials.
 If the serum potassium level is greater than 2.5 mEq / liter, potassium chloride should be given at a rate not to exceed 10 mEq / hour in a concentration less than 30 mEq / liter.
 The total 24 - hour dose should not exceed 200 mEq.
 If urgent treatment is indicated (serum potassium level less than 2.0 mEq / liter with electrocardiographic changes or paralysis), potassium chloride may be infused at a rate of 40 mEq / hour.
 The usual dose of oral KEFLEX is 250 mg every 6 hours, but a dose of 500 mg every 12 hours may be administered.
 For more severe infections larger doses of oral KEFLEX may be needed, up to 4 grams daily in two to four equally divided doses.
 The recommended total daily dose of oral KEFLEX for pediatric patients is 25 to 50 mg / kg given in equally divided doses for 7 to 14 days.
 In severe infections, a total daily dose of 50 to 100 mg / kg may be administered in equally divided doses.
 For the treatment of otitis media, the recommended daily dose is 75 to 100 mg / kg given in equally divided doses.
 The usual dose of procyclidine hydrochloride for initial treatment is 2.5 mg administered three times daily after meals.
 If well tolerated, this dose may be gradually increased to 5 mg three times a day and occasionally 5 mg given before retiring.
 This is accomplished gradually by substituting 2.5 mg three times a day for all or part of the original drug.
 A convenient method to establish the daily dosage of procyclidine is to begin with the administration of 2.5 mg three times daily.
 This may be increased by 2.5 mg daily increments until the patient obtains relief of symptoms.
 In most cases excellent results will be obtained with 10 to 20 mg daily.
 5 mg three times a day for 3 days 10 mg three times a day for 3 days 15 mg three times a day for 3 days 20 mg three times a day for 3 days
 Thereafter additional increases may be necessary but the total daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 80 mg daily (20 mg four times a day).
 The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg / kg / day in 3 or 4 divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg / m²bsa / day).
 The initial dose of Kenalog - 10 Injection for intra - articular administration may vary from 2.5 mg to 5 mg for smaller joints and from 5 mg to 15 mg for larger joints, depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 Single injections into several joints, up to a total of 20 mg or more, have been given.
 Multiple sites separated by one centimeter or more may be injected, keeping in mind that the greater the total volume employed the more corticosteroid becomes available for systemic absorption and systemic effects.
 For accuracy of dosage measurement and ease of administration, it is preferable to employ a tuberculin syringe and a small - bore needle (23 - 25 gauge).
 Reference ID: 296155718

 Dosage is usually adjusted within the range of 40 mg to 80 mg, depending upon patient response and duration of relief.
 However, some patients may be well controlled on doses as low as 20 mg or less.
 Hay fever or pollen asthma: Patients with hay fever or pollen asthma who are not responding to pollen administration and other conventional therapy may obtain a remission of symptoms lasting throughout the pollen season after a single injection of 40 mg to 100 mg.
 In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of triamcinolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for one month are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Neuro - Psychiatric).
 The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg / kg / day in 3 or 4 divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg / m²bsa / day).
 A single local injection of triamcinolone acetonide is frequently sufficient, but several injections may be needed for adequate relief of symptoms.
 2.5 mg to 5 mg for smaller joints and from 5 mg to 15 mg for larger joints, depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 For adults, doses up to 10 mg for smaller areas and up to 40 mg for larger areas have usually been sufficient.

 The once daily dosage may be adjusted in increments of 1000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg / day.
 Betaxolol is effective in the treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 5 - 20 mg, while chlorthalidone is effective in doses of 12.5 - 50 mg.
 In clinical trials of betaxolol / chlorthalidone combination therapy using betaxolol doses of 5 - 20 mg and chlorthalidone doses of 12.5 - 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.
 Therapy guided by clinical effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with monotherapy using either betaxolol (usually 10 - 20 mg) or chlorthalidone may be switched to Kerledex 5 / 12.5 mg.
 Subsequent titration (14 - day intervals) could add additional betaxolol, chlorthalidone, or both, using single entity products, Kerledex 5 / 12.5, or Kerledex 10 / 12.5 as appropriate.
 Initial therapy: Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated with the lowest dose of Kerledex, one 5 / 12.5 mg tablet once daily.
 Subsequent titration (14 - day intervals) may be carried out with Kerledex tablets up to the maximum recommended dose of 20 / 25 mg (two 10 / 12.5 mg tablets) once daily, as appropriate.
 The initial dose of Kerlone (betaxolol hydrochloride) in hypertension is ordinarily 10 mg once daily either alone or added to diuretic therapy.
 Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg has not been shown to produce a statistically significant additional antihypertensive effect; but the 40 - mg dose has been studied and is well tolerated.
 In patients with severe renal impairment and those undergoing dialysis the initial dose of Kerlone (betaxolol hydrochloride) is 5 mg once daily.
 If the desired response is not achieved, dosage may be increased by 5 mg / day increments every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 20 mg / day.
 Elderly patients: Consideration should be given to reduction in the starting dose to 5 mg in elderly patients.
 The onset of action of Ketalar is rapid; an intravenous dose of 2 mg / kg (1 mg / lb) of body weight usually produces surgical anesthesia within 30 seconds after injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting five to ten minutes.
 Intramuscular doses, in a range of 9 to 13 mg / kg (4 to 6 mg / lb) usually produce surgical anesthesia within 3 to 4 minutes following injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting 12 to 25 minutes.
 Intravenous Route: The initial dose of Ketalar administered intravenously may range from 1 mg / kg to 4.5 mg / kg (0.5 to 2 mg / lb).
 The average amount required to produce five to ten minutes of surgical anesthesia has been 2 mg / kg (1 mg / lb).
 Alternatively, in adult patients an induction dose of 1 mg to 2 mg / kg intravenous ketamine at a rate of 0.5 mg / kg / min may be used for induction of anesthesia.
 In addition, diazepam in 2 mg to 5 mg doses, administered in a separate syringe over 60 seconds, may be used.
 In most cases, 15 mg of intravenous diazepam or less will suffice.
 The initial dose of Ketalar administered intramuscularly may range from 6.5 to 13 mg / kg (3 to 6 mg / lb).
 A dose of 10 mg / kg (5 mg / lb) will usually produce 12 to 25 minutes of surgical anesthesia.
 Adult patients induced with Ketalar augmented with intravenous diazepam may be maintained on Ketalar given by slow microdrip infusion technique at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg / minute, augmented with diazepam 2 to 5 mg administered intravenously as needed.
 In many cases 20 mg or less of intravenous diazepam total for combined induction and maintenance will suffice.
 To prepare a dilute solution containing 1 mg of ketamine per mL, aseptically transfer 10 mL (50 mg per mL) or 5 mL (100 mg per mL) to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP (Normal Saline) and mix well.
 The resultant solution will contain 1 mg of ketamine per mL.
 If fluid restriction is required, Ketalar can be added to a 250 mL infusion as described above to provide a Ketalar concentration of 2 mg / mL.
 Ketalar 10 mg / mL are not recommended for dilution.
 The onset of action of ketamine hydrochloride is rapid; an intravenous dose of 2 mg / kg (1 mg / lb) of body weight usually produces surgical anesthesia within 30 seconds after injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting five to ten minutes.
 Intramuscular doses, in a range of 9 to 13 mg / kg (4 to 6 mg / lb) usually produce surgical anesthesia within 3 to 4 minutes following injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting 12 to 25 minutes.
 The initial dose of ketamine hydrochloride administered intravenously may range from 1 mg / kg to 4.5 mg / kg (0.5 to 2 mg / lb).
 The average amount required to produce five to ten minutes of surgical anesthesia has been 2 mg / kg (1 mg / lb).
 Alternatively, in adult patients an induction dose of 1 mg to 2 mg / kg intravenous ketamine at a rate of 0.5 mg / kg / min may be used for induction of anesthesia.
 In addition, diazepam in 2 mg to 5 mg doses, administered in a separate syringe over 60 seconds, may be used.
 In most cases, 15 mg of intravenous diazepam or less will suffice.
 The initial dose of ketamine hydrochloride administered intramuscularly may range from 6.5 to 13 mg / kg (3 to 6 mg / lb).
 A dose of 10 mg / kg (5 mg / lb) will usually produce 12 to 25 minutes of surgical anesthesia.
 Adult patients induced with ketamine hydrochloride augmented with intravenous diazepam may be maintained on ketamine hydrochloride given by slow microdrip infusion technique at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg / minute, augmented with diazepam 2 to 5 mg administered intravenously as needed.
 In many cases 20 mg or less of intravenous diazepam total for combined induction and maintenance will suffice.
 To prepare a dilute solution containing 1 mg of ketamine per mL, aseptically transfer 10 mL from a 50 mg per mL vial or 5 mL from a 100 mg per mL vial to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP (Normal Saline) and mix well.
 The resultant solution will contain 1 mg of ketamine per mL.
 If fluid restriction is required, ketamine hydrochloride injection can be added to a 250 mL infusion as described above to provide a ketamine hydrochloride concentration of 2 mg / mL.
 The dosage of KETEK tablets is 800 mg (2 tablets of 400 mg) taken orally once daily for 7 – 10 days in patients 18 years or older.
 In the presence of severe renal impairment (CLCR less than 30 mL / min), including patients who need dialysis, reduce the dosage of KETEK to 600 mg once daily.
 In the presence of severe renal impairment (CLCR less than 30 mL / min), with coexisting hepatic impairment, reduce the dosage of KETEK to 400 mg once daily.
 Initiate dosing at 50 mg twice daily.
 The maximum recommended total daily dose is 200 mg.

 The recommended dose for KHEDEZLA is 50 mg once daily, with or without food.
 In clinical studies, doses of 50 mg to 400 mg per day were shown to be effective, although no additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg per day and adverse reactions and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses.
 The maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate renal impairment (24 - hr creatinine clearance [CrCl] = 30 to 50 mL / min, Cockcroft - Gault [C - G]) is 50 mg per day.
 The maximum recommended dose in patients with severe renal impairment (24 - hr CrCl less than 30 mL / min, C - G) or end - stage renal disease (ESRD) is 50 mg every other day.
 The recommended dose in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 50 mg per day.
 Dose escalation above 100 mg per day is not recommended [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with KHEDEZLA is unclear.
 The recommended dose of Kineret for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 100 mg / day administered daily by subcutaneous injection.
 The recommended starting dose of Kineret is 1 - 2 mg / kg for NOMID patients.
 The dose can be individually adjusted to a maximum of 8 mg / kg daily to control active inflammation.
 Adjust doses in 0.5 to 1.0 mg / kg increments.
 Each syringe is intended for a single use.
 Physicians should consider administration of the prescribed dose of Kineret every other day for patients who have severe renal insufficiency or end stage renal disease (defined as creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min, as estimated from serum creatinine levels) [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 To reconstitute, aseptically add 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP to the vial; any additional dilution should be made with Sodium Chloride Injection USP, 0.9%.
 For prompt contraction of the gallbladder, a dose of 0.02 mcg sincallde per kg (1.4 mcg / 70 kg) is Injected intravenously over a 30 - to 60 - second interval; If satisfactory contraction of the gallbladder does not occur in 15 minutes, a second dose, 0.04 mcg sincalide per kg, may be administered.
 To reduce the intestinal side effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS), an intravenous infusion may be prepared at a dose of 0.12 mcg / kg in 100 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection USP and given at a rate of 2 mL per minute; alternatively, an intramuscular dose of 0.1 mcg / kg may be given.
 For the Secretin - Kinevac (sincalide) test of pancreatic function, the patient receives a dose of 0.25 units secretin per kg by intravenous infusion over a 60 - mlnute period.
 For example, the total dose for a 70 kg patient is 1.4 mcg of sincalide; therefore, dilute 1.4 mL of reconstituted Kinevac (sincalide) solution to 30 mL with Sodium Chloride Injection USP and administer at a rate of 1 mL per minute.
 The recommended dose is 0.04 mcg sincalide per kg (2.8 mcg / 70 kg) injected intravenously over a 30 - to 60 - second interval; if satisfactory transit of the barium meal has not occurred in 30 minutes, a second dose of 0.04 mcg sincalide per kg may be administered.
 For reduction of side effects, a 30 - minute IV infusion of sincalide [0.12 mcg per kg (8.4 mcg / 70 kg) diluted to approximately 100 mL with Sodium Chloride Injection USP] may be administered.
 KINRIX is to be administered as a 0.5 - mL dose by intramuscular injection.
 The average daily adult dose of the resin is 15 g to 60 g. This is best provided by administering 15 g (approximately 4levelteaspoons)of Kionex® one to four times daily.
 One gram of Kionex® contains 4.1 mEq of sodium; one level teaspoon contains approximately 3.5 g of Kionex® and 15 mEq of sodium.
 (A heaping teaspoon may contain as much as 10 g to 12 g of Kionex® .)
 Since thein vivoefficiency of sodium - potassium exchange resins is approximately 33 percent, about one third of the resin's actual sodium content is being delivered to the body.
 In smaller children and infants, lower doses should be employed by using as a guide a rate of 1 mEq of potassium per gram of resin as the basis for calculation.
 The amount of fluid usually ranges from 20 mL to 100 mL, depending on the dose, or may be simply determined by allowing 3 mL to 4 mL per gram of resin.
 The resin may also be given, although with less effective results, in an enema consisting (for adults) of 30 g to 50 g every six hours.
 Each dose is administered as a warm emulsion (at body temperature) in 100 mL of aqueous vehicle.
 The suspension is flushed with 50 mL or 100 mL of fluid, following which the tube is clamped and left in place.
 Two quarts of flushing solution may be necessary.
 Tablet: 200 mg ribociclib (equivalent to 254.40 mg ribociclib succinate)
 Each film - coated tablet contains 200 mg of ribociclib free base.
 Blister pack (21 tablets) – each blister pack contains 21 tablets (200 mg per tablet) (600 mg daily dose)
 Blister pack (14 tablets) – each blister pack contains 14 tablets (200 mg per tablet) (400 mg daily dose)
 Blister pack (21 tablets) – each blister pack contains 21 tablets (200 mg per tablet) (200 mg daily dose)
 Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F).
 The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg / day divided into three doses.
 Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase.
 Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.
 In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg / kg / day but not to exceed 0.05 mg / kg / day given in two or three divided doses.
 Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25 to 0.5 mg every third day until a daily maintenance dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg / kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase.
 The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg bid.
 An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg / day may be made after 3 days.
 The recommended dose of 1 mg / day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg / day.
 Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg / day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg / day dose and were associated with more adverse effects.
 Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg / day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg bid every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired.
 To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.
 Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg bid every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.
 Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient but is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day for the prevention of hypokalemia to 40 - 100 mEq per day or more for the treatment of potassium depletion.
 The usual adult dose is 20 - 100 mEq of potassium per day (one KLOR - CON® 20 mEq packet 1 to 5 times daily after meals or one KLOR - CON® / 25 25 mEq packet 1 to 4 times daily after meals).
 Some patients with low titer inhibitors, (10 Bethesda Units) can be successfully treated with factor VIII without a resultant anamnestic rise in inhibitor titer.12 Factor VIII levels and clinical response to treatment must be assessed to insure adequate response.
 Mild superficial or early hemorrhages may respond to a single dose of 10 IU per kg,4 leading to an in vivo rise of approximately 20% in the factor VIII level.
 For more serious bleeding episodes (e.g., definite hemarthroses, known trauma), the factor VIII level should be raised to 30% – 50% by administering approximately 15 - 25 IU per kg.
 If further therapy is required, repeated doses of 10 - 15 IU per kg every 8 - 12 hours may be given.16
 For major surgical procedures, the factor VIII level should be raised to approximately 100% by giving a preoperative dose of 50 IU / kg.
 The rate of administration should be adapted to the response of the individual patient, but administration of the entire dose in 5 to 10 minutes is generally well - tolerated.
 Dosage (units) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (IU / dL or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU / kg per IU / dL)
 IU / dL (or % normal)=Total Dose (IU) / body weight (kg) x 2 [IU / dL] / [IU / kg]
 The recommended dose for routine prophylaxis is 25 IU / kg of body weight every other day.5
 The recommended starting dose of KOMBIGLYZE XR in patients who need 5 mg of saxagliptin and who are not currently treated with metformin is 5 mg saxagliptin / 500 mg metformin extended - release once daily with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to metformin.
 Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin in combination with metformin extended - release may be treated with KOMBIGLYZE XR 2.5 mg / 1000 mg.
 Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin who are either metformin naive or who require a dose of metformin higher than 1000 mg should use the individual components.
 The maximum daily recommended dosage is 5 mg for saxagliptin and 2000 mg for metformin extended - release.
 The maximum recommended dosage of saxagliptin is 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 / 5 (CYP3A4 / 5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin).
 For these patients, limit the KOMBIGLYZE XR dosage to 2.5 mg / 1000 mg once daily [see Recommended Dosage above, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 One IU is defined as the activity present in 1 mL of fresh, normal plasma.
 Levels of factor IX of 30 to 40 percent are considered effective in stopping hemorrhages.
 1 Bleeds in life - or limb - threatening areas require factor IX levels of 50 to 80 percent which should be maintained at 30 to 40 percent for a few days.
 1 The desired hemostatic plasma level in surgical patients for minor procedures or invasive dental surgery is between 30 and 40 percent of normal.
 1 This can be achieved by a dosage not exceeding 30 to 40 units per kg body weight.
 1
 Thus, in order to bring a 70 kg patient from 0% to 50% of normal, the patient would require 70 x 50 x 1.0 = 3500 IU or 50 IU / kg body weight.
 For prophylaxis against hemorrhage during times of extensive physical activity, the plasma factor IX levels should be raised to 15 to 30 percent.
 Additional Factor IX Complex, Konyne (factor ix complex) ® 80 should be administered when a patient on prophylaxis is exposed to trauma or surgery.
 For treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) who have inhibitors to factor VIII, the recommended dose should be 75 IU / kg.
 9
 The recommended starting dose is 300 mg orally once daily.
 Korlym must be given as a single daily dose.
 The daily dose of Korlym may be increased in 300 mg increments.
 The dose of Korlym may be increased to a maximum of 1200 mg once daily but should not exceed 20 mg / kg per day.
 If Korlym treatment is interrupted, it should be reinitiated at the lowest dose (300 mg).
 The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg. [See Renal Impairment and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]
 The maximum dose should be limited to 600 mg. Korlym should not be used in severe hepatic impairment.
 Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal or IU / dL) x reciprocal of expected / observed recovery (e.g., 0.5 for a recovery of 2 IU / dL per IU / kg)
 Estimated increment of Factor VIII (IU / dL or % of normal) = [Total dose (IU) / body weight (kg)] x 2 (IU / dL per IU / kg)

 To mimic real life, the pediatric and adult patients and the caregivers were given minimal training, which included participants performing a supervised reconstitution and later performing a single unaided reconstitution.
 If the dose requires more than one vial, reconstitute each vial as described above with the diluent syringe provided.
 The usual adult dosage is 10 g to 20 g of lactulose daily.
 The dose may be increased to 40 g daily if necessary.
 The recommended dose and regimen of KRYSTEXXA for adult patients is 8 mg (uricase protein) given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks.
 Withdraw 1 mL of KRYSTEXXA from the vial into a sterile syringe.
 Discard any unused portion of product remaining in the 2 mL vial.
 Inject into a single 250 mL bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for intravenous infusion.
 KRYSTEXXA diluted in infusion bags is stable for 4 hours at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) and at room temperature (20° to 25°C, 68° to 77°F).
 Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and consider discontinuing treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg / dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg / dL are observed.
 Patients 1 month to 6 years: The recommended starting dose of Kuvan is 10 mg / kg taken once daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Patients 7 years and older: The recommended starting dose of Kuvan is 10 to 20 mg / kg taken once daily.
 If a 10 mg / kg per day starting dose is used, then response to therapy is determined by change in blood Phe following treatment with Kuvan at 10 mg / kg per day for a period of up to 1 month.
 If blood Phe does not decrease from baseline at 10 mg / kg per day, the dose may be increased to 20 mg / kg per day.
 Patients whose blood Phe does not decrease after 1 month of treatment at 20 mg / kg per day are non - responders and treatment with Kuvan should be discontinued in these patients.
 If a 20 mg / kg per day starting dose is used, then response to therapy is determined by change in blood Phe following treatment with Kuvan at 20 mg / kg per day for a period of 1 month.
 Once responsiveness to Kuvan has been established, the dosage may be adjusted within the range of 5 to 20 mg / kg per day according to response to therapy.
 A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, but two doses should not be taken on the same day.
 Kuvan tablets may be swallowed either as whole tablets or dissolved in 120 to 240 mL of water or apple juice and taken orally within 15 minutes of dissolution.
 Kuvan powder for oral solution should be dissolved in 120 to 240 mL of water or apple juice and taken orally within 30 minutes of dissolution.
 For infants weighing 10 kg or less, Kuvan can be dissolved in as little as 5 mL of water or apple juice and a portion of this solution corresponding to a 10 mg / kg dose may be administered orally via an oral dosing syringe.
 Table 1 provides dosing information for infants at the recommended starting dose of 10 mg / kg per day.
 Refer to Table 2 for dosing information at 20 mg / kg per day if dosage adjustment is needed.

 One LACRISERT (cellulose) ophthalmic insert in each eye once daily is usually sufficient to relieve the symptoms associated with moderate to severe dry eye syndromes.
 Adult: The usual adult, oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 mL, containing 20 g to 30 g of lactulose) three or four times daily.
 The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily.
 Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of lactulose solution may be used to induce the rapid laxation indicated in the initial phase of the therapy of portal - systemic encephalopathy.
 As with adults, the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily.
 On the basis of information available, the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2.5 to 10 mL in divided doses.
 For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 mL.
 Three hundred mL of lactulose solution should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes.
 There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life - threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of LAMICTAL with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of LAMICTAL, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for LAMICTAL.
 For dosing considerations for LAMICTAL in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Table 1, Table 2, Table 5, Table 6, and Table 13.
 Therefore, dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with LAMICTAL based on the concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Table 1 or Table 5).
 (1) Taking Estrogen - Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir / ritonavir and atazanavir / ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY], the maintenance dose of LAMICTAL will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2 - fold over the recommended target maintenance dose to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level.
 (2) Starting Estrogen - Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women taking a stable dose of LAMICTAL and not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir / ritonavir and atazanavir / ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY], the maintenance dose will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2 - fold to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level.
 The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg / day every week.
 Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Table 1 or Table 5) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases.
 Initial doses of LAMICTAL should be based on patients' concomitant medications (see Tables 1 - 3 or Table 5); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 This section provides specific dosing recommendations for patients older than 12 years and patients aged 2 to 12 years.
 Within each of these age - groups, specific dosing recommendations are provided depending upon concomitant AEDs or other concomitant medications (see Table 1 for patients older than 12 years and Table 2 for patients aged 2 to 12 years).
 Maintenance doses in patients weighing less than 30 kg, regardless of age or concomitant AED, may need to be increased as much as 50%, based on clinical response.
 The smallest available strength of LAMICTAL chewable dispersible tablets is 2 mg, and only whole tablets should be administered.
 Table 2: Escalation Regimen for LAMICTAL in Patients Aged 2 to 12 Years With Epilepsy
 Table 3: The Initial Weight - Based Dosing Guide for Patients Aged 2 to 12 Years Taking Valproate (Weeks 1 to 4) With Epilepsy
 In patients receiving multidrug regimens employing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone without valproate, maintenance doses of adjunctive LAMICTAL as high as 700 mg / day have been used.
 In patients receiving valproate alone, maintenance doses of adjunctive LAMICTAL as high as 200 mg / day have been used.
 The recommended maintenance dose of LAMICTAL as monotherapy is 500 mg / day given in 2 divided doses.
 After achieving a dose of 500 mg / day of LAMICTAL using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant enzyme - inducing AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4 - week period.
 The target dose of LAMICTAL is 200 mg / day (100 mg / day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg / day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir / ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine).
 In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg / day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg / day compared with 200 mg / day [see Clinical Studies].
 Accordingly, doses above 200 mg / day are not recommended.
 The dose of LAMICTAL may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated.
 The benefit of continuing treatment in patients who had been stabilized in an 8 - to 16 - week open - label phase with LAMICTAL was established in 2 randomized, placebo - controlled clinical maintenance trials [see Clinical Studies].
 To disperse LAMICTAL chewable dispersible tablets, add the tablets to a small amount of liquid (1 teaspoon, or enough to cover the medication).
 There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life - threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of LAMICTAL XR with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of LAMICTAL XR, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for LAMICTAL XR.
 For dosing considerations for LAMICTAL XR in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Table 1 and Table 5.
 To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended maintenance dosage range of LAMICTAL XR as monotherapy is 250 to 300 mg given once daily.
 After achieving a dose of 500 mg / day of LAMICTAL XR using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant enzyme - inducing AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4 - week period.
 Two weeks after completion of withdrawal of the enzyme - inducing AED, the dosage of LAMICTAL XR may be decreased no faster than 100 mg / day each week to achieve the monotherapy maintenance dosage range of 250 to 300 mg / day.
 After achieving a dosage of 250 to 300 mg / day of LAMICTAL XR using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4 - week period.

 For the treatment of proven dapsone - resistant leprosy, Lamprene (clofazimine) should be given at a dosage of 100 mg daily in combination with one or more other antileprosy drugs for 3 years, followed by monotherapy with 100 mg of Lamprene (clofazimine) daily.
 Where prolonged corticosteroid therapy becomes necessary, Lamprene (clofazimine) administered at dosages of 100 to 200 mg daily for up to 3 months may be useful in eliminating or reducing corticosteroid requirements.
 Dosages above 200 mg daily are not recommended, and the dosage should be tapered to 100 mg daily as quickly as possible after the reactive episode is controlled.
 For adults, no more than 500 mcg of LANOXIN Injection should be injected into a single site.

 Larin Fe 1.5 / 30 provides a continuous administration regimen consisting of 21 green tablets of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and 7 brown non - hormone containing tablets of ferrous fumarate.
 The patient takes one green tablet daily for 21 days.
 Upon completion of all 21 green tablets, and without interruption, the patient takes one brown tablet daily for 7 days.
 Adhering to this regimen of one green tablet daily for 21 days, followed without interruption by one brown tablet daily for seven days, the patient will start all subsequent cycles on a Sunday.
 She starts taking one green tablet daily, beginning with the first green tablet in the top row.
 For all subsequent cycles, the patient begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the eighth day after taking her last green tablet, again starting with the first tablet in the top row after placing the appropriate day label strip over the preprinted days on the tablet dispenser.
 Following this regimen of 21 green tablets and 7 brown tablets, the patient will start all subsequent cycles on the same day of the week as the first course.
 Menstruation usually begins two or three days, but may begin as late as the fourth or fifth day, after the brown tablets have been started.
 If the patient forgets to take one or more green tablets, the following is suggested:
 One tablet is missed
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (week 1 or week 2)
 Two consecutive tablets are missed (week 3)
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one green tablet is missed, the possibility of spotting or bleeding is increased.
 This is particularly likely to occur if two or more consecutive green tablets are missed.
 If the patient forgets to take any of the seven brown tablets in week four, those brown tablets that were missed are discarded and one brown tablet is taken each day until the pack is empty.
 The recommended dose of LARTRUVO is 15 mg / kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 The usual initial dose of LASIX is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose.
 The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained.
 The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (eg, at 8 am and 2 pm).
 The dose of LASIX may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg / day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.
 Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving LASIX on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.
 When doses exceeding 80 mg / day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable.
 The usual initial dose of oral LASIX in pediatric patients is 2 mg / kg body weight, given as a single dose.

 Because absorption is saturable, oral administration of doses greater than 25 mg is not recommended.
 Leucovorin 15 mg (10 mg / m2) should be administered IM, IV, or PO every 6 hours until serum methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M. In the presence of gastrointestinal toxicity, nausea, or vomiting, leucovorin should be administered parenterally.
 If the 24 hour serum creatinine has increased 50% over baseline or if the 24 hour methotrexate level is greater than 5 x 10 - 6 M or the 48 hour level is greater than 9 x 10 - 7 M, the dose of leucovorin should be increased to 150 mg (100 mg / m2) IV every 3 hours until the methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M. Doses greater then 25 mg should be given parenterally (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 The recommended dose of leucovorin to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 to 15 mg of leucovorin per day has been recommended by some investigators.
 If significant clinical toxicity is observed, leucovorin rescue should be extended for an additional 24 hours (total 14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses of therapy.
 This five - day treatment course may be repeated at 4 week (28 - day) intervals, for 2 courses and then repeated at 4 to 5 week (28 to 35 day) intervals provided that the patient has completely recovered from the toxic effects of the prior treatment course.
 Leucovorin (leucovorin calcium) Rescue After High - Dose Methotrexate Therapy: The recommendations for leucovorin (leucovorin calcium) rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 to 15 grams / m2 administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (see methotrexate package insert for full prescribing information).4 Leucovorin (leucovorin calcium) rescue at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg / m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion.

 Two mg of Levo - Dromoran (levorphanol) is approximately equivalent to 10 to 15 mg of morphine or 100 mg of meperidine.
 The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg / kg / day (e.g., 100 - 125 mcg / day for a 70 kg adult).
 Older patients may require less than 1 mcg / kg / day.
 Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg / day are seldom required.
 An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg / day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and / or drug interactions.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day, with gradual dose increments at 4 - 6 week intervals.
 In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day with increases of 25 mcg / day every 2 - 4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine in newborn infants is 10 - 15 mcg / kg / day.
 A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg / day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4 - 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment.
 In infants with very low ( < 5 mcg / dL) or undetectable serum T4 concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium.
 However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2 - 4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.
 Subclinical Hypothyroidism - If this condition is treated, lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg / kg / day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level.
 Generally, TSH is suppressed to < 0.1 mU / L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg / kg / day.
 The recommendations for levoleucovorin rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 grams / m² administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (see methotrexate package insert for full prescribing information).
 levoleucovorin rescue at a dose of 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg / m²) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion.
 levoleucovorin administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH of 7.0 or greater) should be continued until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10 - 8 M (0.05 micromolar).
 If significant clinical toxicity is observed, levoleucovorin rescue should be extended for an additional 24 hours (total of 14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses of therapy.
 levoleucovorin 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg / m²) should be administered IV every 6 hours until the serum methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M.
 If the 24 hour serum creatinine has increased 50% over baseline or if the 24 hour methotrexate level is greater than 5 x 10 - 6 M or the 48 hour level is greater than 9 x 10 - 7 M, the dose of levoleucovorin should be increased to 50 mg / m² IV every 3 hours until the methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M. Hydration (3 L / day) and urinary alkalinization with NaHCO3 should be employed concomitantly.
 The recommendations for levoleucovorin injection rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 grams / m² administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (see methotrexate package insert for full prescribing information).
 Levoleucovorin injection rescue at a dose of 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg / m²) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion.
 Levoleucovorin injection administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH of 7.0 or greater) should be continued until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10 - 8 M (0.05 micromolar).
 Table 1: Guidelines for Levoleucovorin Injection Dosage and Administration
 If significant clinical toxicity is observed, levoleucovorin injection rescue should be extended for an additional 24 hours (total of 14 doses over 84 hours) in subsequent courses of therapy.
 Levoleucovorin injection 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg / m²) should be administered IV every 6 hours until the serum methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M.
 If the 24 hour serum creatinine has increased 50% over baseline or if the 24 hour methotrexate level is greater than 5 x 10 - 6 M or the 48 hour level is greater than 9 x 10 - 7 M, the dose of levoleucovorin injection should be increased to 50 mg / m² IV every 3 hours until the methotrexate level is less than 10 - 8 M. Hydration (3 L / day) and urinary alkalinization with NaHCO3 should be employed concomitantly.
 Add a 4 mL ampul (4 mg) of LEVOPHED to 1,000 mL of a 5 percent dextrose containing solution.
 Each mL of this dilution contains 4 mcg of the base of LEVOPHED.
 After observing the response to an initial dose of 2 mL to 3 mL (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low normal blood pressure (usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation to vital organs.
 The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.5 mL to 1 mL per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base).
 Occasionally much larger or even enormous daily doses (as high as 68 mg base or 17 ampuls) may be necessary if the patient remains hypotensive, but occult blood volume depletion should always be suspected and corrected when present.
 If large volumes of fluid (dextrose) are needed at a flow rate that would involve an excessive dose of the pressor agent per unit of time, a solution more dilute than 4 mcg per mL should be used.
 On the other hand, when large volumes of fluid are clinically undesirable, a concentration greater than 4 mcg per mL may be necessary.
 For a DAY 1 START, count the first day of menstrual flow as Day 1 and the first tablet (white) is then taken on Day 1.

 In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e. g. , 0.1 to either 0.5 or 1.0 mU / L) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer.
 An initial intravenous loading dose of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection between 300 to 500 mcg, followed by once daily intravenous maintenance doses between 50 and 100 mcg, should be administered, as clinically indicated, until the patient can tolerate oral therapy.
 Based on medical practice, the relative bioavailability between oral and intravenous administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is estimated to be from 48 to 74%.
 Reconstitute the lyophilized Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection by aseptically adding 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP only.
 The resultant solution will have a final concentration of approximately 20 mcg per mL and 40 mcg per mL for the 100 mcg and 200 mcg vials, respectively.

 The usual dose is one drop instilled in affected eyes four times per day.
 Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day.
 One blue tablet should be taken daily for 24 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily for 2 consecutive days, followed by one brown tablet daily for 2 consecutive days.
 The dosage of Lo / Ovral is one tablet daily for 21 consecutive days per menstrual cycle according to prescribed schedule.
 During the first cycle of medication, the patient is instructed to take one Lo / Ovral tablet daily for twenty - one consecutive days, beginning on the first day (Day 1 Start) of her menstrual cycle or on the Sunday after her period begins (Sunday Start).
 When the patient is switching from a 28 - day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Lo / Ovral on the day after her last tablet.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken.
 Any time the patient misses two or more tablets, she should also use another method of contraception until she has taken a tablet daily for seven consecutive days.
 Locoid® (hydrocortisone butyrate) Solution, 0.1% should be applied to the affected area as a thin film two or three times daily depending on the severity of the condition.

 The recommended total daily dose of etodolac capsules for acute pain is up to 1000 mg, given as 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8 hours.
 Doses of etodolac greater than 1000 mg / day have not been adequately evaluated in well - controlled clinical trials.
 The recommended starting dose of etodolac capsules for the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis is: 300 mg b.i.d., t.i.d., or 400 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg b.i.d.
 A lower dose of 600 mg / day may suffice for long - term administration.
 Physicians should be aware that doses above 1000 mg / day have not been adequately evaluated in well - controlled clinical trials.
 Most patients respond to a 1:10 proportion of carbidopa and levodopa, provided the daily dosage of carbidopa is 70 mg or more a day.
 The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa should not exceed 200 mg, since clinical experience with larger dosages is limited.
 Some patients taking carbidopa - levodopa may not have adequate reduction in nausea and vomiting when the dosage of carbidopa is less than 70 mg a day, and the dosage of levodopa is less than 700 mg a day.
 When these patients are taking carbidopa - levodopa, 25 mg of LODOSYN may be given with the first dose of carbidopa - levodopa each day.
 Additional doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg may be given during the day with each dose of carbidopalevodopa.
 The maximum daily dosage of carbidopa, given as LODOSYN and as carbidopa - levodopa), should not exceed 200 mg.
 In these patients, LODOSYN (carbidopa) should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg three or four times a day.
 Dosage of LODOSYN may be adjusted by adding or omitting one - half or one tablet a day.
 When therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual daily dosage may be resumed as soon as the patient is able to take medication orally.

 The usual adult dose is one tablet three times a day ½ hour before meals.
 This tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose.
 The recommended initial dosage is two Lomotil tablets four times daily or 10 ml (two regular teaspoonfuls) of Lomotil liquid four times daily (20 mg per day).
 Control may often be maintained with as little as 5 mg (two tablets or 10 ml of liquid) daily.
 If clinical improvement of chronic diarrhea after treatment with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is not observed within 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration.
 The recommended initial total daily dosage of Lomotil liquid for children is 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg, administered in four divided doses.
 The recommended initial dosage of LONITEN Tablets is 5 mg of minoxidil given as a single daily dose.
 Daily dosage can be increased to 10, 20 and then to 40 mg in single or divided doses if required for optimum blood pressure control.
 The effective dosage range is usually 10 to 40 mg per day.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 100 mg per day.
 The initial dosage is 0.2 mg / kg minoxidil as a single daily dose.
 The dosage may be increased in 50 to 100% increments until optimum blood pressure control is achieved.
 The effective dosage range is usually 0.25 to 1.0 mg / kg / day.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 50 mg daily (see Pediatric Use under PRECAUTIONS).
 If supine diastolic pressure has been reduced less than 30 mm Hg, the drug need be administered only once a day; if supine diastolic pressure has been reduced more than 30 mm Hg, the daily dosage should be divided into two equal parts.
 Diuretics have been used at the following dosages when starting therapy with LONITEN: hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg, b.i.d.)
 or other thiazides at equieffective dosage; chlorthalidone (50 to 100 mg, once daily); furosemide (40 mg, b.i.d.).
 When therapy with LONITEN is begun, the dosage of a beta - adrenergic receptor blocking drug should be the equivalent of 80 to 160 mg of propranolol per day in divided doses.
 If beta - blockers are contraindicated, methyldopa (250 to 750 mg, b.i.d.)
 Limited clinical experience indicates that clonidine may also be used to prevent tachycardia induced by LONITEN; the usual dosage is 0.1 to 0.2 mg twice daily.
 The recommended starting dose of LONSURF is 35 mg / m² up to a maximum of 80 mg per dose (based on the trifluridine component) orally twice daily within one hour of completion of morning and evening meals on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12 of each 28 - day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 Round dose to the nearest 5 mg increment.
 After recovery, resume LONSURF after reducing the dose by 5 mg / m² / dose from the previous dose level, if the following occur:
 A maximum of 3 dose reductions are permitted to a minimum dose of 20 mg / m² twice daily.
 The recommended dose for adults is 1200 mg administered in two divided doses 30 minutes before the morning and evening meals (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 Begin treatment in this early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of Lopressor each; give the injections at approximately 2 - minute intervals.
 In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), initiate Lopressor tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours.
 Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg orally twice daily.
 Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on Lopressor tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows.
 Hydrochlorothiazide is usually given at a dosage of 12.5 to 50 mg per day.
 The usual initial dosage of Lopressor is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses.
 The effective dosage range is 100 to 450 mg per day.
 While once - daily dosing is effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24 - hour period, and larger or more frequent daily doses may be required.
 The following dosage schedule may be used to administer from 100 to 200 mg of Lopressor per day and from 25 to 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day:
 Dosing regimens that exceed 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day are not recommended.

 Apply one to two drops of LOTEMAX into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye four times daily beginning the day after surgery and continuing throughout the first 2 weeks of the post - operative period.
 The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is 10 mg once a day.
 The usual maintenance dosage range is 20 - 40 mg per day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses.
 A dose of 80 mg gives an increased response, but experience with this dose is limited.
 Total daily doses above 80 mg have not been evaluated.
 If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg Lotensin should be used to avoid excessive hypotension.
 In children, doses of Lotensin between 0.1 and 0.6 mg / kg once daily have been studied, and doses greater than 0.1 mg / kg were shown to reduce blood pressure (see Pharmacodynamics).
 Based on this, the recommended starting dose of Lotensin is 0.2 mg / kg once per day as monotherapy.
 Doses above 0.6 mg / kg (or in excess of 40 mg daily) have not been studied in pediatric patients.
 Treatment with Lotensin is not advised for children below the age of 6 years (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use) and in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL, as there are insufficient data available to support a dosing recommendation in these groups.
 For patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min / 1.73 m² (serum creatinine > 3 mg / dL), the recommended initial dose is 5 mg Lotensin once daily.
 Dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum total daily dose of 40 mg (see WARNINGS).
 Add 75 mL of Ora - Plus®* oral suspending vehicle to an amber polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle containing fifteen Lotensin 20 mg tablets, and shake for at least 2 minutes.
 Add 75 mL of Ora - Sweet®* oral syrup vehicle to the bottle and shake the suspension to disperse the ingredients.
 The maximum recommended dose is 20mg / 25mg.
 The usual recommended starting dose is 10 / 12.5 mg once daily to control blood pressure.
 The recommended initial dose of Lotrel is 1 capsule of amlodipine 2.5 mg / benazepril 10 mg orally once - daily.
 If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, the dose may be titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg / benazepril 40 mg once - daily.
 Amlodipine is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 2.5 to 10 mg while benazepril is effective in doses of 10 to 80 mg.
 In clinical trials of amlodipine / benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5 to 10 mg and benazepril doses of 10 to 40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups.
 Lotrel is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than or equal to 30 mL / min.
 No dose adjustment of Lotrel is required in patients with CrCl greater than 30 mL / min / 1.73m² (serum creatinine roughly less than or equal to 3 mg / dL or 265 micromol / L) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Usual Dosage in Adults: To lower the risk of constipation, LOTRONEX (alosetron hydrochloride) should be started at a dosage of 0.5 mg twice a day.
 Patients well controlled on 0.5 mg twice a day may be maintained on this regimen.
 If, after 4 weeks, the 0.5 - mg twice - daily dosage is well tolerated but does not adequately control IBS symptoms, then the dosage can be increased to up to 1 mg twice a day, the dose used in controlled clinical trials (see Clinical Trials).
 LOTRONEX (alosetron hydrochloride) should be discontinued in patients who have not had adequate control of IBS symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment with 1 mg twice a day.

 After cleaning the injection site with an alcohol swab, the intramuscular injection should be performed by inserting the needle at a 90 degree angle into the gluteal area, anterior thigh, or deltoid; injection sites should be alternated.
 The recommended dose of LUPRON DEPOT is 7.5 mg for 1 - month administration, incorporated in a depot formulation.
 Incorporated in a depot formulation, the lyophilized microspheres are to be reconstituted and administered every 4 weeks as a single intramuscular injection.
 Release the diluent by SLOWLY PUSHING (6 to 8 seconds) the plunger until the first stopper is at the blue line in the middle of the barrel.
 LUPRON DEPOT - PED is administered as a single intramuscular injection once a month.
 11.25 mg or 15 mg at the next monthly injection).
 Release the diluent by SLOWLY PUSHING (6 to 8 seconds) the plunger until the first stopper is at the blue line in the middle of the barrel.
 After cleaning the injection site with an alcohol swab, the intramuscular injection should be performed by inserting the needle at a 90 degree angle into the gluteal area, anterior thigh, or shoulder; injection sites should be alternated.
 In adults aged 18 to < 65 years who are healthy or have mild systemic disease (ASA P1 or P2)1, the standard dosing regimen of LUSEDRA (fospropofol disodium injection) is an initial intravenous bolus of 6.5 mg / kg followed by supplemental doses of 1.6 mg / kg intravenously (25% of initial dosage) as needed to achieve the desired level of sedation as shown in Table 1.
 No initial dose should exceed 16.5 mL; no supplemental dose should exceed 4 mL.
 The dosage of Lutera is one white tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to the prescribed schedule.
 One white tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 One white tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 The patient begins her next and all subsequent courses of tablets on the day after taking her last peach tablet.
 If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a nonhormonal back - up method of birth control until she has taken a white tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 When the patient is switching from a 28 - day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Lutera on the day after her last tablet.
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two white tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled white tablets are missed.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken.
 The recommended starting dose for Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in adult patients is 50 mg, administered as a single daily dose at bedtime.
 In the controlled clinical trials establishing the effectiveness of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in OCD, patients were titrated within a dose range of 100 to 300 mg / day.
 Consequently, the dose should be increased in 50 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved, not to exceed 300 mg per day.
 It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 100 mg should be given in two divided doses.
 The recommended starting dose for Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in pediatric populations (ages 8 - 17 years) is 25 mg, administered as a single daily dose at bedtime.
 In a controlled clinical trial establishing the effectiveness of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in OCD, pediatric patients (ages 8 - 17) were titrated within a dose range of 50 to 200 mg / day.
 The maximum dose in children up to age 11 should not exceed 200 mg / day.
 Dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit.
 The dose should be increased in 25 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved.
 It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 50 mg should be given in two divided doses.
 If the two divided doses are not equal, the larger dose should be given at bedtime.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets is unclear.
 The recommended starting dose is 100 mg at bedtime, with weekly increases of 50 mg as tolerated to maximum therapeutic benefit, not to exceed 300 mg per day.
 Consequently, it may be appropriate to titrate slowly following the initial dose of 100 mg in these patient groups.
 Although the efficacy of LUVOX CR Capsules beyond 12 weeks of dosing has not been documented in controlled trials, OCD is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with LUVOX CR is unclear.
 The dosage of LYBREL (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradol tablets) is one yellow tablet daily without any tablet - free interval.
 Table 4
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered.
 Lymphazurin™ 1% (isosulfan blue) is to be administered subcutaneously, one - half (1 / 2) ml into three (3) interdigital spaces of each extremity per study.
 A maximum dose of 3 ml (30 mg) isosulfan blue is, therefore, injected.
 The recommended dose of Lynparza is 400 mg (eight 50 mg capsules) taken orally twice daily with or without food, for a total daily dose of 800 mg.
 The recommended dose reduction is to 200 mg (four 50 mg capsules) taken twice daily, for a total daily dose of 400 mg.
 If a further final dose reduction is required, then reduce to 100 mg (two 50 mg capsules) taken twice daily, for a total daily dose of 200 mg.
 If the inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the Lynparza dose to 150 mg (three 50 mg capsules) taken twice daily for a strong CYP3A inhibitor or 200 mg (four 50 mg capsules) taken twice daily for a moderate CYP3A inhibitor [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 In patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 31 - 50 mL / min) the recommended dose reduction is to 300 mg (six 50 mg capsules) taken twice daily, for a total daily dose of 600 mg.
 The maximum recommended dose of LYRICA is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg / day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL / min.
 Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg / day).
 The dose may be increased to 300 mg / day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.
 Although LYRICA was also studied at 600 mg / day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated.
 In view of the dose - dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg / day is not recommended [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The recommended dose of LYRICA is 75 to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg / day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL / min.
 Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg / day).
 The dose may be increased to 300 mg / day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.
 Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg / day, and who are able to tolerate LYRICA, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day, or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg / day).
 In view of the dose - dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, reserve dosing above 300 mg / day for those patients who have on - going pain and are tolerating 300 mg daily [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 LYRICA at doses of 150 to 600 mg / day has been shown to be effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in adults.
 Administer the total daily dose in two or three divided doses.
 In general, it is recommended that patients be started on a total daily dose no greater than 150 mg / day (75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day).
 Based on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 600 mg / day.
 The recommended dose of LYRICA for fibromyalgia is 300 to 450 mg / day.
 Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg / day).
 The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg / day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.
 Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg / day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg / day).
 Although LYRICA was also studied at 600 mg / day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional benefit and this dose was less well tolerated.
 In view of the dose - dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 450 mg / day is not recommended [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The recommended dose range of LYRICA for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury is 150 to 600 mg / day.
 The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg / day).
 The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg / day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.
 Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate LYRICA may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day [see Clinical Studies].
 Then refer to Table 1 to determine the corresponding renal adjusted dose.
 (For example: A patient initiating LYRICA therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL / min), receives a total daily dose of 150 mg / day pregabalin.
 Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL / min would receive a total daily dose of 75 mg / day pregabalin administered in two or three divided doses.)
 The oral solution is 20 mg pregabalin per milliliter (mL) and prescriptions should be written in milligrams (mg).
 The pharmacist will calculate the applicable dose in mL for dispensing (e.g., 150 mg equals 7.5 mL oral solution).
 The recommended initial dose of LYSODREN is 2 g to 6 g orally, in three or four divided doses per day.
 Increase doses incrementally to achieve a blood concentration of 14 to 20 mg / L, or as tolerated.
 The recommended dose of LYSTEDA for women with normal renal function is two 650 mg tablets taken three times daily (3900 mg / day) for a maximum of 5 days during monthly menstruation.
 Dosage adjustment is needed in patients with serum creatinine concentration higher than 1.4 mg / dL (Table 1).
 The dose for any age is 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously, preferably into the outer aspect of the upper arm.
 The recommended age for primary vaccination is 12 to 15 months.
 Children first vaccinated when younger than 12 months of age should receive another dose between 12 to 15 months of age followed by revaccination prior to elementary school entry.59 See also INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Measles Outbreak Schedule.

 Adults and Pediatric Patients Over 12 Years: One 100 mg capsule every 12 hours for seven days.
 5 - 7 mg / kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).
 For long - term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 - 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate.
 For long - term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg / kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.
 Macugen 0.3 mg should be administered once every six weeks by intravitreous injection into the eye to be treated.
 Intramuscular: Adults and older children: For severe hypomagnesemia, 1 to 5 g (2 to 10 mLof 50% solution) daily in divided doses; administration is repeated daily until serum levels have returned to normal.
 If deficiency is not severe, 1 g (2 mL of 50% solution) can be given once or twice daily.
 Intravenous: 1 to 4 g magnesium sulfate (magnesium sulfate (magnesium sulfate injection) injection) may be given intravenously in 10% to 20% solution, but only with great caution; the rate should not exceed 1.5 mL of 10% solution or equivalent per minute until relaxation is obtained.

 Subsequently, 1 g is given every 30 minutes until relief is obtained.
 The recommended dosage of MAGNEVIST Injection is 0.2 mL / kg (0.1 mmol / kg) administered intravenously, at a rate not to exceed 10 mL per 15 seconds.
 Adults: One MALARONE Tablet (adult strength = 250 mg atovaquone / 100 mg proguanil hydrochloride) per day.
 Table 1: Dosage for Prevention of Malaria in Pediatric Patients
 Adults: Four MALARONE Tablets (adult strength; total daily dose 1 g atovaquone / 400 mg proguanil hydrochloride) as a single daily dose for 3 consecutive days.
 Table 2: Dosage for Treatment of Acute Malaria in Pediatric Patients
 Do not use MALARONE for malaria prophylaxis in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min) [See CONTRAINDICATIONS].
 No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL / min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL / min) renal impairment.
 Dosage Adults:   The usual dosage range for cefamandol (cefamandole) e is 500 mg to 1 g every 4 to 8 hours.
 In infections of skin structures and in uncomplicated pneumonia, a dosage of 500 mg every 6 hours is adequate.
 In uncomplicated urinary tract infections, a dosage of 500 mg every 8 hours is sufficient.
 In more serious urinary tract infections, a dosage of 1 g every 8 hours may be needed.
 In life - threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, doses up to 2 g every 4 hours (ie, 12 g / day) may be needed.
 Infants and Children:   Administration of 50 to 100 mg / kg / day in equally divided doses every 4 to 8 hours has been effective for most infections susceptible to Mandol (cefamandole) .
 This may be increased to a total daily dose of 150 mg / kg (not to exceed the maximum adult dose) for severe infections.
 Adults  1 or 2 g intravenously or intramuscularly 1 / 2 to 1 hour prior to the surgical incision followed by 1 or 2 g every 6 hours for 24 to 48 hours.
 Pediatric Patients (3 months of age and older)  50 to 100 mg / kg / day in equally divided doses by the routes and schedule designated above.
 After an initial dose of 1 to 2 g (depending on the severity of infection), a maintenance dosage schedule should be followed (see chart).
 Males:          Weight (kg) x (140 - age)                    72 x serum creatinine
 Females:      0.9 x above value
 Intramuscular Administration  Each g of Mandol (cefamandole) should be diluted with 3 mL of 1 of the following diluents: Sterile Water for Injection, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection.
 In those with normal renal function, the intravenous dosage for such infections is 3 to 12 g of Mandol (cefamandole) daily.
 In conditions such as bacterial septicemia, 6 to 12 g / day may be given initially by the intravenous route for several days, and dosage may then be gradually reduced according to clinical response and laboratory findings.
 A SOLUTION OF 1 G OF MANDOL (cefamandole) IN 22 ML OF STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION IS ISOTONIC.
 For direct intermittent intravenous administration, each g of cefamandol (cefamandole) e should be reconstituted with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, 5% Dextrose Injection, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection.
 However, during infusion of the solution containing Mandol (cefamandole) , it is desirable to discontinue the other solution.
 If Sterile Water for Injection is used as the diluent, reconstitute with approximately 20 mL / g to avoid a hypotonic solution.
 For continuous intravenous infusion, each g of cefamandol (cefamandole) e should be diluted with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection.
 The usual adult dosage ranges from 50 to 200 g in a 24 - hour period, but in most instances an adequate response will be achieved at a dosage of approximately 100 g / 24 hours.
 The rate of administration is usually adjusted to maintain a urine flow of at least 30 to 50 mL / hr.
 In adults the dose is 0.2 g / kg body weight.
 In pediatric patients the dose is 0.2 g / kg body weight or 6 g / m² body surface area.
 The infusion is given as a 15% to 25% solution over a period of 3 to 5 minutes to produce a urine flow of at least 30 to 50 mL / hour.
 Prevention of Acute Renal Failure (Oliguria): When used during cardiovascular or other types of surgery, 50 to 100 g of mannitol (mannitol (mannitol injection) injection) as a 5%, 10%, or 15% solution may be given.
 Treatment of Oliguria: The usual dose to promote diuresis in oliguric patients: Adults, 300 to 400 mg / kg of body weight (21 to 28 g for a 70 kg patient) or up to 100 g of solution, given as a single dose (often in conjunction with furosemide); pediatric patients, 0.25 to 2 g / kg body weight or 60 g / m body surface area as a 15% to 20% solution over a period of 2 to 6 hours.
 Reduction of Intracranial Pressure and Brain Mass: In adults a dose of 0.25 to 2 g / kg body weight as a 15% to 25% solution administered over a period of 30 to 60 minutes; pediatric patients 1 to 2 g / kg body weight or 30 to 60 g / m² body surface area over a period of 30 to 60 minutes.
 In small or debilitated patients, a dose of 500 mg / kg may be sufficient.
 Reduction of Intraocular Pressure: In adults a dose of 0.25 to 2 g / kg body weight as a 15% to 25% solution administered over a period of 30 to 60 minutes; pediatric patients 1 to 2 g / kg body weight or 30 to 60 g / m² body surface area over a period of 30 to 60 minutes.
 In small or debilitated patients, a dose of 500 mg / kg may be sufficient.
 When used preoperatively, the dose should be given one to one and one - half hours before surgery to achieve maximal reduction of intraocular pressure before operation.
 Adjunctive Therapy for Intoxications: As an agent to promote urinary excretion of toxic substances: Adults may receive a 5% to 25% solution for as long as indicated if urinary output remains high; pediatric patients may receive 2 g / kg of body weight of a 5% or 10% solution.
 If benefits are not observed after 200 g of mannitol are administered, discontinue the mannitol (mannitol (mannitol injection) injection) therapy.
 Measurement of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): 100 mL of a 20% solution (20 g) should be diluted with 180 mL of sodium chloride injection (normal saline) or 200 mL of a 10% solution (20 g) should be diluted with 80 mL of sodium chloride injection (normal saline).
 The resulting 280 mL of 7.2% solution is infused at a rate of 20 mL per minute.
 Normal clearance rates are approximately 125 mL / minute for men; 116 mL / minute for women.
 The duration of anesthesia with MARCAINE is such that for most indications, a single dose is sufficient.
 Most experience to date is with single doses of MARCAINE up to 225 mg with epinephrine 1:200,000 and 175 mg without epinephrine; more or less drug may be used depending on individualization of each case.
 In clinical studies to date, total daily doses have been up to 400 mg. Until further experience is gained, this dose should not be exceeded in 24 hours.
 Use in Epidural Anesthesia: During epidural administration of MARCAINE, 0.5% and 0.75% solutions should be administered in incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL with sufficient time between doses to detect toxic manifestations of unintentional intravascular or intrathecal injection.
 In obstetrics, only the 0.5% and 0.25% concentrations should be used; incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL of the 0.5% solution not exceeding 50 mg to 100 mg at any dosing interval are recommended.
 Test Dose for Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Blocks: The Test Dose of MARCAINE (0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine in a 3 mL ampul) is recommended for use as a test dose when clinical conditions permit prior to caudal and lumbar epidural blocks.
 The average dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) per injection site will usually suffice; an occasional second dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) may be used if necessary to produce adequate anesthesia after making allowance for 2 to 10 minutes onset time.
 The lowest effective dose should be employed and time should be allowed between injections; it is recommended that the total dose for all injection sites, spread out over a single dental sitting, should not ordinarily exceed 90 mg for a healthy adult patient (ten 1.8 mL injections of 0.5% MARCAINE with epinephrine).
 Initially, 2.5 mg MARINOL Capsules should be administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.
 For patients unable to tolerate this 5 mg / day dosage of MARINOL Capsules, the dosage can be reduced to 2.5 mg / day, administered as a single dose in the evening or at bedtime.
 If clinically indicated and in the absence of significant adverse effects, the dosage may be gradually increased to a maximum of 20 mg / day MARINOL Capsules, administered in divided oral doses.
 MARINOL Capsules is best administered at an initial dose of 5 mg / m², given 1 to 3 hours prior to the administration of chemotherapy, then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy is given, for a total of 4 to 6 doses / day.
 Should the 5 mg / m² dose prove to be ineffective, and in the absence of significant side effects, the dose may be escalated by 2.5 mg / m² increments to a maximum of 15 mg / m² per dose.
 Dosage should be started with one tablet (10 mg) of Marplan twice daily.
 If tolerated, dosage may be increased by increments of one tablet (10 mg) every 2 to 4 days to achieve a dosage of four tablets daily (40 mg) by the end of the first week of treatment.
 Dosage can then be increased by increments of up to 20 mg / week, if needed and tolerated, to a maximum recommended dosage of 60 mg / day.
 Because of the limited experience with systematically monitored patients receiving Marplan at the higher end of the currently recommended dose range of up to 60 mg / day, caution is indicated in patients for whom a dose of 40 mg / day is exceeded (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).
 The recommended dose of Marqibo is 2.25 mg / m² intravenously over 1 hour once every 7 days.
 Marqibo takes approximately 60 to 90 minutes to prepare.
 The following doses are for administration of the drug as a single agent.
 When used in combination with other anticancer drugs, the Matulane dose should be appropriately reduced, eg, in the MOPP regimen, the Matulane dose is 100 mg / m² daily for 14 days.
 Matulane therapy, single or divided doses of 2 to 4 mg / kg / day for the first week are recommended.
 Daily dosage should then be maintained at 4 to 6 mg / kg / day until maximum response is obtained or until the white blood count falls below 4000 / cmm or the platelets fall below 100,000 / cmm.
 When maximum response is obtained, the dose may be maintained at 1 to 2 mg / kg / day.
 After toxic side effects have subsided, therapy may then be resumed at the discretion of the physician, based on clinical evaluation and appropriate laboratory studies, at a dosage of 1 to 2 mg / kg / day.
 Fifty (50) mg per square meter of body surface per day is recommended for the first week.
 Dosage should then be maintained at 100 mg per square meter of body surface per day until maximum response is obtained or until leukopenia or thrombocytopenia occurs.
 When maximum response is attained, the dose may be maintained at 50 mg per square meter of body surface per day.
 The recommended initial dosage of MAVIK for patients not receiving a diuretic is 1 mg once daily in non - black patients and 2 mg in black patients.
 Most patients have required dosages of 2 to 4 mg once daily.
 There is little clinical experience with doses above 8 mg.
 Patients inadequately treated with once - daily dosing at 4 mg may be treated with twice - daily dosing.
 If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 0.5 mg MAVIK should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours until blood pressure has stabilized.
 The recommended starting dose is 1 mg, once daily.
 Following the initial dose, all patients should be titrated (as tolerated) toward a target dose of 4 mg, once daily.
 If a 4 mg dose is not tolerated, patients can continue therapy with the greatest tolerated dose.
 For patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min.
 or with hepatic cirrhosis, the recommended starting dose, based on clinical and pharmacokinetic data, is 0.5 mg daily.
 The usual dose for adults and children 12 years and older is two inhalations (400 mcg) repeated every 4 - 6 hours.
 One inhalation (200 mcg) repeated every 4 - 6 hours may be sufficient for some patients.
 The recommended starting dose of MAXALT is either 5 mg or 10 mg for the acute treatment of migraines in adults.
 The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg in any 24 - hour period.
 The recommended dose of MAXALT is 5 mg in patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lb), and 10 mg in patients weighing 40 kg (88 lb) or more.
 The efficacy and safety of treatment with more than one dose of MAXALT within 24 hours in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age have not been established.
 In adult patients taking propranolol, only the 5 - mg dose of MAXALT is recommended, up to a maximum of 3 doses in any 24 - hour period (15 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 For pediatric patients weighing 40 kg (88 lb) or more, taking propranolol, only a single 5 - mg dose of MAXALT is recommended (maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24 - hour period).
 MAXALT should not be prescribed to propranolol - treated pediatric patients who weigh less than 40 kg (88 lb) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 No dosage adjustment is needed for elderly patients with normal renal function (ClCr ≥ 40 mL / min / 1.73 m²).
 In patients with a creatinine clearance > 10 mL / min / 1.73 m² but < 40 mL / min / 1.73 m², the recommended dosage is an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by daily maintenance doses of 200 mg (½ tablet) once daily for the duration of treatment.
 Hemodialysis patients should receive an initial loading dose of 400 mg followed by daily maintenance doses of 200 mg (½ tablet) once daily for the duration of treatment.
 The usual dose of MAXZIDE - 25 MG is one or two tablets daily, given as a single dose, with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see WARNINGS).
 The usual dose of MAXZIDE is one tablet daily, with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see WARNINGS).
 There is no experience with the use of more than one MAXZIDE tablet daily or more than two MAXZIDE - 25 MG tablets daily.
 Clinical experience with the administration of two MAXZIDE - 25 MG tablets daily in divided doses (rather than as a single dose) suggests an increased risk of electrolyte imbalance and renal dysfunction.
 Patients receiving 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide who become hypokalemic may be transferred to MAXZIDE (triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) directly.
 Patients receiving 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide who become hypokalemic may be transferred to MAXZIDE - 25 MG (37.5 mg triamterene / 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) directly.
 If an optimal blood pressure response is not obtained with MAXZIDE - 25 MG, the dose should be increased to two MAXZIDE - 25 MG tablets daily as a single dose, or one MAXZIDE tablet daily.
 Clinical studies have shown that patients taking less bioavailable formulations of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in daily doses of 25 mg to 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg to 100 mg triamterene may be safely changed to one MAXZIDE - 25 MG tablet daily.
 The dosage of MAXIPIME for hemodialysis patients is 1 g on Day 1 followed by 500 mg every 24 hours for the treatment of all infections except febrile neutropenia, which is 1 g every 24 hours.

 The dose range for adults is 20 to 40 mL; the usual dose is 20 mL; children require proportionately less.
 In addition to the warnings previously described, during aortography by the translumbar technique, extreme care is advised to avoid inadvertent intrathecal injection, since the injection of even small amounts (5 to 7 mL) of the contrast medium may cause convulsions, permanent sequelae, or fatality.
 A small dose of 1 to 2 mL should be administered to locate the exact site of the needle or catheter tip.
 For adults and children over 16 years of age, the usual dose is 15 to 40 mL as a single injection, repeated if indicated.
 Doses up to a total of 160 mL have been given safely.

 However, it is advisable to ensure that patients are well hydrated prior to examination.
 Depending on the area to be imaged, the usual dose range is 20 to 60 mL.
 Central catheter injections are usually made with a power injector with an injection rate of between 10 and 30 mL / second.
 Also, since contrast medium may remain in the arm vein for an extended period following injection, it may be advisable to flush the vein, immediately following injection with an appropriate volume (20 to 25 mL) of 5% Dextrose in water or normal saline.
 The recommended adult dose, after reconstitution with oxidant - free sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m, is 370 to 740 megabecquerels (10 to 20 millicuries [200 μCi / kg]) by slow intravenous injection over a period of 30 seconds.
 Optimum scanning time is 1 to 4 hours post - injection.
 The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average patient (70 kg) from an intravenous injection of a maximum dose of 740 megabecquerels (20 millicuries) of Technetium Tc 99m Medronate are shown in Table 4.

 In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (4 mg of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone).
 Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am.
 During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation.
 Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every six hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used.
 Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenal cortical suppression for two or more days.
 Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenal cortical suppression for 1¼ to 1&frac12 days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy.
 For the relief of acute pain in adults and adolescents ≥ 14 years of age, the recommended dose is 500 mg as an initial dose followed by 250 mg every 6 hours as needed, usually not to exceed one week.

 For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of METAGLIP (glipizide and metformin) is 2.5 mg / 500 mg or 5 mg / 500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals.
 The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg / 500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg / 2000 mg per day.
 Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to METAGLIP (glipizide and metformin) 2.5 mg / 500 mg or 5 mg / 500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken.
 The recommended dose of Metastron is 148 MBq, 4 mCi, administered by slow intravenous injection (1 - 2 minutes).
 Alternatively, a dose of 1.5 - 2.2 MBq / kg, 40 - 60 μCi / kg body weight may be used.
 The estimated radiation dose that would be delivered over time by the intravenous injection of 37 MBq, 1 mCi of Strontium - 89 to a normal healthy adult is given in Table 4.
 Measured values of the dose on the surface of the unshielded vial are about 65 mR / minute / mCi.
 Initiate treatment with methadone hydrochloride tablets with 2.5 mg orally every 8 to 12 hours.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to methadone hydrochloride tablets:
 Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid (in this case, Morphine Extended Release Tablets 50 mg twice daily)
 50 mg Morphine Extended Release Tablets 2 times daily = 100 mg total daily dose of Morphine
 100 mg total daily dose of Morphine x 15% (10% to 20% per Table 1) = 15 mg methadone hydrochloride daily
 15 mg daily / 2 = 7.5 mg methadone hydrochloride every 12 hours
 Then 7.5 mg is rounded down to 5 mg methadone hydrochloride every 12 hours
 Use a conversion ratio of 1:2 mg for parenteral to oral methadone (e.g., 5 mg parenteral methadone to 10 mg oral methadone).
 Do not abruptly discontinue methadone hydrochloride tablets.
 An initial single dose of 20 to 30 mg of methadone hydrochloride tablets will often be sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms.
 The initial dose should not exceed 30 mg.
 Provide an additional 5 to 10 mg of methadone hydrochloride tablets if withdrawal symptoms have not been suppressed or if symptoms reappear.
 The total daily dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets on the first day of treatment should not ordinarily exceed 40 mg.
 For a brief course of stabilization followed by a period of medically supervised withdrawal, titrate the patient to a total daily dose of about 40 mg in divided doses to achieve an adequate stabilizing level.
 Most commonly, clinical stability is achieved at doses between 80 to 120 mg / day.
 There is considerable variability in the appropriate rate of methadone taper in patients choosing medically supervised withdrawal from methadone treatment.
 Dose reductions should generally be less than 10% of the established tolerance or maintenance dose, and 10 to 14 - day intervals should elapse between dose reductions.
 Particular vigilance is necessary during treatment initiation, during conversion from one opioid to another, and during dose titration.
 While methadone's duration of analgesic action (typically 4 to 8 hours) in the setting of single - dose studies approximates that of morphine, methadone's plasma elimination half - life is substantially longer than that of morphine (typically 8 to 59 hours vs. 1 to 5 hours).
 It should be noted that many commonly cited equianalgesia tables only present relative analgesic potencies of single opioid doses in non - tolerant patients, thus greatly underestimating methadone's analgesic potency, and its potential for adverse effects in repeated - dose settings.
 When parenteral methadone is used as the first analgesic in patients who are not already being treated with, and tolerant to, opioids, the usual intravenous methadone starting dose is 2.5 mg to 10 mg every 8 to 12 hours, slowly titrated to effect.
 Conversion from oral methadone to parenteral methadone should initially use a 2:1 dose ratio (e.g., 10 mg oral methadone to 5 mg parenteral methadone).
 The third column assumes a 2:1 ratio for converting from oral to intravenous methadone.
 Particular vigilance is necessary during treatment initiation, during conversion from one opioid to another, and during dos e titration.
 While methadone's duration of analgesic action (typically 4 to 8 hours) in the setting of single - dose studies approximates that of morphine, methadone's plasma elimination half - life is substantially longer than that of morphine (typically 8 to 59 hours vs. 1 to 5 hours).
 Initially, a single dose of 20 to 30 mg of methadone will often be sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms.
 The initial dose should not exceed 30 mg.
 If same - day dosing adjustments are to be made, the patient should be asked to wait 2 to 4 hours for further evaluation, when peak levels have been reached.
 An additional 5 to 10 mg of methadone may be provided if withdrawal symptoms have not been suppressed or if symptoms reappear.
 The total daily dose of methadone on the first day of treatment should not ordinarily exceed 40 mg.
 For patients preferring a brief course of stabilization followed by a period of medically supervised withdrawal, it is generally recommended that the patient be titrated to a total daily dose of about 40 mg in divided doses to achieve an adequate stabilizing level.
 Most commonly, clinical stability is achieved at doses between 80 to 120 mg / day.
 There is considerable variability in the appropriate rate of methadone taper in patients choosing medically supervised withdrawal from methadone treatment.
 It is generally suggested that dose reductions should be less than 10% of the established tolerance or maintenance dose, and that 10 to 14 - day intervals should elapse between dose reductions.
 Initiate Methadose therapy with small doses, no more than 2.5 mg to 10 mg every 8 to 12 hours.
 Use a conversion ratio of 1:2 mg for parenteral to oral methadone (e.g., 5 mg parenteral methadone to 10 mg oral methadone).
 The dose conversion scheme below (Table 1) is derived from various consensus guidelines for converting chronic pain patients to methadone from morphine.
 Table 1 has been included in order to illustrate this concept and to provide a recommendation for a starting point for opioid conversion.
 An initial single dose of 20 to 30 mg of Methadose will often be sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms.
 The initial dose should not exceed 30 mg.
 Provide an additional 5 to 10 mg of Methadose if withdrawal symptoms have not been suppressed or if symptoms reappear.
 The total daily dose of Methadose on the first day of treatment should not ordinarily exceed 40 mg.
 For a brief course of stabilization followed by a period of medically supervised withdrawal, titrate the patient to a total daily dose of about 40 mg in divided doses to achieve an adequate stabilizing level.

 One tablet, 0.2 mg, 3 or 4 times daily in the puerperium for a maximum of 1 week.
 In the androgen - deficient male the guideline for replacement therapy indicates the usual initial dosage of 10 - 50 mg daily.
 Guideline dosages of androgens for use in the palliative treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer are 50 - 200 mg daily.
 Methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide tablet 5 mg) tablet 5 mg) tablet 5 mg) is administered orally.
 The usual adult dose ranges from 2.5 mg to 10 mg once daily.
 Maximum effective single dose is 10 mg; larger single doses do not accomplish greater diuresis, and are not recommended.
 The usual adult dose ranges from 2.5 to 5 mg once daily.
 If control of blood pressure is not satisfactory after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy with 5 mg once daily, another antihypertensive drug should be added.
 Increasing the dosage of methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide tablet 5 mg) tablet 5 mg) tablet 5 mg) will usually not result in further lowering of blood pressure.
 Methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide (methyclothiazide tablet 5 mg) tablet 5 mg) tablet 5 mg) may be either employed alone for mild to moderate hypertension or concurrently with other antihypertensive drugs in the management of more severe forms of hypertension.
 The usual starting dosage of methyldopa tablets is 250 mg two to three times a day in the first 48 hours.
 When methyldopa tablets are given with antihypertensives other than thiazides, the initial dosage of methyldopa tablets should be limited to 500 mg daily in divided doses; when methyldopa tablets are added to a thiazide, the dosage of thiazide need not be changed.
 The usual daily dosage of methyldopa tablets is 500 mg to 2 g in two to four doses.
 Although occasional patients have responded to higher doses, the maximum recommended daily dosage is 3 g. Once an effective dosage range is attained, a smooth blood pressure response occurs in most patients in 12 to 24 hours.
 A thiazide may be added at any time during methyldopa therapy and is recommended if therapy has not been started with a thiazide or if effective control of blood pressure cannot be maintained on 2 g of methyldopa daily.
 Initial dosage is based on 10 mg / kg of body weight daily in two to four doses.
 The maximum dosage is 65 mg / kg or 3 g daily, whichever is less.
 Methyldopate HCl (methyldopate hydrochloride injection, solution) Injection when given intravenously in effective doses, causes a decline in blood pressure that may begin in four to six hours and last 10 to 16 hours after injection.
 Add the desired dose of Methyldopate HCl (methyldopate hydrochloride injection, solution) Injection to 100 mL of Dextrose Injection 5%, USP.
 Alternatively the desired dose may be given in 5% dextrose in water in a concentration of 100 mg / 10 mL.
 Adults: The usual adult dosage intravenously is 250 mg to 500 mg at six hour intervals as required.
 The maximum recommended intravenous dose is 1 gram every six hours.
 A thiazide may be added at any time during methyldopa therapy and is recommended if therapy has not been started with a thiazide or if effective control of blood pressure cannot be maintained on 2 grams of methyldopa daily.
 Pediatric Patients: The recommended daily dosage is 20 to 40 mg / kg of body weight in divided doses every six hours.
 The maximum dosage is 65 mg / kg or 3 grams daily, whichever is less.
 0.1 to 0.2 mL per kilogram of body weight (0.045 to 0.09 mL per pound of body weight).
 Average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily.
 Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily.
 In others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate.
 Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.
 Chewable Tablets: Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly.
 Average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily.
 Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily.
 In others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate.
 Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.
 Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly.
 This test, usually given on an outpatient basis, determines plasma 11 - desoxycortisol and / or ACTH levels after a single dose of Metopirone (metyrapone) .
 The patient is given 30 mg / kg (maximum 3 g Metopirone (metyrapone) ) at midnight with yogurt or milk.
 The blood sample for the assay is taken early the following morning (7:30 - 8:00 a.m.).
 The patient is then given a prophylactic dose of 50 mg cortisone acetate.
 An intact ACTH reserve is generally indicated by an increase in plasma ACTH to at least 44 pmol / L (200 ng / L) or by an increase in 11 - desoxycortisol to over 0.2 µmol / L (70 µg / L).
 Day 2: ACTH test to determine the ability of adrenals to respond - Standard ACTH test such as infusion of 50 units ACTH over 8 hours and measurement of 24 - hour urinary steroids.
 Adults: 750 mg orally, every 4 hours for 6 doses.
 A single dose is approximately equivalent to 15 mg / kg.
 Children: 15 mg / kg orally every 4 hours for 6 doses.
 A minimal single dose of 250 mg is recommended.
 The normal 24 - hour urinary excretion of 17 - OHCS ranges from 3 to 12 mg.
 Following continuous intravenous infusion of 50 units ACTH over a period of 8 hours, 17 - OHCS excretion increases to 15 to 45 mg per 24 hours.
 The response to exogenous ACTH is usually normal, producing the expected rise of urinary steroids (17 - OHCS or 17 - KGS).
 These patients have an elevated excretion of urinary corticosteroids under basal conditions and will often, but not invariably, show a "supernormal" response to ACTH and also to Metopirone (metyrapone) , excreting more than 35 mg per 24 hours of either 17 - OHCS or 17 - KGS.
 If the tablet should break or crumble while handling, discard and remove a new tablet.
 Take 10 mg to 15 mg dose of METOZOLV ODT up to four times daily (e.g., at least 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime).
 If symptoms only occur intermittently or at specific times of the day, metoclopramide may be used in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the symptoms rather than continuous treatment.
 Take a 10 mg dose of METOZOLV ODT up to four times a day (e.g., at least 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime).
 Over the course of treatment, doses of Metrodin® (urofollitropin for injection) may range between 75 IU to 300 IU per day depending on the individual patient response.
 It is recommended that the initial dose of the first cycle be 75 IU of Metrodin® (urofollitropin for injection) per day, ADMINISTERED INTRAMUSCULARLY.
 The dose should not be increased more than twice in any cycle or by more than one ampule (75 IU) per adjustment.
 To complete follicular development and effect ovulation in the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG, 5,000 U to 10,000 U, should be given 1 day after the last dose of Metrodin® (urofollitropin for injection) .
 As in the initial cycle, 5,000 U to 10,000 U of hCG must be given 1 day after the last dose of Metrodin® (urofollitropin for injection) to complete follicular development and induce ovulation.
 For Assisted Reproductive Technologies, therapy with Metrodin® (urofollitropin for injection) should be initiated in the early follicular phase (cycle day 2 or 3) at a dose of 150 IU per day, until sufficient follicular development is attained.
 Dissolve the contents of one ampule of Metrodin® (urofollitropin for injection) in one to two mL of sterile saline and ADMINISTER INTRAMUSCULARLY immediately.
 The recommended dose is one applicator full of METROGEL - VAGINAL (approximately 5 grams containing approximately 37.5 mg of metronidazole) intravaginally once or twice a day for 5 days.
 The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg / kg every six hours.
 The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract and endocardium may require longer treatment.
 It is important that (1) administration of the initial preoperative dose be completed approximately one hour before surgery so that adequate drug levels are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial incision, and (2) Metronidazole Injection, USP RTU be administered, if necessary, at 6 - hour intervals to maintain effective drug levels.
 Not more than one gram (half tube) of Metvixia (methyl aminolevulinate cream) Cream should be applied per treatment session.
 The light dose to be used is 37 J / cm², and the lamp should be placed 50 to 80 mm from the skin.
 The area of skin that can be illuminated is 80 x 180 mm.
 One Metvixia (methyl aminolevulinate cream) - PDT session consists of:
 If necessary adjust the dose to 37 J / cm².
 The distance between the LED panel and the lesion surface should be 50 to 80 mm (2 to3.2 in).
 The usual recommended starting dose is 20 mg once a day given with the evening meal.
 The recommended dosing range of lovastatin is 10 - 80 mg / day in single or two divided doses; the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg / day.
 Patients requiring reductions in LDLC of 20% or more to achieve their goal (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE) should be started on 20 mg / day of MEVACOR.
 A starting dose of 10 mg of lovastatin may be considered for patients requiring smaller reductions.
 The 10 mg dosage is provided for information purposes only.
 Although lovastatin tablets 10 mg are available in the marketplace, MEVACOR is no longer marketed in the 10 mg strength.
 In patients taking danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil concomitantly with lovastatin, therapy should begin with 10 mg of lovastatin and should not exceed 20 mg / day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, WARNINGS, Myopathy / Rhabdomyolysis, PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS, Other Drug Interactions).
 In patients taking amiodarone concomitantly with MEVACOR, the dose should not exceed 40 mg / day (see WARNINGS, Myopathy / Rhabdomyolysis and PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS, Other Drug Interactions).
 The recommended dosing range of lovastatin is 10 - 40 mg / day; the maximum recommended dose is 40 mg / day.
 Patients requiring reductions in LDL - C of 20% or more to achieve their goal should be started on 20 mg / day of MEVACOR.
 A starting dose of 10 mg of lovastatin may be considered for patients requiring smaller reductions.
 In patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min), dosage increases above 20 mg / day should be carefully considered and, if deemed necessary, implemented cautiously (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS, Myopathy / Rhabdomyolysis).
 Initiate MEXITIL (mexiletine hcl) therapy with 200 mg every eight hours when rapid control of arrhythmia is not essential.
 Dose may be adjusted in 50 or 100 mg increments up or down.
 Satisfactory control can be achieved in most patients by 200 to 300 mg given every eight hours with food or antacid.
 If satisfactory response has not been achieved at 300 mg q8h, and the patient tolerates MEXITIL (mexiletine hcl) well, a dose of 400 mg q8h may be tried.
 As the severity of CNS side effects increases with total daily dose, the dose should not exceed 1200 mg / day.
 When rapid control of ventricular arrhythmia is essential, an initial loading dose of 400 mg of MEXITIL (mexiletine hcl) may be administered, followed by a 200 mg dose in eight hours.
 If adequate suppression is achieved on a MEXITIL (mexiletine hcl) dose of 300 mg or less every eight hours, the same total daily dose may be given in divided doses every 12 hours while carefully monitoring the degree of suppression of ventricular ectopy.
 This dose may be adjusted up to a maximum of 450 mg every 12 hours to achieve the desired response.
 The following dosage schedule, based on theoretical considerations rather than experimental data, is suggested for transferring patients from other Class I oral antiarrhythmic agents to MEXITIL (mexiletine hcl) : MEXITIL (mexiletine hcl) treatment may be initiated with a 200 mg dose, and titrated to response as described above, 6 - 12 hours after the last dose of quinidine sulfate, 3 - 6 hours after the last dose of procainamide, 6 - 12 hours after the last dose of disopyramide or 8 - 12 hours after the last dose of tocainide.
 The recommended dose of Miacalcin injection for treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease of bone is 100 International Units (0.5 mL) per day administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly.
 The recommended starting dose of Miacalcin injection for early treatment of hypercalcemia is 4 International Units / kg body weight every 12 hours by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.
 If the response to this dose is not satisfactory after one or two days, the dose may be increased to 8 International Units / kg every 12 hours.
 If the response remains unsatisfactory after two more days, the dose may be further increased to a maximum of 8 International Units / kg every 6 hours.
 The recommended dose of Miacalcin injection for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women greater than 5 years postmenopause is 100 International Units (0.5 mL) per day administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly.
 If the volume of Miacalcin injection to be injected exceeds 2 mL, intramuscular injection is preferable and the total dose should be distributed across multiple sites of injection.
 Patients who use Miacalcin injection for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis should receive adequate calcium (at least 1000 mg elemental calcium per day) and vitamin D (at least 400 International Units per day).
 The usual starting dose of MICARDIS tablets is 40 mg once a day.
 Blood pressure response is dose - related over the range of 20 to 80 mg [see Clinical Studies].
 When additional blood pressure reduction beyond that achieved with 80 mg MICARDIS is required, a diuretic may be added.
 The recommended dose of MICARDIS tablets is 80 mg once a day and can be administered with or without food.
 It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
 Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with telmisartan monotherapy 80 mg on MICARDIS HCT, 80 mg / 12.5 mg once daily.
 Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by 25 mg once daily of hydrochlorothiazide, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen on MICARDIS HCT 80 mg / 12.5 mg once daily.
 Initiate patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency under close medical supervision using the 40 mg / 12.5 mg combination.
 The usual dietary intake of potassium by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day.
 Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
 Doses of 40 to 100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion.
 Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.
 The usual dietary potassium intake by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day.
 Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
 Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day are given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.
 Usual Adult Dose: One Micro - K LS 20 mEq packet 1 to 5 times daily, depending on the requirements of the patient.
 Suspension in Liquids other than Water: Studies conducted using orange juice, tomato juice, apple juice and milk as the suspending liquid have shown that the quantity of fluid used to suspend one Micro - K LS packet MUST be limited to 2 fluid ounces (1 / 4 glassful).
 If a liquid other than water is used to suspend Micro - K LS, then the contents of the packet should be slowly poured into 2 fluid ounces (1 / 4 glassful) of liquid.
 The usual starting dose of MICRONASE Tablets is 2.5 to 5 mg daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal.
 Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1.25 mg daily.
 Transfer of patients from other oral antidiabetic regimens to MICRONASE should be done conservatively and the initial daily dose should be 2.5 to 5 mg.
 If the insulin dose is less than 20 units daily, substitution of MICRONASE Tablets 2.5 to 5 mg as a single daily dose may be tried.
 If the insulin dose is between 20 and 40 units daily, the patient may be placed directly on MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg daily as a single dose.
 If the insulin dose is more than 40 units daily, a transition period is required for conversion to MICRONASE.
 In these patients, insulin dosage is decreased by 50% and MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg daily is started.
 The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 1.25 to 20 mg daily, which may be given as a single dose or in divided doses (See Dosage Interval section).
 Dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 2.5 mg at weekly intervals based upon the patient's blood glucose response.
 Although patients may be transferred from the maximum dose of other sulfonylureas, the maximum starting dose of 5 mg of MICRONASE Tablets should be observed.
 A maintenance dose of 5 mg of MICRONASE Tablets provides approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 to 375 mg chlorpropamide, 250 to 375 mg tolazamide, 500 to 750 mg acetohexamide, or 1000 to 1500 mg tolbutamide.
 When transferring patients receiving more than 40 units of insulin daily, they may be started on a daily dose of MICRONASE Tablets 5 mg concomitantly with a 50% reduction in insulin dose.
 Progressive withdrawal of insulin and increase of MICRONASE in increments of 1.25 to 2.5 mg every 2 to 10 days is then carried out.
 Daily doses of more than 20 mg are not recommended.
 Some patients, particularly those receiving more than 10 mg daily, may have a more satisfactory response with twice - a - day dosage.
 For Control of Hypertension: The adult initial dose of MICROZIDE (hydrochlorothiazide capsule) is one capsule given once daily whether given alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.
 Total daily doses greater than 50 mg are not recommended.
 If it is necessary to use MIDAMOR (amiloride) alone (see INDICATIONS), the starting dosage should be one 5 mg tablet daily.
 This dosage may be increased to 10 mg per day, if necessary.
 More than two 5 mg tablets usually are not needed, and there is little controlled experience with such doses.
 If persistent hypokalemia is documented with 10 mg, the dose can be increased to 15 mg, then 20 mg, with careful monitoring of electrolytes.
 Midazolam HCI syrup is indicated for use as a single dose (0.25 to 1 mg / kg with a maximum dose of 20 mg) for preprocedural sedation and anxiolysis in pediatric patients.
 The 2.5 mL size container is not a unit dose.
 The recommended dose for pediatric patients is a single dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg / kg, depending on the status of the patient and desired effect, up to a maximum dose of 20 mg.
 The younger (6 months to <6 years of age) and less cooperative patients may require a higher than usual dose up to 1 mg / kg.
 A dose of 0.25 mg / kg may suffice for older (6 to <16 years of age) or cooperative patients, especially if the anticipated intensity and duration of sedation is less critical.
 For all pediatric patients, a dose of 0.25 mg / kg should be considered when midazolam HCI syrup is administered to patients with cardiac or respiratory compromise, other higher risk surgical patients, and patients who have received concomitant narcotics or other CNS depressants.
 *For 2.5 mL container, insert tip of oral dispenser directly into opening of the bottle.
 Clinical experience has shown midazolam to be 3 to 4 times as potent per mg as diazepam.
 Excessive single doses or rapid or intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and / or arrest.
 Midazolam, at a concentration of 0.5 mg / mL, is compatible with 5% dextrose in water and 0.9% sodium chloride for up to 24 hours and with lactated Ringer's solution for up to 4 hours.
 Both the 1 mg / mL and 5 mg / mL formulations of midazolam may be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.
 It should be noted that adequate time to achieve peak central nervous system effect (3 to 5 minutes) for midazolam should be allowed between doses to minimize the potential for oversedation.
 FOR RELIEF OF MIGRAINE HEADACHE: The usual adult dosage is two capsules at once, followed by one capsule every hour until relieved, up to 5 capsules within a twelve hour period.
 FOR RELIEF OF TENSION HEADACHE: The usual adult dosage is one or two capsules every four hours up to 8 capsules a day.
 Tell the patient to place two 200 mcg misoprostol tablets in each cheek pouch (the area between the cheek and gums) for 30 minutes and then swallow any remnants with water or another liquid (see Figure 1).
 Figure 1
 2 pills between cheek and gum on left side + 2 pills between cheek and gum on right side
 If complete expulsion has not occurred, but the pregnancy is not ongoing, women may be treated with another dose of misoprostol 800 mcg buccally.
 The solution used in Migranal (dihydroergotamine mesylate spray) ® (dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP) Nasal Spray (4 mg / mL) is intended for intranasal use and must not be injected.
 One spray (0.5 mg) of Migranal (dihydroergotamine mesylate spray) ® (dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP) Nasal Spray should be administered in each nostril.
 Fifteen minutes later, an additional one spray (0.5 mg) of Migranal (dihydroergotamine mesylate spray) ® (dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP) Nasal Spray should be administered in each nostril, for a total dosage of four sprays (2.0 mg) of Migranal® (dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP) Nasal Spray.
 Studies have shown no additional benefit from acute doses greater than 2.0 mg for a single migraine administration.
 The safety of doses greater than 3.0 mg in a 24 hour period and 4.0 mg in a 7 day period has not been established.
 Mimvey (estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets, USP) therapy consists of a single tablet to be taken once daily.

 Doses should be increased gradually from a starting dose of 0.375 mg / day given in three divided doses and should not be increased more frequently than every 5 to 7 days.
 MIRAPEX tablets were effective and well tolerated over a dosage range of 1.5 to 4.5 mg / day administered in equally divided doses three times per day with or without concomitant levodopa (approximately 800 mg / day).
 In a fixed - dose study in early Parkinson's disease patients, doses of 3 mg, 4.5 mg, and 6 mg per day of MIRAPEX tablets were not shown to provide any significant benefit beyond that achieved at a daily dose of 1.5 mg / day.
 The frequency of these events was generally 2 - fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg / day.
 The incidence of somnolence reported with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg / day was comparable to placebo.
 MIRAPEX tablets may be tapered off at a rate of 0.75 mg per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.75 mg.
 Thereafter, the dose may be reduced by 0.375 mg per day [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended starting dose of MIRAPEX tablets is 0.125 mg taken once daily 2 - 3 hours before bedtime.
 Although the dose of MIRAPEX tablets was increased to 0.75 mg in some patients during long - term open - label treatment, there is no evidence that the 0.75 mg dose provides additional benefit beyond the 0.5 mg dose.
 In clinical trials of patients being treated for RLS with doses up to 0.75 mg once daily, MIRAPEX tablets were discontinued without a taper.
 The starting dose is 0.375 mg given once per day.
 Based on efficacy and tolerability, dosages may be increased gradually, not more frequently than every 5 to 7 days, first to 0.75 mg per day and then by 0.75 mg increments up to a maximum recommended dose of 4.5 mg per day.
 In clinical trials, dosage was initiated at 0.375 mg / day and gradually titrated based on individual therapeutic response and tolerability.
 Doses greater than 4.5 mg / day have not been studied in clinical trials.
 MIRAPEX ER tablets may be tapered off at a rate of 0.75 mg per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.75 mg.
 Thereafter, the dose may be reduced by 0.375 mg per day.
 In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL / min), MIRAPEX ER tablets should initially be taken every other day.
 Caution should be exercised and careful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability should be made before increasing to daily dosing after one week, and before any additional titration in 0.375 mg increments up to 2.25 mg per day.
 The dose of Mircera, given as a single IV or SC injection, should be based on the total weekly ESA dose at the time of conversion.
 One white tablet is taken daily for 21 days, followed by 1 light - green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days and 1 yellow (active) tablet daily for 5 days.
 If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should keep taking 1 white tablet daily until the next Sunday.
 Counting the first day of menstruation as “Day 1”, tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one light - green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 yellow (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days.
 If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
 If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day.
 Mirena contains 52 mg of levonorgestrel (LNG).
 Initially, LNG is released at a rate of approximately 20 mcg / day.

 Treatment of Testicular Tumors:   In the treatment of patients with testicular tumors the recommended daily dose of Mithracin (plicamycin) is 25 to 30 mcg (0.025 - 0.030 mg) per kilogram of body weight.
 Individual daily doses should not exceed 30 mcg (0.030 mg) per kilogram of body weight.
 In hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria associated with advanced malignancy the recommended course of treatment with Mithracin (plicamycin) is 25 mcg (0.025 mg) per kilogram of body weight per day for 3 or 4 days.
 It may be possible to maintain normal calcium balance with single, weekly doses or with a schedule of 2 or 3 doses per week.
 For prophylaxis of gout flares, the recommended dosage of MITIGARE® is 0.6 mg once or twice daily.
 The maximum dose is 1.2 mg per day.
 Method of Reconstitution: Each vial of Mitosol® contains 0.2 mg of mitomycin and mannitol in a 1:2 concentration ratio.
 To reconstitute, add 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, then shake to dissolve.
 Keep the sponges on the treatment area for two (2) minutes, then remove and return to the Mitosol® Tray for defined disposal in the Chemotherapy Waste Bag provided.
 Lyophilized Mitosol® stored at controlled room temperature (i.e., 20 - 25°C or 68° - 77° F) is stable for the shelf life indicated on the package.
 Reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection at a concentration of 0.2 mg / ml, mitomycin is stable for one (1) hour at room temperature.
 Doses of 0.15 mg / kg administered over 5 to 15 seconds, 0.2 mg / kg administered over 30 seconds, or 0.25 mg / kg administered in divided doses (0.15 mg / kg followed in 30 seconds by 0.1 mg / kg) are recommended for facilitation of tracheal intubation for most patients (see Table 7).
 The purpose of slowed or divided dosing of MIVACRON at doses above 0.15 mg / kg is to minimize the transient decreases in blood pressure observed in some patients given these doses over 5 to 15 seconds (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).
 In patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease and in patients with any history suggesting a greater sensitivity to the release of histamine or other mediators (e.g., asthma), the dose of MIVACRON should be 0.15 mg / kg or less, administered over 60 seconds (see PRECAUTIONS).
 No data are available on the use of doses of MIVACRON above 0.15 mg / kg in patients with clinically significant kidney or liver disease.
 Clinically effective neuromuscular block may be expected to last for 15 to 20 minutes (range: 9 to 38 minutes) and spontaneous recovery may be expected to be 95% complete in 25 to 30 minutes (range: 16 to 41 minutes) following 0.15 mg / kg MIVACRON administered to patients receiving opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia.
 The expected duration of clinically effective block and time to 95% spontaneous recovery following 0.2 mg / kg MIVACRON are approximately 20 and 30 minutes, respectively, and following 0.25 mg / kg MIVACRON are approximately 25 and 35 minutes.
 Initiation of maintenance dosing during opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia is generally required approximately 15, 20 and 25 minutes following initial doses of 0.15 mg / kg, 0.2 mg / kg, and 0.25 mg / kg MIVACRON, respectively (see Table 1).
 Maintenance doses of 0.1 mg / kg each provide approximately 15 minutes of additional clinically effective block.
 Recommended initial doses of MIVACRON may be used to facilitate tracheal intubation prior to the administration of these agents; however, if MIVACRON is first administered after establishment of stable - state isoflurane or enflurane anesthesia (administered with nitrous oxide / oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC), the initial dose of MIVACRON may be reduced by as much as 25%.
 Upon early evidence of spontaneous recovery from an initial dose, an initial infusion rate of 9 to 10 mcg / kg / min is recommended.
 On average, an infusion rate of 5 to 7 mcg / kg / min (range: 1 to 15 mcg / kg / min) may be expected to maintain neuromuscular block within the range of 89% to 99% for extended periods in adults receiving opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia.
 Reduction of the infusion rate by up to 35% to 40% should be considered when MIVACRON is administered during stable - state conditions of isoflurane or enflurane anesthesia (administered with nitrous oxide / oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC).
 The recommended dose of MIVACRON for facilitating tracheal intubation in children 2 to 12 years of age is 0.2 mg / kg administered over 5 to 15 seconds.
 When administered during stable opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia, 0.2 mg / kg of MIVACRON produces maximum neuromuscular block in an average of 1.9 minutes (range: 1.3 to 3.3 minutes) and clinically effective block for 10 minutes (range: 6 to 15 minutes).
 Administration of doses of MIVACRON above the recommended range (greater than 0.2 mg / kg) is associated with transient decreases in MAP in some children (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Hemodynamics).
 During opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia, the infusion rate required to maintain 89% to 99% neuromuscular block averages 14 mcg / kg / min (range: 5 to 31 mcg / kg / min).
 Table 8 provides guidelines for delivery in mL / hr (equivalent to microdrops / min when 60 microdrops = 1 mL) of MIVACRON Injection (2 mg / mL).

 There was no additional benefit demonstrated by increasing the dose above 7.5 mg in clinical trials.
 In patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dosage of MOBIC is 7.5 mg per day [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The usual starting dosage is 1 tablet a day.
 The dosage may be increased to 2 tablets a day, if necessary.
 More than 2 tablets of MODURETIC (amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide) daily usually are not needed and there is no controlled experience with such doses.
 Hydrochlorothiazide can be given at doses of 12.5 to 50 mg per day when used alone.
 Patients usually do not require doses of hydrochlorothiazide in excess of 50 mg daily when combined with other antihypertensive agents.
 The daily dose is usually given as a single dose but may be given in divided doses.
 Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, Candida infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence.
 The activity per test is comparable to or greater than 5 tuberculin units (5 TU) administrated by the Mantoux method.
 The presence of palpable induration (even 1 to 2 mm) indicates a positive reaction.
 A multiple puncture test utilizing tuberculin dried on the tines may produce one, two, three or four separate reactions of varying size, or two or more reactions may coalesce.
 Required = Body weight (in kg) x desired Factor VIII increase (% normal)x 0.5
 CAUTION: This kit contains two devices, a stainless steel 5 micron filter needle, individually labeled as a 5 micron filter needle and contained in a separate blister pack, and an all plastic 5 micron vented filter spike which is supplied with the four - item administration components blister pack, either of which may be used to withdraw the reconstituted product for administration.
 Adults: The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg / day.
 The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours.
 In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.
 For pediatric patients above eight years of age: The recommended dosage schedule for pediatric patients weighing 100 pounds or less is 2 mg / lb of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by 1 mg / lb of body weight given as a single daily dose or divided into two doses, on subsequent days.
 Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men): 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days.
 As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.
 Acute epididy mo - orchitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae: 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.

 CHILDREN: weighing less than 100 pounds (45 kg); 1 mg / lb (2.2 mg / kg) of body weight, by mouth, twice a day for 60 days.
 The recommended regimen of Monoket® tablets, USP is 20 mg twice daily, with the doses seven hours apart.
 A starting dose of 5 mg (½ tablet of the 10 mg dosing strength) might be appropriate for persons of particularly small stature but should be increased to at least 10 mg by the second or third day of therapy.
 The asymmetric (2 doses, 7 hours apart) dosing regimen for Monoket® tablets provides a daily nitrate - free interval to minimize the development of tolerance.
 As also noted under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, well - controlled studies have shown that tolerance to Monoket® tablets occurs to some extent when using the twice - daily regimen in which the two doses are given seven hours apart.
 Doses above 20 mg twice a day (with the doses seven hours apart) have not been adequately studied.
 Doses of 5 mg twice a day are clearly effective (effectiveness based on exercise tolerance) for only the first day of a twice - a - day (with doses 7 hours apart) regimen.
 As a general rule, 1 IU of Factor IX activity per kg can be expected to increase the circulating level of Factor IX by 1% [IU / dL] of normal.
 Number of Factor IX required (IU) = Body Weight (in kg) x desired Factor IX increase (% or IU / dL normal) x 1.0 IU / kg IU [per IU / dL]

 Mononine® (coagulation factor ix (human)) administered in doses of ≥ 75 IU / kg were well tolerated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 When reconstituted as directed, i. e. , to approximately 100 IU / mL, Mononine® (coagulation factor ix (human)) should be administered at a rate of approximately 2.
 0 mL per minute.
 The recommended initial dose of MONOPRIL (fosinopril sodium tablets) is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic.
 The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 - 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg.
 If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of MONOPRIL (fosinopril sodium) should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized.
 In children, doses of MONOPRIL (fosinopril sodium) between 0.1 and 0.6 mg / kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects).
 MONOPRIL (fosinopril sodium) in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy.
 The usual starting dose of MONOPRIL (fosinopril sodium) should be 10 mg once daily.
 An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed.
 Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily.
 The usual effective dosage range is 20 to 40 mg once daily.
 For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment: In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function.
 Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances < 80 mL / min / 1.73 m2), including end - stage renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL / min / 1.73 m2).
 Fosinopril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 10 – 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 – 50 mg per day.
 In clinical trials of fosinopril / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using fosinopril doses of 2.5 – 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses at 5 – 37.5 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component.
 Dosage must be guided by clinical response; controlled clinical trials showed that the addition of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide to 10 – 20 mg of fosinopril will typically be associated with additional reduction in seated diastolic blood pressure at 24 hours after dosing.
 On average, the effect of the combination of 10 mg of fosinopril with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was similar to the effect seen with monotherapy using either 40 mg of fosinopril or 37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.
 In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance is < 30 mL / min / 1.73 m², serum creatine roughly ≥ 3 mg / dL or 265 μmol / L), loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so MONOPRIL - HCT is not recommended.
 The device is administered by a single injection via the para - patellar approach under sterile conditions.

 To determine possible sensitivity to the drug, some clinicians recommend injection of 0.25 to 1 mL of 5% Morrhuate Sodium Injection into a varicosity 24 hours before administration of a large dose.
 The usual adult dose for obliteration of small or medium veins is 50 to 100 mg (1 to 2 mL of the 5% injection).
 For large veins, 150 to 250 mg (3 to 5 mL of the injection) is used.
 The drug may be given as multiple injections at one time or in single doses.
 The recommended starting dose of MOTOFEN® tablets in adults is 2 tablets then 1 tablet after each loose stool or 1 tablet every 3 to 4 hours as needed, but the total dosage during any 24 - hour treatment period should not exceed 8 tablets.
 The recommended MOVANTIK dosage is 25 mg once daily in the morning.
 If patients are not able to tolerate MOVANTIK, reduce the dosage to 12.5 mg once daily [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The starting dosage for patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 60 mL / min (i.e., patients with moderate, severe or end - stage renal impairment) is 12.5 mg once daily.
 If this dosage is well tolerated but OIC symptoms continue, the dosage may be increased to 25 mg once daily taking into consideration the potential for markedly increased exposures in some patients with renal impairment and the increased risk of adverse reactions with higher exposures [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 If concurrent use is unavoidable, reduce the MOVANTIK dosage to 12.5 mg once daily and monitor for adverse reactions [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 There are two possible dosing regimens.
 Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids, as follows:
 Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows:
 The recommended dose of MOXATAG is 775 mg once daily taken within 1 hour of finishing a meal for 10 days.
 Do not chew or crush tablet.
 Instill 1 drop in the affected eye(s) 2 times daily for 7 days.
 Each vial delivers 1.2 mL of 20 mg / mL solution, and the volume to be administered to patients should be calculated from the following equation:
 Based on increasing exposure with increasing body weight, the Mozobil dose should not exceed 40 mg / day.
 In patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (CLCR) ≤ 50 mL / min), reduce the dose of Mozobil by one - third based on body weight category as shown in Table 1.
 If CLCR is ≤ 50 mL / min the dose should not exceed 27 mg / day, as the mg / kg - based dosage results in increased plerixafor exposure with increasing body weight.
 Initiate treatment with MS CONTIN with 15 mg tablets orally every 8 or 12 hours.
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is MS CONTIN 15 mg orally every 12 hours.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Discontinue all other around - the - clock opioid drugs when MS CONTIN therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using MS CONTIN 15 mg orally every 8 to 12 hours.
 Parenteral to oral morphine ratio: Between 2 to 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine.
 Because steady - state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, MS CONTIN dosage adjustments may be done every 1 to 2 days.
 Gently pour 5 mL of MuGard into the mouth and rinse the entire oral cavity for a minute or longer if possible.
 If necessary, up to 10 mL may be used to fully coat the inside of the mouth.

 Retreatment: In patients who have received previous antituberculous therapy, administer MYAMBUTOL 25 mg / kg (11 mg / lb) of body weight, as a single oral dose once every 24 hours.
 After 60 days of MYAMBUTOL administration, decrease the dose to 15 mg / kg (7mg / lb) of body weight, and administer as a single oral dose once every 24 hours.
 During the period when a patient is on a daily dose of 25 mg / kg, monthly eye examinations are advised.
 See Table for easy selection of proper weight - dose tablet(s).
 Average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily.
 Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily.
 In others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate.
 Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.
 Chewable Tablets: Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly.
 The recommended dose is one troche five times a day for fourteen consecutive days.
 For prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients immunocompromised by conditions that include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or steroid therapy utilized in the treatment of leukemia, solid tumors, or renal transplantation, the recommended dose is one troche three times daily for the duration of chemotherapy or until steroids are reduced to maintenance levels.
 It is recommended that MYCOBUTIN Capsules be administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily.

 Dosing on a weight basis is the same for both pediatric patients and adults, approximately 60 mcg / kg of body weight or 1.8 mg / m of body surface, daily.
 Since the rate of fall of the leukocyte count is dose related, daily doses exceeding 4 mg per day should be reserved for patients with the most compelling symptoms; the greater the total daily dose, the greater is the possibility of inducing bone marrow aplasia.
 When remission is shorter than 3 months, maintenance therapy of 1 to 3 mg daily may be advisable in order to keep the hematological status under control and prevent rapid relapse.
 The recommended dose of Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin for injection) is 9 mg / m² , infused over a 2 - hour period.
 Patients should receive the following prophylactic medications one hour before Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin for injection) administration: diphenhydramine 50 mg po and acetaminophen 650 - 1000 mg po; thereafter, two additional doses of acetaminophen 650 - 1000 mg po, one every 4 hours as needed.
 Reconstitute the contents of each vial with 5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, using sterile syringes.
 The final concentration of the reconstituted drug solution is 1 mg / mL.
 Prepare an admixture corresponding to 9 mg / m² dose of Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin for injection) by injecting the reconstituted solution into a 100 mL 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution in either a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or ethylene / polypropylene copolymer (non - PVC) IV bag covered by an ultraviolet (UV) light protector.

 1st injection............................................................. 10 mg
 2nd injection........................................................... 25 mg
 3rd and subsequent injections, 25 to 50 mg until there is toxicity or major clinical improvement, or, in the absence of either of these, the cumulative dose of Gold Sodium Thiomalate reaches one gram.
 Gold Sodium Thiomalate is continued until the cumulative dose reaches one gram unless toxicity or major clinical improvement occurs.
 If significant clinical improvement occurs before a cumulative dose of one gram has been administered, the dose may be decreased or the interval between injections increased as with maintenance therapy.
 Maintenance doses of 25 to 50 mg every other week for two to 20 weeks are recommended.
 If the clinical course remains stable, injections of 25 to 50 mg may be given every third and subsequently every fourth week indefinitely.
 Should a patient fail to improve during initial therapy (cumulative dose of one gram), several options are available.
 After the initial test dose of 10 mg, the recommended dose for children is one mg per kilogram body weight, not to exceed 50 mg for a single injection.

 Table 1: Recommended Infusion Volumes and Rates
 The recommended starting dose of MYRBETRIQ® is 25 mg once daily with or without food.
 MYRBETRIQ® 25 mg is effective within 8 weeks.
 Based on individual patient efficacy and tolerability the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies].
 The daily dose of MYRBETRIQ® should not exceed 25 mg once daily in the following populations:
 Patients 8 years of age and older who have received no previous treatment may be started on Mysoline according to the following regimen using either 50 mg or scored 250 mg Mysoline tablets:
 Days 1 to 3: 100 to 125 mg at bedtime.
 Days 4 to 6: 100 to 125 mg b.i.d.
 Days 7 to 9: 100 to 125 mg t.i.d.
 Day 10 to maintenance: 250 mg t.i.d.
 For most adults and children 8 years of age and over, the usual maintenance dosage is three to four 250 mg Mysoline tablets in divided doses (250 mg t.i.d.
 If required, an increase to five or six 250 mg tablets daily may be made but daily doses should not exceed 500 mg q.i.d.
 The clinically effective serum level for primidone is between 5 to 12 μg / mL.
 Mysoline should be started at 100 to 125 mg at bedtime and gradually increased to maintenance level as the other drug is gradually decreased.
 Days 1 to 3: 50 mg at bedtime.
 Days 4 to 6: 50 mg b.i.d.
 Days 7 to 9: 100 mg b.i.d.
 Day 10 to maintenance: 125 mg t.i.d.
 to 250 mg t.i.d.
 For children under 8 years of age, the usual maintenance dosage is 125 to 250 mg three times daily or, 10 to 25 mg / kg / day in divided doses.
 Since the point of maximum therapeutic effectiveness with optimal muscle strength and no gastrointestinal disturbances is a highly critical one, the close supervision of a physician familiar with the disease is necessary.
 For the patient with moderately severe myasthenia, from 5 mg to 25 mg of MYTELASE (ambenoium chloride) three or four times daily is an effective dose.
 In some patients a 5 mg dose is effective, whereas other patients require as much as from 50 mg to 75 mg per dose.
 The physician should start with a 5 mg dose, carefully observing the effect of the drug on the patient.
 The longer duration of action of MYTELASE (ambenoium chloride) makes it desirable to adjust dosage at intervals of one to two days to avoid drug accumulation and overdosage.
 A few patients have required greater doses for adequate control of myasthenic symptoms, but increasing the dosage above 200 mg daily requires exacting supervision of a physician well aware of the signs and treatment of overdosage with cholinergic medication.
 Two mg edrophonium are administered intravenously one hour after the last anticholinesterase dose.
 A transient increase in strength occurring about 30 seconds later and lasting 3 to 5 minutes indicates insufficient maintenance dose.
 It is important to use a separate vial, sterile syringe, and needle for each individual patient, in order to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one person to another.

 Total daily dosage should not exceed 3,200 mg.
 A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients.
 The placebo - controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride tablets as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride tablets 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.
 Naltrexone hydrochloride tablets should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment of alcoholism.
 Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride tablets.
 If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter.
 A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids.
 Inject 0.2 mg naloxone.
 If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone.
 Administer 0.8 mg naloxone.
 In some cases, 0.1 mg IV naloxone has produced a diagnostic response.
 Thus, patients may receive 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride tablets every weekday with a 100 mg dose on Saturday, 100 mg every other day, or 150 mg every third day.
 There may be a higher risk of hepatocellular injury with single doses above 50 mg, and use of higher doses and extended dosing intervals should balance the possible risks against the probable benefits (see WARNINGS).
 Naltrexone hydrochloride tablets should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment.

 Patients already taking naproxen 250 mg, 375 mg, or 500 mg twice daily (morning and evening) may have their total daily dose replaced with NAPRELAN Tablets as a single daily dose.
 In patients who tolerate lower doses of NAPRELAN Tablets well, the dose may be increased to two NAPRELAN 750 mg tablets (1500 mg), or three NAPRELAN 500 mg tablets (1500 mg) once daily for limited periods when a higher level of anti - inflammatory / analgesic activity is required.
 The recommended starting dose is two NAPRELAN 500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily.
 For patients requiring greater analgesic benefit, two NAPRELAN 750 mg tablets (1500 mg) or three NAPRELAN 500 mg tablets (1500 mg) may be used for a limited period.
 Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed two NAPRELAN 500 mg tablets (1000 mg).
 The recommended dose on the first day is two to three NAPRELAN 500 mg tablets (1000 - 1500 mg) once daily, followed by two NAPRELAN 500 mg tablets (1000 mg) once daily, until the attack has subsided.
 In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg / day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti - inflammatory / analgesic activity is required.
 When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg / day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk.
 In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg / kg / day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg / kg given in 2 divided doses.

 This dose will generally be the dose that maintains total serum calcium (albumin - corrected) within the lower half of the normal range (i.e., between 8 and 9 mg / dL) without the need for active forms of vitamin D and with calcium supplementation sufficient and individualized to meet the patient's daily requirements.
 The dose of NATPARA may be increased in increments of 25 mcg every four weeks up to a maximum daily dose of 100 mcg if serum calcium cannot be maintained above 8 mg / dL without an active form of vitamin D and / or oral calcium supplementation.
 The dose of NATPARA may be decreased to as low as 25 mcg per day if total serum calcium is repeatedly above 9 mg / dL after the active form of vitamin D has been discontinued and calcium supplement has been decreased to a dose sufficient to meet daily requirements.
 The maintenance dose should be the lowest dose that achieves a total serum calcium (albumin - corrected) within the lower half of the normal total serum calcium range (i.e., approximately 8 and 9 mg / dL), without the need for active forms of vitamin D and with calcium supplementation sufficient to meet daily requirements.
 The recommended dose of NATRECOR® is an IV bolus of 2 mcg / kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.01 mcg / kg / min.
 The loading dose may not be appropriate for those with low systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 110 mm Hg or for patients recently treated with afterload reducers.

 If indicated, a subsequent increase to 15 mg / day total daily dose is often effective.
 In more severe conditions, an initial dose of 5 mg twice daily is recommended.
 The usual optimal dose is 20 to 30 mg daily.
 If indicated, an increase to 60 mg / day total daily dose is often effective.
 Exceeding a total daily dose of 60 mg rarely increases the beneficial response.

 For use as an adjunct in the management of hepatic coma, the recommended dose is 4 - 12 grams per day given in the following regimen:
 A drop of a suitable topical anesthetic may be applied, followed in a few minutes by 1 drop of the NEO - SYNEPHRINE (phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) hydrochloride 10 percent ophthalmic solutions on the upper limbus.
 To free recently formed posterior synechiae, 1 drop of the 10 percent ophthalmic solutions may be applied to the upper surface of the cornea.
 In the interim, hot compresses should be applied for five or ten minutes three times a day, with 1 drop of a 1 or 2 percent solution of atropine sulfate before and after each series of compresses.
 In certain patients with glaucoma, temporary reduction of intraocular tension may be attained by producing vasoconstriction of the intraocular vessels; this may be accomplished by placing 1 drop of the 10 percent ophthalmic solutions on the upper surface of the cornea.
 When a short - acting mydriatic is needed for wide dilatation of the pupil before intraocular surgery, the 10 percent ophthalmic solutions or 2.5 percent ophthalmic solution may be applied topically from 30 to 60 minutes before the operation.
 For adults, a drop of the preferred cycloplegic is placed in each eye, followed in five minutes by 1 drop of NEO - SYNEPHRINE (phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) hydrochloride 2.5 percent ophthalmic solution and in ten minutes by another drop of the cycloplegic.
 In 50 to 60 minutes, the eyes are ready for refraction.

 In one to two hours, the eyes are ready for refraction.
 One drop of NEO - SYNEPHRINE (phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) hydrochloride 2.5 percent ophthalmic solution is placed in each eye.
 Dilatation lasts from one to three hours.
 A 3 to 5 mm of mercury rise in pressure suggests the presence of angle block in patients with glaucoma; however, failure to obtain such a rise does not preclude the presence of glaucoma from other causes.
 Blanching Test: One or 2 drops of the 2.5 percent ophthalmic solution should be applied to the injected eye.
 Instill one or two drops of Ophthalmic Solution NEODECADRON (neomycin and dexamethasone) into the conjunctival sac every hour during the day and every two hours during the night as initial therapy.

 The daily dose of Neoral® should always be given in two divided doses (BID).
 The mean ± SD initial doses were 9 ± 3 mg / kg / day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8 ± 4 mg / kg / day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7 ± 3 mg / kg / day for heart transplant patients (24 centers).
 A representative dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2.0 mg / kg / day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg / kg / day by 1 week, 0.6 mg / kg / day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg / kg / day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg / kg / day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose.
 In transplanted patients who are considered for conversion to Neoral® from Sandimmune®, Neoral® should be started with the same daily dose as was previously used with Sandimmune® (1:1 dose conversion).
 Particular caution should be exercised when converting patients to Neoral® at doses greater than 10 mg / kg / day.
 In this population the cyclosporine blood trough concentration should be measured more frequently, at least twice a week (daily, if initial dose exceeds 10 mg / kg / day) until the concentration stabilizes within the desired range.
 The initial dose of Neoral® is 2.5 mg / kg / day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose.
 If insufficient clinical benefit is seen and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 - 0.75 mg / kg / day after 8 weeks and again after 12 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg / kg / day.
 Most patients can be treated with Neoral® doses of 3 mg / kg / day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg / week.
 The initial dose of Neoral® should be 2.5 mg / kg / day.
 Neoral® should be taken twice daily, as a divided (1.25 mg / kg BID) oral dose.
 Based on patient response, dose increases of approximately 0.5 mg / kg / day should be made to a maximum of 4.0 mg / kg / day.
 Doses below 2.5 mg / kg / day may also be equally effective.
 There were 9 cases of pustular and 4 cases of erythrodermic psoriasis.
 Applied Pharmacokinetics, Principles of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (1992) contains a broad discussion of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics and drug monitoring techniques.
 Symptomatic control of myasthenia gravis: One mL of the 1:2000 solution (0.5 mg) subcutaneously or intramuscularly.
 Subsequent doses should be based on the individual patient's response.In most patients, however, oral treatment with Neostigmine Bromide tablets, 15 mg each, is adequate for control of symptoms.
 Prevention of postoperative distention and urinary retention: 0.25 mg subcutaneously or intramuscularly as soon as possible after operation;repeat every 4 to 6 hours for two or three days.
 Treatment of postoperative distention: One mL of the 1:2000 solution (0.5 mg) subcutaneously or intramuscularly, as required.
 Treatment of urinary retention: One mL of the 1:2000 solution (0.5 mg) subcutaneously or intramuscularly.
 If urination does not occur within an hour, the patient should be catheterized.After the patient has voided, or the bladder has been emptied, continue the 0.5 mg injections every three hours for at least 5 injections.
 Reversal of Effects of Non - depolarizing Blocking Agents: When Neostigmine Methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate injection) injection) Injection, USP is administered intravenously, it is recommended that Atropine Sulfate (0.6 to 1.2 mg) also be given intravenously using separate syringes.Some authorities have recommended that the Atropine be injected several minutes before the Neostigmine rather than concomitantly.
 The usual dose is 0.5 to 2 mg Neostigmine Methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate injection) injection) Injection, USP given by slow intravenous injection, repeated as required.Only in exceptional cases should the total dose of Neostigmine Methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate injection) injection) exceed 5 mg.It is recommended that the patient be well ventilated and a patent airway maintained until complete recovery of normal respiration is assured.The optimum time for administration of the drug is during hyperventilation when the carbon dioxide level of the blood is low.
 It should never be administered in the presence of high concentrations of halothane or cyclopropane.In cardiac cases and severely ill patients, it is advisable to titrate the exact dose of Neostigmine Methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate (neostigmine methylsulfate injection) injection) required, using a peripheral nerve stimulator device.In the presence of bradycardia, the pulse rate should be increased to about 80 / minute with Atropine before administering Neostigmine.

 For an administered activity of 150 MBq (4.05 mCi) the typical radiation dose to the critical organs, which are the urinary bladder wall, the spleen and the kidneys / adrenals, are about 18, 16 and 12 mGy, respectively.
 Because the spleen has one of the highest physiological uptakes, higher uptake and radiation dose to other organs or pathologic tissues may occur in patients with splenectomy.
 Physical data Gamma constant: 0.67 mrem / hr per mCi at 1 meter [1.8E - 4 mSv / hr per MBq at 1 meter]

 The recommended dosage of Neulasta is a single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg administered once per chemotherapy cycle.
 The recommended dose of Neulasta is two doses, 6 mg each, administered subcutaneously one week apart.
 Administer the first dose as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation levels greater than 2 gray (Gy).
 Neulasta is administered subcutaneously via a single prefilled syringe for manual use or for use with the On - body Injector for Neulasta which is co - packaged with a single prefilled syringe.
 The Neulasta prefilled syringe is not designed to allow for direct administration of doses less than 0.6 mL (6 mg).
 The syringe does not bear graduation marks which are necessary to accurately measure doses of Neulasta less than 0.6 mL (6 mg) for direct administration to patients.
 Thus, the direct administration to patients requiring dosing of less than 0.6 mL (6 mg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors.
 If the patient misses a dose, a new dose should be administered by single prefilled syringe for manual use, as soon as possible after detection.
 The recommended dose of Neumega in adults without severe renal impairment is 50 mcg / kg given once daily.
 Neumega should be administered subcutaneously as a single injection in either the abdomen, thigh, or hip (or upper arm if not self - injecting).
 The recommended dose of Neumega in adults with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min) is 25 mcg / kg.
 The recommended starting dosage of NEUPOGEN is 5 mcg / kg / day‚ administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection‚ by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes)‚ or by continuous intravenous infusion.
 Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg / kg for each chemotherapy cycle‚ according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir.
 The recommended dosage of NEUPOGEN following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg / kg / day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours.
 The recommended dosage of NEUPOGEN for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg / kg / day given by subcutaneous injection.
 The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg / kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg / kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection.
 In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of NEUPOGEN were: 6 mcg / kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg / kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg / kg (idiopathic neutropenia).
 In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of NEUPOGEN greater than or equal to 100 mcg / kg / day.
 The recommended dose of NEUPOGEN is 10 mcg / kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation.
 Administer NEUPOGEN as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation doses greater than 2 gray (Gy).
 If required for intravenous administration‚ NEUPOGEN (vial only) may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP from a concentration of 300 mcg / mL to 5 mcg / mL (do not dilute to a final concentration less than 5 mcg / mL).
 NEUPOGEN diluted to concentrations from 5 mcg / mL to 15 mcg / mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg / mL.
 The prescribed dose may be achieved using single or multiple patches.
 The lowest effective dose was 4 mg / 24 hours.
 The highest recommended dose for early - stage Parkinson's disease is 6 mg / 24 hours.
 The recommended dose for advanced - stage Parkinson's disease is 8 mg / 24 hours.
 The lowest effective dose was 1 mg / 24 hours.
 The highest recommended dose is 3 mg / 24 hours.
 The recommended dose of Neuraceq is 300 MBq (8.1 mCi), maximum 30 mcg mass dose, administered as a single slow intravenous bolus (6 sec / mL) in a total volume of up to 10 mL.
 Acquire PET images over 15 to 20 minutes starting 45 to 130 minutes after Neuraceq injection.
 Reconstruction should include attenuation correction with resulting transaxial pixel sizes between 2 and 3 mm.
 The effective dose resulting from a 300 MBq (8.1 mCi) administration of Neuraceq in adult subjects is 5.8 mSv.
 In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, NEURONTIN may be initiated on Day 1 as a single 300 mg dose, on Day 2 as 600 mg / day (300 mg two times a day), and on Day 3 as 900 mg / day (300 mg three times a day).
 The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a dose of 1800 mg / day (600 mg three times a day).
 In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg / day to 3600 mg / day with comparable effects across the dose range; however, in these clinical studies, the additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg / day was not demonstrated.
 The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day.
 The recommended maintenance dose of NEURONTIN is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day.
 Dosages up to 2400 mg / day have been well tolerated in long - term clinical studies.
 Doses of 3600 mg / day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated.
 Administer NEURONTIN three times a day using 300 mg or 400 mg capsules, or 600 mg or 800 mg tablets.
 The starting dose range is 10 mg / kg / day to 15 mg / kg / day, given in three divided doses, and the recommended maintenance dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days.
 The recommended maintenance dose of NEURONTIN in patients 3 to 4 years of age is 40 mg / kg / day, given in three divided doses.
 The recommended maintenance dose of NEURONTIN in patients 5 to 11 years of age is 25 mg / kg / day to 35 mg / kg / day, given in three divided doses.
 Dosages up to 50 mg / kg / day have been well tolerated in a long - term clinical study.
 Inform patients that, should they divide the scored 600 mg or 800 mg NEURONTIN tablet in order to administer a half - tablet, they should take the unused half - tablet as the next dose.
 If the NEURONTIN dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week (a longer period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber).
 Neutrexin (trimetrexate glucuronate for injection) is administered at a dose of 45 mg / m2 once daily by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes.
 Leucovorin may be administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg / m2 over 5 to 10 minutes every 6 hours for a total daily dose of 80 mg / m2, or orally as 4 doses of 20 mg / m2 spaced equally throughout the day.
 The oral dose should be rounded up to the next higher 25 mg increment.
 The recommended course of therapy is 21 days of Neutrexin (trimetrexate glucuronate inj) and 24 days of leucovorin.
 If leucovorin is given orally, doses should be rounded up to the next higher 25 mg increment.
 Renal toxicity: Interruption of Neutrexin (trimetrexate glucuronate inj) is advisable if serum creatinine levels increase to > 2.5 mg / dL and the elevation is considered to be secondary to Neutrexin (trimetrexate glucuronate inj) .
 Each vial of Neutrexin (trimetrexate glucuronate for injection) should be reconstituted in accordance with labeled instructions with either 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to yield a concentration of 12.5 mg of trimetrexate per mL (complete dissolution should occur within 30 seconds).
 After reconstitution, the solution should be used immediately; however, the solution is stable for 6 hours at room temperature (20 to 25ºC), or 24 hours under refrigeration (2 - 8°C).
 Prior to administration, the reconstituted solution should be further diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, to yield a final concentration of 0.25 to 2 mg of trimetrexate per mL.
 The intravenous line must be flushed thoroughly with at least 10 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, before and after administering Neutrexin (trimetrexate glucuronate inj) .
 In either case, the intravenous line must be flushed thoroughly with at least 10 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.
 Leucovorin calcium for injection should be diluted according to the instructions in the leucovorin package insert, and administered over 5 to 10 minutes every 6 hours.
 Intravenous lines should be flushed with at least 10 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, between Neutrexin (trimetrexate glucuronate inj) and leucovorin infusions.
 One drop of NEVANAC should be applied to the affected eye three - times - daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery and through the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period.

 The recommended daily dose of NEXAVAR is 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) taken twice daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal).
 When dose reduction is necessary, the NEXAVAR dose may be reduced to 400 mg once daily.
 If additional dose reduction is required, NEXAVAR may be reduced to a single 400 mg dose every other day [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 For patients with severe liver impairment (Child Pugh Class C), a dose of 20 mg of NEXIUM should not be exceeded [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Alternatively, for patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, one tablespoon of applesauce can be added to an empty bowl and the NEXIUM Delayed - Release Capsule can be opened, and the granules inside the capsule carefully emptied onto the applesauce.
 For patients who have a nasogastric tube in place, NEXIUM Delayed - Release Capsules can be opened and the intact granules emptied into a 60 mL catheter tipped syringe and mixed with 50 mL of water.
 The recommended adult dose is either 20 mg or 40 mg NEXIUM given once daily by intravenous injection (no less than 3 minutes) or intravenous infusion (10 minutes to 30 minutes).
 For patients with severe liver impairment (Child Pugh Class C), a maximum dose of 20 mg once daily of NEXIUM should not be exceeded [see Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended doses for children ages 1 month to 17 years, inclusive, are provided below.
 1 year to 17 years:
 1 month to less than 1 year of age: 0.5 mg / kg
 Adult dose is 80 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 8 mg / h for a total treatment duration of 72 hours (i.e., includes initial 30 - minute dose plus 71.5 hours of continuous infusion).
 For patients with liver impairment, no dosage adjustment of the initial esomeprazole 80 mg infusion is necessary.
 Preparation Instructions for Adult Patients Intravenous Injection (20 mg or 40 mg vial) over no less than 3 minutes
 The freeze - dried powder should be reconstituted with 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 Withdraw 5 mL of the reconstituted solution and administer as an intravenous injection over no less than 3 minutes.
 Preparation Instructions for Pediatric Patients Intravenous Infusion (20 mg or 40 mg) over 10 minutes to 30 minutes
 A solution for intravenous infusion is prepared by first reconstituting the contents of one vial* with 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and further diluting the resulting solution to a final volume of 50 mL.
 The resultant concentration after diluting to a final volume of 50 mL is 0.8 mg / mL (for 40 mg vial) and 0.4 mg / mL (for 20 mg vial).
 *For patients 1 month to less than 1 year of age, first calculate the dose (0.5 mg / kg) to determine the vial size needed.
 Preparation Instructions for Loading dose (80 mg) to be given over 30 minutes
 The loading dose of 80 mg is prepared by reconstituting two 40 mg vials.
 Reconstitute each 40 mg vial with 5 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 The contents of the two vials should be further diluted in 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for intravenous use.
 The continuous infusion is prepared by using two 40 mg vials.
 Reconstitute each 40 mg vial with 5 mL each of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 The contents of the two vials should be further diluted in 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for intravenous use.

 Confirm that the entire implant, which is 4 cm long, has been removed by measuring its length.
 Ultrasound scanning (USS) with a high - frequency linear array transducer (10 MHz or greater) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used.
 If the same incision is being used to insert a new implant, anesthetize the insertion site [for example, 2 mL lidocaine (1%)] applying it just under the skin along the 'insertion canal.'
 Take one levonorgestrel tablet orally as soon as possible within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure.
 The recommended starting dose of NEXTERONE is about 1000 mg over the first 24 hours of therapy, delivered by the following infusion regimen:
 Table 1: NEXTERONE PREMIXED INJECTION DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS: FIRST 24 HOURS
 After the first 24 hours, continue the maintenance infusion rate of 0.5 mg / min (720 mg per 24 hours) by directly infusing NEXTERONE Premixed Injection (360 mg / 200 mL; 1.8 mg / mL) at a rate of 0.278 mL / min.
 In the event of breakthrough episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, use 150 mg supplemental infusions of NEXTERONE (infused over 10 minutes to minimize the potential for hypotension).
 The first 24 - hour dose may be individualized for each patient; however, in controlled clinical trials, mean daily doses above 2100 mg were associated with an increased risk of hypotension.
 Intravenous amiodarone concentrations greater than 3 mg / mL have been associated with a high incidence of peripheral vein phlebitis; however, concentrations of 2.5 mg / mL or less appear to be less irritating.
 Therefore, for infusions longer than 1 hour, do not exceed NEXTERONE concentrations of 2 mg / mL, unless a central venous catheter is used [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The usual adult dosage of nicotinic acid is 1 to 2 grams two or three times a day.
 Start with one - half tablet (250 mg) as a single daily dose following the evening meal.
 The frequency of dosing and total daily dose can be increased every four to seven days until the desired LDL cholesterol and / or triglyceride level is achieved or the first - level therapeutic dose of 1.5 to 2 grams / day is reached.
 If the patient's hyperlipidemia is not adequately controlled after 2 months at this level, the dosage can then be increased at two to four week intervals to 3 grams / day (1 gram three times per day).
 In patients with marked lipid abnormalities, a higher dose is occasionally required, but generally should not exceed 6 grams / day.
 Therapy with NIASPAN must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy.
 The daily dosage of NIASPAN should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4 - week period.
 The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime.
 Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended.
 Single - dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable.
 Flushing of the skin [see ADVERSE REACTIONS] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg taken 30 minutes prior to NIASPAN dose).
 The recommended duration of treatment is 3 months, after which patients may be weaned from the NICOTROL (nicotine inhalation system) Inhaler by gradual reduction of the daily dose over the following 6 to 12 weeks.
 If a patient is unable to stop smoking by the fourth week of therapy, treatment should probably be discontinued.
 Each actuation of NICOTROL NS (nicotine nasal spray) delivers a metered 50 microliter spray containing 0.5 mg of nicotine.
 One dose is 1 mg of nicotine (2 sprays, one in each nostril).
 Patients should be started with 1 or 2 doses per hour, which may be increased up to a maximum recommended dose of 40 mg (80 sprays, somewhat less than 1 / 2 bottle) per day.
 For best results, patients should be encouraged to use at least the recommended minimum of 8 doses per day, as less is unlikely to be effective.
 In clinical trials, the patients who successfully quit smoking used the product heavily when nicotine withdrawal was at its peak, sometimes up to the recommended maximum of 40 doses per day ( in heavier smokers).
 Table 4
 Recommended strategies for discontinuation of use include suggesting that patients: use only 1 / 2 a dose (1 spray) at a time, use the spray less frequently, keep a tally of daily usage, try to meet a steadily reducing usage target, skip a dose by not medicating every hour, or set a planned “quit date” for stopping use of the spray.
 If a patient is unable to stop smoking by the fourth week of therapy, treatment should probably be discontinued.
 Directions: Adults take 1 or 2 capsules daily, or as directed by a physician.
 Usual adult dose is 1 capsule daily, or as directed by a physician..
 Adults: 1 or 2 capsules twice daily.
 Children age 6 and older: 1 capsule daily.
 12 years and over: 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls daily
 6 to 12 years: 1 teaspoonful daily
 Usual adult dose is 1 tablet daily, or as directed by a physician.
 The recommended dosage is 300 mg once a day for 30 days, followed thereafter by 150 mg once a day.
 One of two intubating doses of NIMBEX may be chosen, based on the desired time to tracheal intubation and the anticipated length of surgery.
 Doses of 0.15 (3 × ED95) and 0.20 (4 × ED95) mg / kg NIMBEX, as components of a propofol / nitrous oxide / oxygen inductionintubation technique, may produce generally GOOD or EXCELLENT conditions for intubation in 2.0 and 1.5 minutes, respectively.
 In two intubation studies using thiopental or propofol and midazolam and fentanyl as co - induction agents, EXCELLENT intubation conditions were most frequently achieved with the 0.2 mg / kg compared to 0.15 mg / kg dose of cisatracurium.
 The clinically effective durations of action for 0.15 and 0.20 mg / kg NIMBEX during propofol anesthesia are 55 minutes (range: 44 to 74 minutes) and 61 minutes (range: 41 to 81 minutes), respectively.
 A dose of 0.03 mg / kg NIMBEX is recommended for maintenance of neuromuscular block during prolonged surgical procedures.
 Maintenance doses of 0.03 mg / kg each sustain neuromuscular block for approximately 20 minutes.
 Maintenance dosing is generally required 40 to 50 minutes following an initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg NIMBEX and 50 to 60 minutes following an initial dose of 0.20 mg / kg NIMBEX, but the need for maintenance doses should be determined by clinical criteria.
 Isoflurane or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide / oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration) may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses.
 The recommended dose of NIMBEX for children 2 to 12 years of age is 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg administered over 5 to 10 seconds during either halothane or opioid anesthesia.
 When administered during stable opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia, 0.10 mg / kg NIMBEX produces maximum neuromuscular block in an average of 2.8 minutes (range: 1.8 to 6.7 minutes) and clinically effective block for 28 minutes (range: 21 to 38 minutes).
 When administered during stable opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia, 0.15 mg / kg NIMBEX produces maximum neuromuscular block in about 3.0 minutes (range: 1.5 to 8.0 minutes) and clinically effective block (time to 25% recovery) for 36 minutes (range: 29 to 46 minutes).
 The recommended dose of NIMBEX for intubation of infants 1 month to 23 months is 0.15 mg / kg administered over 5 to 10 seconds during either halothane or opioid anesthesia.
 When administered during stable opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia, 0.15 mg / kg NIMBEX produces maximum neuromuscular block in about 2.0 minutes (range: 1.3 to 3.4 minutes) and clinically effective block (time to 25% recovery) for about 43 minutes (range: 34 to 58 minutes).
 After administration of an initial bolus dose of NIMBEX, a diluted solution of NIMBEX can be administered by continuous infusion to adults and children aged 2 or more years for maintenance of neuromuscular block during extended surgical procedures.
 Thereafter, a rate of 1 to 2 mcg / kg / min should be adequate to maintain continuous neuromuscular block in the range of 89% to 99% in most pediatric and adult patients under opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia.
 The rate of infusion of atracurium required to maintain adequate surgical relaxation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery with induced hypothermia (25° to 28°C) is approximately half the rate required during normothermia.
 Spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block following discontinuation of infusion of NIMBEX may be expected to proceed at a rate comparable to that following administration of a single bolus dose.
 An infusion rate of approximately 3 mcg / kg / min (range: 0.5 to 10.2 mcg / kg / min) should provide adequate neuromuscular block in adult patients in the ICU.
 Tables 10 and 11 provide guidelines for delivery, in mL / hr (equivalent to microdrops / minute when 60 microdrops = 1 mL), of NIMBEX solutions in concentrations of 0.1 mg / mL (10 mg / 100 mL) or 0.4 mg / mL (40 mg / 100 mL).

 NIMBEX Injection is acidic (pH = 3.25 to 3.65) and may not be compatible with alkaline solution having a pH greater than 8.5 (e.g., barbiturate solutions).
 NIMBEX Injection diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to 0.1 mg / mL may be stored either under refrigeration or at room temperature for 24 hours without significant loss of potency.
 Dilutions to 0.1 mg / mL or 0.2 mg / mL in 5% Dextrose and Lactated Ringer's Injection may be stored under refrigeration for 24 hours.
 Nimotop (nimodipine) is given orally in the form of ivory colored, soft gelatin 30 mg capsules for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 The oral dose is 60 mg (two 30 mg capsules) every 4 hours for 21 consecutive days, preferably not less than one hour before or two hours after meals.
 The contents should then be emptied into the patient's in situnaso - gastric tube and washed down the tube with 30 mL of normal saline (0.9%).
 Dosage should be reduced to 30 mg every 4 hours, with close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate.
 The recommended starting dose of NINLARO is 4 mg administered orally once a week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 - day treatment cycle.
 The recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg administered daily on Days 1 through 21 of a 28 - day treatment cycle.
 The recommended starting dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28 - day treatment cycle.
 Reduce the starting dose of NINLARO to 3 mg in patients with moderate (total bilirubin greater than 1.5 - 3 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin greater than 3 x ULN) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Reduce the starting dose of NINLARO to 3 mg in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min) or end - stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.
 It is recommended that patients receive hydration with 500 to 1,000 mL of 5% Dextrose in 0.5 Normal Saline or equivalent before NIPENT administration.
 An additional 500 mL of 5% Dextrose or equivalent should be administered after NIPENT is given.
 The recommended dosage of NIPENT for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia is 4 mg / m² every other week.
 Although not established as required, the administration of two additional doses has been recommended following the achievement of a complete response.
 At any time thereafter that a complete response is achieved, two additional doses of NIPENT are recommended.
 Two patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearances 50 to 60 mL / min) achieved complete response without unusual adverse events when treated with 2 mg / m².
 NIPENT should be temporarily withheld if the absolute neutrophil count falls during treatment below 200 cells / mm³ in a patient who had an initial neutrophil count greater than 500 cells / mm³ and may be resumed when the count returns to predose levels.
 NIPENT vials are stable at refrigerated storage temperature 2° to 8° C (36° to 46°F) for the period stated on the package.
 In anuric patients, limit the mean infusion rate to 1 mcg / kg / min.
 While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some who require doses greater than 4 mg per day.
 Initiate treatment with a dose of 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily.
 The dose may be increased to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect, at intervals of 3 to 4 days, to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses.
 Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days.
 The successful treatment of many panic disorder patients has required the use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg daily.
 In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of alprazolam in panic disorder, doses in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily were used.
 The mean dosage employed was approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily.
 Among the approximately 1700 patients participating in the panic disorder development program, about 300 received alprazolam in dosages of greater than 7 mg per day, including approximately 100 patients who received maximum dosages of greater than 9 mg per day.
 Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg a day to achieve a successful response.
 Initiate treatment with a dose of 0.5 mg three times daily.
 Depending on the response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day.
 Slower titration to the dose levels greater than 4 mg per day may be advisable to allow full expression of the pharmacodynamic effect of NIRAVAM.
 For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodically reassess treatment and consider a reduction of dosage.
 In a controlled postmarketing dose - response study, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total daily maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit.
 Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days.
 Reduce the dose by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days.
 In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease, or in patients with debilitating disease (e.g., severe pulmonary disease), the usual starting dose is 0.25 mg, given two or three times daily.
 The suggested starting dose is between 0.2 mg / hr* and 0.4 mg / hr*.
 Doses between 0.4 mg / hr* and 0.8 mg / hr* have shown continued effectiveness for 10 to 12 hours daily for at least 1 month (the longest period studied) of intermittent administration.
 In these terms, the supplied NITRO - DUR systems would be rated at 2.5 mg / 24 hours (0.1 mg / hour), 5 mg / 24 hours (0.2 mg / hour), 7.5 mg / 24 hours (0.3 mg / hour), 10 mg / 24 hours (0.4 mg / hour), and 15 mg / 24 hours (0.6 mg / hour).
 Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue.
 Nitrolingual Pumpspray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.
 Each metered spray of Nitrolingual Pumpspray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays.
 If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re - primed with one spray.
 There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle.
 The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming.
 At the onset of an attack, one metered spray or two metered sprays should be administered on or under the tongue.
 If two sprays are used initially, the patient may only administer one more spray after waiting 5 minutes.
 NitroMist may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes before engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.
 After an initial priming of 10 sprays, each metered spray of NitroMist delivers 33 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin.
 NitroMist is available in either 230 metered sprays or 90 metered sprays per container, but the total number of available doses depends on the number of sprays per use (1 spray or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming.
 Depending on the desired concentration, the solution containing 50 mg of NITROPRESS must be further diluted in 250 - 1000 mL of sterile 5% dextrose injection.
 Infusion of sodium nitroprusside should therefore be started at a very low rate (0.3 mcg / kg / min), with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum recommended infusion rate (10 mcg / kg / min) has been reached.
 Table 2 below shows the infusion rates corresponding to the recommended initial and maximal doses (0.3 mcg / kg / min and 10 mcg / kg / min, respectively) for both adult and pediatric patients of various weights.
 Table 2: Infusion Rates (mL / hour) to Achieve Initial (0.3 mcg / kg / min) and Maximal (10 mcg / kg / min) Dosing of NITROPRESS
 As described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY above, when more than 500 mcg / kg of sodium nitroprusside is administered faster than 2 mcg / kg / min, cyanide is generated faster than the unaided patient can eliminate it.
 Rare patients receiving more than 10 mg / kg of sodium nitroprusside will develop methemoglobinemia; other patients, especially those with impaired renal function, will predictably develop thiocyanate toxicity after prolonged, rapid infusions.
 One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack.
 If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15 - minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, prompt medical attention is recommended.
 NITROSTAT may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.
 The usual duration of therapy for systemic infection is 6 months.
 The recommended starting dose of NIZORAL® (ketoconazole) Tablets is a single daily administration of 200 mg (one tablet).
 If clinical responsiveness is insufficient within the expected time, the dose of NIZORAL® Tablets may be increased to 400 mg (two tablets) once daily.
 In small numbers of children over 2 years of age, a single daily dose of 3.3 to 6.6 mg / kg has been used.
 One application of the shampoo should be sufficient.
 The usual hypnotic dose is 500 mg to 1 g, taken 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime or ½ hour before surgery.
 The usual sedative dose is 250 mg three times daily after meals.
 Generally, single doses or daily dosage should not exceed 2 g.
 The usual daily hypnotic dose is 50 mg / kg of body weight, with a maximum of 1 g per single dose.
 For patients with breast cancer, the recommended daily dose is 20 - 40 mg.
 Dosages greater than 20 mg per day should be given in divided doses (morning and evening).
 In three single agent adjuvant studies in women, one 10 mg NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate) tablet was administered two (ECOG and NATO) or three (Toronto) times a day for two years.
 In the NSABP B - 14 adjuvant study in women with node - negative breast cancer, one 10 mg NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate) tablet was given twice a day for at least 5 years.
 There was no indication that doses greater than 20 mg per day were more effective.
 The recommended dose is NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate) 20 mg daily for 5 years.
 The recommended dose is NOLVADEX (tamoxifen citrate) 20 mg daily for 5 years.
 One tablet is taken every day, at the same time.
 The usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain.
 The total daily dosage should not exceed 8 tablets.
 The usual adult dosage is one tablet every four to six hours as needed for pain.
 The total daily dosage should not exceed 6 tablets.
 The dosage of Nordette® - 28 is one light - orange tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one pink inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to prescribed schedule.
 One light - orange tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one pink inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself by using another method of birth control until she has taken a light - orange tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 When the patient is switching from a 28 - day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Nordette® - 28 on the day after her last tablet.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken before the medication is resumed.
 Any time the patient misses two or more light - orange tablets, she should also use another method of contraception until she has taken a light - orange tablet daily for seven consecutive days.
 If the patient misses one or more pink tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking light - orange tablets again on the proper day.
 While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two light - orange tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled light - orange tablets are missed.
 A dosage of 0.024 to 0.034 mg / kg / day, 6 to 7 times a week, is recommended.
 A dosage of up to 0.066 mg / kg / day is recommended.
 A dosage of up to 0.067 mg / kg / day is recommended.
 A dosage of up to 0.067 mg / kg / day is recommended.
 Recent literature has recommended initial treatment with larger doses of somatropin (e.g., 0.067 mg / kg / day), especially in very short children (i.e., HSDS < - 3), and / or older / pubertal children, and that a reduction in dosage (e.g., gradually towards 0.033 mg / kg / day) should be considered if substantial catch - up growth is observed during the first few years of therapy.
 On the other hand, in younger SGA children (e.g., approximately < 4 years) (who respond the best in general) with less severe short stature (i.e., baseline HSDS values between - 2 and - 3), consideration should be given to initiating treatment at a lower dose (e.g., 0.033 mg / kg / day), and titrating the dose as needed over time.
 Non - weight based — based on published consensus guidelines, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg / day (range, 0.15 - 0.30 mg / day) may be used without consideration of body weight.
 Weight - based — based on the dosing regimen used in the original adult GHD registration trials, the recommended dosage at the start of treatment is not more than 0.004 mg / kg / day.
 The dose may be increased to not more than 0.016 mg / kg / day after approximately 6 weeks according to individual patient requirements.
 INJECTION: Adults - One 2 mL ampul (60 mg) intravenously or intramuscularly; may be repeated every 12 hours.
 Norgesic (orphenadrine citrate with aspirin and caffeine) : Adults 1 to 2 tablets 3 to 4 times daily.
 Norgesic (orphenadrine citrate with aspirin and caffeine) Forte: Adults ½ to 1 tablet 3 to 4 times daily.
 For dilution, one 240 mL vial of NORMOCARB HF™ should be added to 3 Liters of Sterile Water for Injection to make 3.24 Liters of infusate solution.
 When administered post - filter, the replacement rate should not be greater than one third of the blood flow rate; e.g., for blood flow of 100 mL per min, equivalent to 6000 mL per hour, post - filter replacement rate should not exceed 2000 mL per hour.
 It may be stored at normal room temperature or refrigerated (2° to 30°C).
 Calcium: Calcium chloride up to 1.25 mMol per Liter (2.5 mEq per Liter) may be added to the diluted solution.
 Glucose: Up to 12 mL of D50W may be added to the diluted solution to provide a concentration of up to 10.2 mMol per Liter of dextrose.
 Phosphate: Potassium phosphate up to 1.2 mMol per Liter (2.4 mEq per Liter) may be added to the diluted solution.
 The total potassium concentration should not exceed 4 mEq per Liter.
 In patients with a creatinine clearance rate of 30 mL / min / 1.73 m² or less, the recommended dosage is one 400 - mg tablet once daily for the duration given above.
 Elderly patients being treated for urinary tract infections who have a creatinine clearance of 30 mL / min / 1.73 m² or less should receive 400 mg once daily as recommended under Renal Impairment.
 The usual adult dosage of Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) or Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) CR is 400 to 800 mg per day given in divided doses.
 The recommended dosage for most adults is 600 mg / day given in divided doses (either 150 mg every 6 hours for immediate - release Nor - pace or 300 mg every 12 hours for Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) CR).
 For patients whose body weight is less than 110 pounds (50 kg), the recommended dosage is 400 mg / day given in divided doses (either 100 mg every 6 hours for immediate - release Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) or 200 mg every 12 hours for Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) CR).
 A reduction of the dose by one third, from the recommended 600 mg / day to 400 mg / day, would be reasonable, without changing the dosing interval.
 For patients with cardiomyopathy or possible cardiac decompensation, a loading dose, as discussed below, should not be given, and initial dosage should be limited to 100 mg of immediate - release Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) every 6 to 8 hours.
 For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (cre - atinine clearance greater than 40 ml / min) or hepat - ic insufficiency, the recommended dosage is 400 mg / day given in divided doses (either 100 mg every 6 hours for immediate - release Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) or 200 mg every 12 hours for Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) CR).
 For patients with severe renal insufficiency (Ccr 40 ml / min or less), the recommended dosage regimen of immediate - release Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) is 100 mg at intervals shown in the table below, with or without an initial loading dose of 150 mg.
 For patients in whom rapid control of ventricular arrhythmia is essential, an initial loading dose of 300 mg of immediate - release Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) (200 mg for patients whose body weight is less than 110 pounds) is recommended, followed by the appropriate maintenance dosage.
 If there is no response or evidence of toxicity within 6 hours of the loading dose, 200 mg of immediate - release Nor - pace every 6 hours may be prescribed instead of the usual 150 mg.
 If there is no response to this dosage within 48 hours, either Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) should then be discontinued or the physician should consider hospitalizing the patient for careful monitoring while subsequent immediate - release Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) doses of 250 mg or 300 mg every 6 hours are given.
 A limited number of patients with severe refractory ventricular tachycardia have tolerated daily doses of Norpace (disopyramide phosphate) up to 1600 mg per day (400 mg every 6 hours), resulting in disopyramide plasma levels up to 9 mcg / ml.
 The NORPLANT (levonorgestrel implants (unavailable in us)) SYSTEM consists of six Silastic® capsules, each containing 36 mg of the progestin, levonorgestrel.
 The total administered (implanted) dose is 216 mg. Implantation of all six capsules should be performed during the first 7 days of the onset of menses by a health - care professional instructed in the NORPLANT (levonorgestrel implants (unavailable in us)) SYSTEM insertion technique.
 The usual adult dose is 100 to 200 mg per day.
 In more severely ill patients, dosage may be further increased gradually to 300 mg / day if necessary.
 Dosages above 300 mg / day are not recommended.
 Treatment of patients requiring as much as 300 mg should generally be initiated in hospitals, where regular visits by the physician, skilled nursing care, and frequent electrocardiograms (ECGs) are available.
 Initial therapy may be administered in divided doses or a single daily dose.
 The usual adolescent and geriatric dose is 25 to 100 mg daily.
 Dosage should be initiated at a lower level and increased according to tolerance and clinical response to a usual maximum of 100 mg daily.
 In more severely ill patients, dosage may be further increased to 150 mg / day.
 Doses above 150 mg / day are not recommended in these age groups.
 Initial therapy may be administered in divided doses or a single daily dose.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with NORPRAMIN is unclear.
 The recommended starting dose of NORTHERA is 100 mg, taken orally three times daily: upon arising in the morning, at midday, and in the late afternoon at least 3 hours prior to bedtime (to reduce the potential for supine hypertension during sleep).
 Titrate to symptomatic response, in increments of 100 mg three times daily every 24 to 48 hours up to a maximum dose of 600 mg three times daily (i.e., a maximum total daily dose of 1,800 mg).
  - 25 mg three or four times daily; dosage should begin at a low level and be increased as required.
 When doses above 100 mg daily are administered, plasma levels of nortriptyline should be monitored and maintained in the optimum range of 50 to 150 ng / mL.
 Doses above 150 mg / day are not recommended.
  - 30 to 50 mg / day, in divided doses, or the total daily dosage may be given once a day.
 Usual Adult Dose - - 25 mg 3 or 4 times daily; dosage should begin at a low level and be increased as required.
 When doses above 100 mg daily are administered, plasma levels of nortriptyline should be monitored and maintained in the optimum range of 50 to 150 ng / mL.
 Doses above 150 mg per day are not recommended.
 Elderly Patients - - 30 to 50 mg / day in divided doses.
 Plasma Levels - - Optimal responses to nortriptyline have been associated with plasma concentrations of 50 to 150 ng / mL.
 In one case, such a condition was associated with apparent cardiotoxicity despite the fact that nortriptyline concentrations were within the “therapeutic range.” Clinical findings should predominate over plasma concentrations as primary determinants of dosage changes.
 The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of NORVASC is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.
 Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding NORVASC to other antihypertensive therapy.
 The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 – 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.
 Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.
 The recommended dose range for patients with coronary artery disease is 5 – 10 mg once daily.
 In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies].
 The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6 – 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily.
 Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies].
 Patients who take the 600 mg twice daily soft gel capsule NORVIR dose may experience more gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea when switching from the soft gel capsule to the tablet formulation because of greater maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) achieved with the tablet formulation relative to the soft gel capsule [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dosage of ritonavir is 600 mg twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals.
 Ritonavir should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily.
 The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration.
 The recommended dosage of ritonavir in children greater than 1 month is 350 to 400 mg per m² twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily.
 Ritonavir should be started at 250 mg per m² twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m² twice daily.
 If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m² twice daily due to adverse events, the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents, however, alternative therapy should be considered.
 NORVIR oral solution contains 43.2% (v / v) alcohol and 26.57% (w / v) propylene glycol.
 The recommended dosage of ritonavir is 600 mg twice daily by mouth.
 Ritonavir should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily.
 The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration.
 The recommended dosage of ritonavir in children greater than 1 month is 350 to 400 mg per m² twice daily by mouth and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily.
 Ritonavir should be started at 250 mg per m² twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m² twice daily.
 If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m² twice daily due to adverse events, the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents, however, alternative therapy should be considered.
 The recommended dosage of NOVANTRONE is 12 mg / m² given as a short (approximately 5 to 15 minutes) intravenous infusion every 3 months.
 In addition, LVEF evaluations are recommended if signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure develop at any time during treatment with NOVANTRONE NOVANTRONE should not be administered to multiple sclerosis patients with an LVEF < 50%, with a clinically significant reduction in LVEF, or to those who have received a cumulative lifetime dose of ≥ 140 mg / m².
 Based on data from two Phase 3 comparative trials of NOVANTRONE plus corticosteroids versus corticosteroids alone, the recommended dosage of NOVANTRONE is 12 to 14 mg / m² given as a short intravenous infusion every 21 days.
 For induction, the recommended dosage is 12 mg / m² of NOVANTRONE daily on Days 1 - 3 given as an intravenous infusion, and 100 mg / m² of cytarabine for 7 days given as a continuous 24 - hour infusion on Days 1 - 7.
 Consolidation therapy which was used in two large randomized multicenter trials consisted of NOVANTRONE, 12 mg / m² given by intravenous infusion daily on Days 1 and 2 and cytarabine, 100 mg / m² for 5 days given as a continuous 24 - hour infusion on Days 1 - 5.
 The dose of NOVANTRONE should be diluted to at least 50 mL with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (USP) or 5% Dextrose Injection (USP).
 Dosage (IU) = Body Weight (kg) × Desired Factor VIII Increase (IU / dL or % normal) × 0.5

 To administer Novoeight® through incompatible needleless connectors, withdraw the reconstituted product into a standard 10 mL sterile Luer - lock plastic syringe.
 The concentration of this product is 100 units of insulin per milliliter.
 The insulin substance (the cloudy material) settles at the bottom of the insulin reservoir, therefore, the Novolin 70 / 30 InnoLet (70% nph, human insulin isophane suspension and 30% regular, human insulin injection) must be rotated up and down so that the contents are uniformly mixed before a dose is given.
 The concentration of this product is 100 units of insulin per milliliter.
 Total daily insulin requirements vary and are usually between 0.5 and 1.0 units / kg / day.
 For intravenous use, Novolin R should be used at concentrations from 0.05 units / mL to 1.0 unit / mL in infusion systems using polypropylene infusion bags.
 Novolin R can be used with the following infusion fluids: 0.9% sodium chloride, 5% dextrose, or 10% dextrose with 40 mmol / L potassium chloride.
 PenFill®Cartridges for 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible delivery devices*
 Thereafter, turn the cartridge upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.
 Before each subsequent injection, turn the 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible delivery devices* upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other.
 Always remove the needle after each injection and store the 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible delivery device without a needle attached.
 *NovoLog® Mix 50 / 50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection) PenFill® cartridges are designed for use with Novo Nordisk 3 mL PenFill® cartridge compatible insulin delivery devices, with or without the addition of a NovoPen® 3 PenMate®, and NovoFine® disposable needles.
 Thereafter, turn the disposable NovoLog® Mix 50 / 50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection) FlexPen® Prefilled syringe upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other.
 Before each subsequent injection, turn the disposable NovoLog® Mix 50 / 50 (50% insulin aspart protamine suspension and 50% insulin aspart injection) FlexPen® Prefilled syringe upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other at least 10 times and until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy.
 The addition of protamine to the rapid - acting aspart insulin analog (NovoLog) results in insulin activity that is 30% short - acting and 70% long - acting.
 NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin)) is typically dosed on a twice - daily basis (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack).
 Thereafter, turn the NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin)) FlexPen upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other.
 Before each subsequent injection, turn the disposable NovoLog Mix 70 / 30 (insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart (rdna origin)) FlexPen upside down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the reservoir to the other at least 10 times and until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy.
 For bleeding episodes, the recommended dose of NovoSeven (coagulation factor viia (recombinant)) for hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors is 90 μg / kg given every two hours by bolus infusion until hemostasis is achieved, or until the treatment has been judged to be inadequate.
 Doses between 35 and 120 μg / kg have been used successfully in clinical trials for hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors, and both the dose and administration interval may be adjusted based on the severity of the bleeding and degree of hemostasis achieved13.
 For surgical interventions, an initial dose of 90 μg per kg body weight should be given immediately before the intervention and repeated at 2 - hour intervals for the duration of the surgery.
 Effective treatment has been achieved with doses as low as 10 μg / kg.
 The recommended dose range for the treatment of patients with acquired hemophilia is 70 - 90 μg / kg repeated every 2 - 3 hours until hemostasis is achieved.
 The largest number of treatments with any single dose was 90 μg / kg;of the 15 treated, 10 (67%) were effective and 2 (13%) were partially effective.
 NOVOTHYROX (levothyroxine sodium tablets) is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one - half to one hour before breakfast.
 The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg / kg / day (e.g., 100 - 125 mcg / day for a 70 kg adult).
 Older patients may require less than 1 mcg / kg / day.
 Levothyroxine doses greater than 200 mcg / day are seldom required.
 An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg / day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and / or drug interactions.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day, with gradual dose increments at 4 - 6 week intervals.
 In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day with increases of 25 mcg / day every 2 - 4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10 - 15 mcg / kg / day.
 A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg / day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4 - 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment.
 In infants with very low ( < 5 mcg / dL) or undetectable serum T4 concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium.
 However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2 - 4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.
 If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg / kg / day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level.
 Generally, TSH is supper ssed to < 0.1 mU / L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg / kg / day.
 In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1 to either 0.5 or 1.0 mU / L) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer.
 Table 1: Dosage for Noxafil Injection
 Compatible diluents and drug products are listed in Tables 2 and 3 below.
 Table 5: Dosage for Noxafil Oral Suspension
 Figure 1: A measured dosing spoon is provided, marked for doses of 2.5 mL and 5 mL.
 Use the lowest dose of Nplate to achieve and maintain a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding.
 The prescribed Nplate dose may consist of a very small volume (eg, 0.15 mL).
 Administer Nplate only with a syringe that contains 0.01 mL graduations.
 The initial dose for Nplate is 1 mcg / kg based on actual body weight.
 Use the actual body weight at initiation of therapy, then adjust the weekly dose of Nplate by increments of 1 mcg / kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding; do not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg / kg.
 In clinical studies, most patients who responded to Nplate achieved and maintained platelet counts ≥ 50 x 109 / L with a median dose of 2 mcg / kg.
 During Nplate therapy, assess CBCs, including platelet counts, weekly until a stable platelet count ( ≥ 50 x 109 / L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved.
 Discontinue Nplate if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks of Nplate therapy at the maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg / kg [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Nplate is supplied in single - dose vials as a sterile, preservative - free, white lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted as outlined in Table 1 and administered using a syringe with 0.01 mL graduations.
 Reconstituted Nplate can be kept at room temperature (25°C / 77°F) or refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for up to 24 hours prior to administration.
 For example, a 75 kg patient initiating therapy at 1 mcg / kg will begin with a dose of 75 mcg.
 Next, calculate the volume of Nplate solution that is given to the patient by dividing the microgram dose by the concentration of the reconstituted Nplate solution (500 mcg / mL).
 For this patient example, the 75 mcg dose is divided by 500 mcg / mL, resulting in an injection volume of 0.15 mL.
 As the injection volume may be very small, use a syringe with graduations to 0.01 mL.
 If the patient's platelet count is ≥ 50 x 109 / L, medical ITP therapies may be reduced or discontinued [see Clinical Studies].
 The usual recommended adult dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary.
 In nontolerant individuals, the recommended single maximum dose is 20 mg with a maximum total daily dose of 160 mg.
 Induction doses of nalbuphine hydrochloride range from 0.3 mg / kg to 3 mg / kg intravenously to be administered over a 10 to 15 minute period with maintenance doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg / kg in single intravenous administrations as required.
 The recommended dose of NUCALA is 100 mg administered once every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen.
 The oral solution contains 20 mg tapentadol per milliliter (mL), when writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.
 An oral syringe is supplied with dose marks corresponding directly to 2.5 mL (equals 50 mg) oral solution, 3.75 mL (equals 75 mg) oral solution, and 5 mL (equals 100 mg) oral solution.
 Initiate treatment with NUCYNTA oral solution in a dosing range of 50 mg (2.5 mL) to 100 mg (5 mL) every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.
 Subsequent dosing is 2.5 mL (equivalent to 50 mg), 3.75 mL (equivalent to 75 mg), or 5 mL (equivalent to 100 mg) every 4 to 6 hours and should be adjusted to maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable tolerability.
 Daily doses greater than 700 mg on the first day of therapy and 600 mg on subsequent days have not been studied and are not recommended.
 Patients can be converted from NUCYNTA oral solution to NUCYNTA ER using the equivalent total daily dose of NUCYNTA oral solution and dividing it into two equal doses of NUCYNTA ER separated by approximately 12 - hour intervals.
 As an example, a patient receiving 50 mg of NUCYNTA oral solution four times per day (200 mg / day) may be converted to 100 mg NUCYNTA ER twice a day.
 Initiate treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Score 7 to 9) with 50 mg no more frequently than once every 8 hours (maximum of three doses in 24 hours).
 No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Score 5 to 6) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Although the maximum approved total daily dose of NUCYNTAR® immediate - release formulation is 600 mg per day, the maximum total daily dose of NUCYNTA® ER is 500 mg. Do not exceed a total daily dose of NUCYNTA® ER of 500 mg.
 Initiate treatment with NUCYNTA® ER with the 50 mg tablet orally twice daily (approximately every 12 hours).
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is NUCYNTA® ER 50 mg orally twice daily (approximately every 12 hours).
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Patients can be converted from NUCYNTAR® to NUCYNTA® ER using the equivalent total daily dose of NUCYNTAR® and dividing it into two equal doses of NUCYNTA® ER separated by approximately 12 - hour intervals.
 As an example, a patient receiving 50 mg of NUCYNTAR® four times per day (200 mg / day) may be converted to 100 mg NUCYNTA® ER twice a day.
 Titrate patients to adequate analgesia with dose increases of 50 mg no more than twice daily every three days.
 In clinical studies, efficacy with NUCYNTA® ER was demonstrated relative to placebo in the dosage range of 100 mg to 250 mg twice daily [see Clinical Studies].
 In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Score 7 to 9), initiate treatment using 50 mg NUCYNTA® ER and administer no more frequently than once every 24 hours.
 The maximum recommended dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment is 100 mg of NUCYNTA® ER per day [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Score 5 to 6) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

 When administered as a component of a thiopental / narcotic induction - intubation paradigm as well as for production of long - duration neuromuscular block during surgery, 0.05 mg / kg (2 × ED95) NUROMAX (doxacurium chloride) produces good - to - excellent conditions for tracheal intubation in 5 minutes in approximately 90% of patients.
 Clinically effective neuromuscular block may be expected to last approximately 100 minutes on average (range: 39 to 232) following 0.05 mg / kg NUROMAX (doxacurium chloride) administered to patients receiving balanced anesthesia.
 An initial NUROMAX (doxacurium chloride) dose of 0.08 mg / kg (3 × ED95) should be reserved for instances in which a need for very prolonged neuromuscular block is anticipated.
 In approximately 90% of patients, good - to­excellent intubation conditions may be expected in 4 minutes after this dose; however, clinically effective block may be expected to persist for as long as 160 minutes or more (range: 110 to 338) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 When succinylcholine is administered to facilitate tracheal intubation in patients receiving balanced anesthesia, an initial dose of 0.025 mg / kg (ED95) NUROMAX (doxacurium chloride) provides about 60 minutes (range: 9 to 145) of clinically effective neuromuscular block for surgery.
 Maintenance dosing will generally be required about 60 minutes after an initial dose of 0.025 mg / kg NUROMAX (doxacurium chloride) or 100 minutes after an initial dose of 0.05 mg / kg NUROMAX (doxacurium chloride) during balanced anesthesia.
 Maintenance doses of 0.005 and 0.01 mg / kg NUROMAX (doxacurium chloride) each provide an average 30 minutes (range: 9 to 57) and 45 minutes (range: 14 to 108), respectively, of additional clinically effective neuromuscular block.
 When administered during halothane anesthesia, an initial dose of 0.03 mg / kg (ED95) produces maximum neuromuscular block in about 7 minutes (range: 5 to 11) and clinically effective block for an average of 30 minutes (range: 12 to 54).
 Under halothane anesthesia, 0.05 mg / kg produces maximum block in about 4 minutes (range: 2 to 10) and clinically effective block for 45 minutes (range: 30 to 80).

 All patients MUST begin treatment using one 200 mcg Onsolis film.
 Due to differences in pharmacokinetic properties and individual variability, patients switching from another oral transmucosal fentanyl product must be started on no greater than 200 mcg of Onsolis.
 If adequate pain relief is not achieved after one 200 mcg Onsolis film, titrate using multiples of the 200 mcg Onsolis film (for doses of 400, 600, or 800 mcg).
 Increase the dose by 200 mcg in each subsequent episode until the patient reaches a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects.
 When multiple 200 mcg Onsolis films are used, they should not be placed on top of each other and may be placed on both sides of the mouth.
 If adequate pain relief is not achieved after 800 mcg Onsolis (i.e., four 200 mcg Onsolis films), and the patient has tolerated the 800 mcg dose, treat the next episode by using one 1200 mcg Onsolis film.
 Doses above 1200 mcg Onsolis should not be used.
 Once adequate pain relief is achieved with a dose between 200 and 800 mcg Onsolis, the patient should use or safely dispose of all remaining 200 mcg Onsolis films [see Disposal of Onsolis].
 Patients who require 1200 mcg Onsolis, should dispose of all remaining unused 200 mcg Onsolis films [see Disposal of Onsolis].
 The patient should then get a prescription for Onsolis films of the dose determined by titration (i.e., 200, 400, 600, 800, or 1200 mcg) to treat subsequent episodes.
 Single doses should be separated by at least 2 hours.
 The recommended dosage of ONZETRA is 22 mg of sumatriptan nasal powder (2 nosepieces), administered using the Xsail breath - powered delivery device.

 To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that oxymorphone is available as both immediate - release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets and extended - release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets [see Dosage Forms and Strengths].
 Initiate treatment with OPANA in a dosing range of 10 to 20 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.
 Do not initiate treatment with doses higher than 20 mg because of the potential serious adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies].
 In general, it is safest to start OPANA therapy by administering half of the calculated total daily dose of OPANA in 4 to 6 equally divided doses, every 4 - 6 hours.
 For example, approximately 10 mg of OPANA four times daily may be required to provide pain relief equivalent to a total daily IM dose of 4 mg oxymorphone.
 Use OPANA with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment, starting with the lowest dose (e.g., 5 mg) and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Use OPANA with caution in patients with creatinine clearance rates less than 50 mL / min., starting with the lowest dose (e.g., 5 mg) and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Exercise caution in the selection of the starting dose of OPANA for an elderly patient by starting with the lowest dose (e.g., 5 mg) and titrate slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Use in Specific Populations].
 When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.
 To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that oxymorphone is available as both immediate - release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets and extended - release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets [see Dosage Forms and Strengths].
 OPANA ER tablets must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
 Initiate treatment with OPANA ER with the 5 mg tablet orally every 12 - hours.
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OPANA ER 5 mg orally every 12 hours.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Convert patients receiving parenteral oxymorphone to OPANA ER by administering 10 times the patient's total daily parenteral oxymorphone dose as OPANA ER in two equally divided doses (e.g., [IV dose x 10] divided by 2).
 As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patient's 24 - hour oral oxymorphone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate - release opioid) than to overestimate the 24 - hour oral oxymorphone requirements which could result in adverse reactions.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to OPANA ER:
 Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid oxycodone 20 mg BID 20 mg former opioid 2 times daily = 40 mg total daily dose of former opioid
 Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral (active opioid) based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1 40 mg total daily dose of former opioid x 0.5 mg Conversion Factor = 20 mg of oral (active opioid) daily
 10 mg OPANA ER every 12 hours
 In opioid - naïve patients with mild hepatic impairment, initiate treatment with the 5 mg dose.
 In patients with creatinine clearance rates less than 50 mL / min, start OPANA ER in the opioid - naïve patient with the 5 mg dose.
 Initiate dosing with OPANA ER in patients 65 years of age and over using the 5 mg dose and monitor closely for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression when initiating and titrating OPANA ER to adequate analgesia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

 Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal.
 Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg / kg preferably taken once at bedtime.
 The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg / kg not to exceed 10 mg / day.
 At doses above 0.05 mg / kg / day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed.
 In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, ORAP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg / kg / day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics).
 In general, treatment with ORAP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses.
 Most patients are maintained at less than 0.2 mg / kg / day, or 10 mg / day, whichever is less.
 Doses greater than 0.2 mg / kg / day or 10 mg / day are not recommended.
 At doses above 4 mg / day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed.
 In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, ORAP doses should not exceed 4 mg / day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics).
 This may become important in the treatment of conditions that require tapering doses that cannot be adequately accommodated by Orapred ODT (prednisolone sodium phosphate) , e.g., tapering the dose below 10 mg.
 The initial dose of Orapred ODT (prednisolone sodium phosphate) may vary from 10 to 60 mg (prednisolone base) per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.
 The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg / kg / day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg / m2bsa / day).
 The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg / m2 / day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate - day therapy at 40 mg / m2 / day.
 The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corricosteroids and long - acting bronchodilators is 1 - 2 mg / kg / day in single or divided doses.
 For the purpose of comparison, one 10 mg Orapred ODT tablet (13.4 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorricoids:
 Typically, one cartridge (1.7g) or less of Oraqix will be sufficient for one quadrant of the dentition.
 The maximum recommended dose of Oraqix at one treatment session is 5 cartridges, i.e., 8.5g gel.
 In pediatric patients weighing between ≥ 15 kg and < 30 kg, the maximum dose of OraVerse recommend is ½ cartridge (0.2 mg).
 A dose of more than 1 cartridge [0.4 mg] of OraVerse has not been studied in children less than 4 years of age.)
 The recommended dosing schedule for ORAVIG is the application of one 50 mg buccalablet to the upper gum region (canine fossa) once daily for 14 consecutive days.
 The recommended dosing for ORBACTIV is a single 1200 mg dose administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours in patients 18 years and older.
 Three ORBACTIV 400 mg vials need to be reconstituted and diluted to prepare a single 1200 mg intravenous dose.
 Aseptic technique should be used to reconstitute three ORBACTIV 400 mg vials.
 Diluted intravenous solution in an infusion bag should be used within 6 hours when stored at room temperature, or used within 12 hours when refrigerated at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).
 1 or 2 capsules every 4 hours as needed.
 Total daily dosage should not exceed 6 capsules.
 ORENCIA 125 mg should be administered by subcutaneous injection once weekly and may be initiated with or without an intravenous loading dose.
 For patients initiating therapy with an intravenous loading dose, ORENCIA should be initiated with a single intravenous infusion (as per body weight categories listed in Table 1), followed by the first 125 mg subcutaneous injection administered within a day of the intravenous infusion.
 The recommended dose of ORENCIA for patients 6 to 17 years of age with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who weigh less than 75 kg is 10 mg / kg intravenously calculated based on the patient's body weight at each administration.
 Pediatric patients weighing 75 kg or more should be administered ORENCIA following the adult intravenous dosing regimen, not to exceed a maximum dose of 1000 mg. ORENCIA should be administered as a 30 - minute intravenous infusion.
 Each ORENCIA vial provides 250 mg of abatacept for administration.
 The ORENCIA powder in each vial must be reconstituted with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, using only the silicone - free disposable syringe provided with each vial and an 18 - to 21 - gauge needle.
 After reconstitution, the concentration of abatacept in the vial will be 25 mg / mL.
 ORENCIA Injection, 125 mg / syringe is not intended for intravenous infusion.
 Patients using ORENCIA for subcutaneous administration should be instructed to inject the full amount in the syringe (1 mL), which provides 125 mg of ORENCIA, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use.
 The recommended starting dose of Orenitram is 0.25 mg twice daily (BID) with food, taken approximately 12 hours apart or 0.125 mg three times daily (TID) with food, taken approximately 8 hours apart.
 The recommended increment is 0.25 or 0.5 mg BID or 0.125 mg TID every 3 - 4 days.
 The dose of Remodulin can be reduced up to 30 ng / kg / min per day and the dose of Orenitram simultaneously increased up to 6 mg per day (2 mg TID) if tolerated.
 Orenitram total daily dose (mg) = 0.0072 x Remodulin dose (ng / kg / min) x weight (kg)
 In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A) start at 0.125 mg BID with 0.125 mg BID dose increments every 3 to 4 days.
 When co - administered with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) the initial dose is 0.125 mg BID with 0.125 mg BID dose increments every 3 to 4 days.
 If a patient misses two or more doses, restart at a lower dose and re - titrate.
 Remodulin (ng / kg / min) = 139 x Orenitram total daily dose (mg) / weight (kg)
 When discontinuing Orenitram, reduce the dose in steps of 0.5 to 1 mg per day [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended starting dosage of ORFADIN is 0.5 mg / kg orally twice daily.
 If succinylacetone is still detectable one month after the start of nitisinone treatment, increase the nitisinone dosage to 0.75 mg / kg twice daily.
 A maximum dosage of 1 mg / kg orally twice daily may be needed based on the evaluation of all biochemical parameters.
 Tablets — Adults and children 12 years of age and older: One to 2 tablets (200 mg to 400 mg) every four hours, not to exceed 2400 mg (12 tablets) in 24 hours.
 A dose reduction to 2 tablets in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class B).
 Therefore, use with caution at a maximum dose of 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening, or less, in patients with severe hepatic impairment after weighing the risks and benefits of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and PATIENT INFORMATION].
 However, when initiating ORKAMBI in patients currently taking strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole), reduce ORKAMBI dose to 1 tablet daily for the first week of treatment.
 If ORKAMBI is interrupted for more than 1 week and then re - initiated while taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, patients should reduce ORKAMBI dose to 1 tablet daily for the first week of treatment re - initiation.
 The initial dose of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) for street addicts should be 20 to 40 mg. Each subsequent dose, administered at 48 - or 72 - hour intervals, may be adjusted in increments of 5 to 10 mg until a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady - state is reached, usually within 1 or 2 weeks (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE ).
 The suggested initial 3 - times - a - week dose of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) for such patients is 1.2 to 1.3 times the daily methadone maintenance dose being replaced.
 This initial dose should not exceed 120 mg and subsequent doses, administered at 48 - or 72 - hour intervals, should be adjusted according to clinical response.
 The crossover from methadone to ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) should be accomplished in a single dose; complete transfer to ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) is simpler and preferable to more complex regimens involving escalating doses of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) and decreasing doses of methadone.
 Most patients will be stabilized on doses in the range of 60 to 90 mg, 3 - times - a - week.
 Doses as low as 10 mg and as high as 140 mg three times a week have been given in clinical studies.
 schedule complains of withdrawal on Sundays, the recommended dosage adjustment is to increase the Friday dose in 5 to 10 mg increments up to 40% over the Mon. / Wed.
 dose or to a maximum of 140 mg.
 The maximum total amount of ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) recommended for any patient is 140 - 140 - 140 mg or 130 - 130 - 180 mg on a thrice - weekly schedule or 140 mg every other day.
 Refer to 42 CFR Part 8 for specific restrictions.
 Following a lapse of one ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) dose:
 Patients should be reinducted at an initial dose of 1 / 2 or 3 / 4 their previous ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) dose, followed by increases of 5 to 10 mg every dosing day (48 - or 72 - hours intervals) until their previous maintenance dose is achieved.
 Subsequent increases or decreases of 5 to 10 mg in the daily methadone dose may be given to control symptoms of withdrawal or, less likely, symptoms of excessive sedation, in accordance with clinical observations.
 There is a limited experience with detoxifying patients from ORLAAM (levomethadyl acetate) in a systematic manner, and both gradual reduction (5 to 10% a week) and abrupt withdrawal schedules have been used successfully.

 Individual patients may show a better response to 300 mg of Orudis (ketoprofen) daily as compared to 200 mg, although in well - controlled clinical trials patients on 300 mg did not show greater mean effectiveness.
 When treating patients with 300 mg / day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset potential increased risk.
 In patients with mildly impaired renal function, the maximum recommended total daily dose of Orudis (ketoprofen) or Oruvail is 150 mg.
 In patients with a more severe renal impairment (GFR less than 25 mL / min / 1.73 m2 or end - stage renal impairment), the maximum total daily dose of Orudis (ketoprofen) or Oruvail should not exceed 100 mg.
 It is recommended that for patients with impaired liver function and serum albumin concentration less than 3.5 g / dL, the maximum initial total daily dose of Orudis (ketoprofen) or Oruvail should be 100 mg.

 The recommended starting dose of ketoprofen in otherwise healthy patients is for Orudis (ketoprofen) 75 mg three times or 50 mg four times a day, or for Oruvail 200 mg administered once a day.
 The recommended maximum daily dose of ketoprofen is 300 mg / day for Orudis (ketoprofen) or 200 mg / day for Oruvail.
 Dosages higher than 300 mg / day of Orudis (ketoprofen) or 200 mg / day of Oruvail are not recommended because they have not been studied.
 The usual dose of Orudis (ketoprofen) recommended for mild - to - moderate pain and dysmenorrhea is 25 to 50 mg every 6 to 8 hours as necessary.
 A larger dose may be tried if the patients response to a previous dose was less than satisfactory, but doses above 75 mg have not been shown to give added analgesia.
 Daily doses above 300 mg are not recommended because they have not been adequately studied.
 The OSENI dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 25 mg / 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by hemoglobin A1c (A1C).

 When used preoperatively the dose should be given one to one and one - half hours before surgery to achieve maximal reduction of intraocular pressure before operation.
 Usually a maximum reduction in intracranial pressure in adults can be achieved with a dose of 0.25 g / kg given not more frequently than every six to eight hours.
 The usual adult dosage ranges from 20 to 100 g in a 24 hour period, but in most instances an adequate response will be achieved at a dosage of approximately 50 to 100 g in a 24 hour period.
 The rate of administration is usually adjusted to maintain a urine flow of at least 30 to 50 mL / hour.
 Such a test dose may be approximately 0.2 g / kg body weight (about 75 mL of a 20% solution or 100 mL of a 15% solution) infused in a period of three to five minutes to produce a urine flow of at least 30 to 50 mL / hour.

 Subsequent dose increases can be made at weekly intervals in 600 mg per day increments to achieve the recommended daily dose.
 In pediatric patients 6 years to 17 years of age, initiate treatment at a daily dose of 8 mg / kg to 10 mg / kg once daily, not to exceed 600 mg per day in the first week.
 Subsequent dose increases can be made at weekly intervals in 8 mg / kg to 10 mg / kg increments once daily, not to exceed 600 mg, to achieve the target daily dose.
 In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / minute), initiate Oxtellar XR® at one - half the usual starting dose (300 mg per day).
 Subsequent dose increases can be made at weekly intervals in increments of 300 mg to 450 mg per day to achieve the desired clinical response.
 In geriatric patients, consider starting at a lower dose (300 mg or 450 mg per day).
 Subsequent dose increases can be made at weekly intervals in increments of 300 mg to 450 mg per day to achieve the desired clinical effect [see Use In Specific Populations].
 Consider initiating dose at 900 mg once per day [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 The starting dosage for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours.
 Adult patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 If switching from other oral oxycodone formulations to OXYCONTIN, administer one half of the patient's total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCONTIN every 12 hours
 Discontinue all other around - the - clock opioid drugs when OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours.
 Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch.
 For the two days immediately preceding dosing with OXYCONTIN, patients must be taking a minimum of 20 mg per day of oxycodone or its equivalent.
 OXYCONTIN is not appropriate for use in pediatric patients requiring less than a 20 mg total daily dose.
 Table 1, based on clinical trial experience, displays the conversion factor when switching pediatric patients 11 years and older (under the conditions described above) from opioids to OXYCONTIN.
 As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patientâ€™s 24 - hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate - release opioid) than to overestimate the 24 - hour oral oxycodone requirements and manage an adverse reaction.
 If the calculated OXYCONTIN total daily dosage is less than 20 mg, there is no safe strength for conversion and do not initiate OXYCONTIN.
 Example conversion from a single opioid (e.g., hydrocodone) to OXYCONTIN: Using the conversion factor of 0.9 for oral hydrocodone in Table 1, a total daily hydrocodone dosage of 50 mg is converted to 45 mg of oxycodone per day or 22.5 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours.
 After rounding down to the nearest strength available, the recommended OXYCONTIN starting dosage is 20 mg every 12 hours.
 Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, start with a conservative conversion: substitute 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours for each 25 mcg per hour fentanyl transdermal patch.
 Because steady - state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCONTIN dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days.
 OXYTROL 3.9 mg / day should be applied to dry, intact skin on the abdomen, hip, or buttock twice weekly (every 3 or 4 days).
 The tip of the needle is advanced within the sclera for about 1 mm (parallel to the limbus), then re - directed toward the center of the eye and advanced until penetration of the sclera is completed and the vitreous cavity is entered.
 Loading doses of 800 to 1,600 mg / day are required for 1 to 3 weeks (occasionally longer) until initial therapeutic response occurs.
 (Administration of Pacerone® Tablets in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1,000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.)
 When adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, Pacerone® Tablets dose should be reduced to 600 to 800 mg / day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg / day (see “CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Monitoring Effectiveness”).
 Some patients may require larger maintenance doses, up to 600 mg / day, and some can be controlled on lower doses.
 Pacerone® Tablets may be administered as a single daily dose, or in patients with severe gastrointestinal intolerance, as a b.i.d.
 Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel injection, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel injection, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) IV 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel injection.
 For patients with non - small cell lung carcinoma, the recommended regimen, given every 3 weeks, is paclitaxel injection administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg / m² followed by cisplatin, 75 mg / m².
 For patients with AIDS - related Kaposi's sarcoma, paclitaxel injection administered at a dose of 135 mg / m² given intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks or at a dose of 100 mg / m² given intravenously over 3 hours every 2 weeks is recommended (dose intensity 45 - 50 mg / m² / week).
 In the 2 clinical trials evaluating these schedules (see Clinical Studies: AIDS - Related Kaposi's Sarcoma), the former schedule (135 mg / m² every 3 weeks) was more toxic than the latter.
 In addition, all patients with low performance status were treated with the latter schedule (100 mg / m² every 2 weeks).
 Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil < 500 cells / mm³ for a week or longer) or severe peripheral neuropathy during paclitaxel injection therapy should have dosage reduced by 20% for subsequent courses of paclitaxel injection.
 Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration (see PRECAUTIONS: Injection Site Reaction ).
 Paclitaxel Injection should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in Ringer's Injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg / mL.
 No significant losses in potency have been noted following simulated delivery of the solution through IV tubing containing an in - line (0.22 micron) filter.
 Patients considered opioid - tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg of morphine daily, or at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, or at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer.
 As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patient's 24 - hour oral hydromorphone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate - release opioid) than to overestimate the 24 - hour oral hydromorphone requirements which could result in adverse reaction.
 The recommended starting dose of PALLADONE is 50% of the calculated estimate of daily hydromorphone requirement.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to PALLADONE:
 Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydromorphone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1
 Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of PALLADONE to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the calculated oral hydromorphone dose.
 To calculate the 24 - hour PALLADONE dose, use a conversion factor of 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of PALLADONE.
 Step 2: Use the conversion factor of 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch to 12 mg of PALLADONE.
 Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose of PALLADONE to be given every 24 hours, which is 50% of the converted dose.
 Dosage adjustments of PALLADONE may be made in increments of 4 to 8 mg every 3 to 4 days as needed to achieve adequate analgesia.
 When a patient no longer requires therapy with PALLADONE, taper doses gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 or 3 days down to a dose of 12 mg before discontinuation of therapy, to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the opioid - tolerant patient.
 25 mg three or four times daily; dosage should begin at a low level and be increased as required.
 When doses above 100 mg daily are administered, plasma levels of nortriptyline should be monitored and maintained in the optimum range of 50 to 150 ng / mL.
 Doses above 150 mg / day are not recommended.
 30 to 50 mg / day, in divided doses, or the total daily dosage may be given once a day.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with Pamelor is unclear.

 PEDIARIX may be used to complete the first 3 doses of the IPV series in children who have received 1 or 2 doses of IPV from a different manufacturer and are also scheduled to receive the other vaccine components of PEDIARIX.
 For Acute Otitis Media in Children:   The dose of Pediazole (erythromycin and sulfisoxazole) can be calculated based on the erythromycin component (50 mg / kg / day) or the sulfisoxazole component (150 mg / kg / day to a maximum of 6 g / day).
 The total daily dose of Pediazole (erythromycin and sulfisoxazole) should be administered in equally divided doses three or four times a day for 10 days.Pediazole (erythromycin and sulfisoxazole) may be administered without regard to meals.
 For adults, 4 drops of the suspension should be instilled into the affected ear 3 or 4 times daily.
 For infants and children, 3 drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal.
 Infants 2 to 14 months of age should receive a 0.5 mL dose of vaccine ideally beginning at 2 months of age followed by a 0.5 mL dose 2 months later (or as soon as possible thereafter).

 The recommended dosage for the induction of remission and the symptomatic treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis is 1g (4 PENTASA 250 mg capsules or 2 PENTASA 500 mg capsules) 4 times a day for a total daily dosage of 4g.
 It is advisable to inject a small "test" dose of 25 to 75 mg (1 to 3 mL of a 2.5% solution) of Pentothal (Thiopental Sodium for Injection, USP) to assess tolerance or unusual sensitivity to Pentothal (thiopental sodium) , and pausing to observe patient reaction for at least 60 seconds.
 If unexpectedly deep anesthesia develops or if respiratory depression occurs, consider these possibilities: (1) the patient may be unusually sensitive to Pentothal (thiopental sodium) , (2) the solution may be more concentrated than had been assumed, or (3) the patient may have received too much premedication.
 Moderately slow induction can usually be accomplished in the "average" adult by injection of 50 to 75 mg (2 to 3 mL of a 2.5% solution) at intervals of 20 to 40 seconds, depending on the reaction of the patient.
 Once anesthesia is established, additional injections of 25 to 50 mg can be given whenever the patient moves.
 When Pentothal (Thiopental Sodium for Injection, USP) is used for induction in balanced anesthesia with a skeletal muscle relaxant and an inhalation agent, the total dose of Pentothal (thiopental sodium) can be estimated and then injected in two to four fractional doses.
 As an initial dose, 210 to 280 mg (3 to 4 mg / kg) of Pentothal (thiopental sodium) is usually required for rapid induction in the average adult (70 kg).
 For the control of convulsive states following anesthesia (inhalation or local) or other causes, 75 to 125 mg (3 to 5 mL of a 2.5% solution) should be given as soon as possible after the convulsion begins.
 Convulsions following the use of a local anesthetic may require 125 to 250 mg of Pentothal (thiopental sodium) given over a ten minute period.
 In neurosurgical patients, intermittent bolus injections of 1.5 to 3.5 mg / kg of body weight may be given to reduce intraoperative elevations of intracranial pressure, if adequate ventilation is provided.
 After a test dose, Pentothal (Thiopental Sodium for Injection, USP) is injected at a slow rate of 100 mg / mm (4 mL / min of a 2.5% solution) with the patient counting backwards from 100.
 At this concentration, the rate of administration should not exceed 50 mL / min.
 This is due primarily to the high alkaline pH (10 to 11) of clinical concentrations of the drug.
 Inject the artery with a dilute solution of papaverine, 40 to 80 mg, or 10 mL of 1% procaine, to inhibit smooth muscle spasm.

 Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times daily and the dosage then adjusted to suit individual requirements.
 For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one 100 mg capsule three to four times a day.
 An increase up to one 200 mg PHENYTEK®three times a day may be made, if necessary.
 In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once - a - day dosage with 300 mg PHENYTEK® may be considered.
 Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak plasma levels, biologic half - life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent.
 Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at 2 hour intervals.

 Precedex must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to achieve required concentration (4 mcg / mL) prior to administration.
 To prepare the infusion, withdraw 2 mL of Precedex Injection, and add to 48 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a total of 50 mL.
 Although Precedex is dosed to effect, it is advisable to use administration components made with synthetic or coated natural rubber gaskets.
 Dosage of PRECOSE must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg t.i.d.
 The recommended starting dosage of PRECOSE is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.
 This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d.
 Once a 25 mg t.i.d.
 The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d.
 to 50 mg t.i.d.
 Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d.
 The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d.
 to 100 mg t.i.d.
 However, since patients with low body weight may be at increased risk for elevated serum transaminases, only patients with body weight > 60 kg should be considered for dose titration above 50 mg t.i.d.
 If no further reduction in postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels is observed with titration to 100 mg t.i.d., consideration should be given to lowering the dose.
 The maximum recommended dose for patients ≤ 60 kg is 50 mg t.i.d.
 The maximum recommended dose for patients > 60 kg is 100 mg t.i.d.

 Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 p.m. to a peak level about 6 a.m. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m.
 During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation.
 Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (prednisolone (prednisolone (prednisolone tablets) tablets) tablets) (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used.
 Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days.
 Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone (prednisolone (prednisolone (prednisolone tablets) tablets) tablets) , are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1 1 / 4 days to 1 ½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate - day therapy.

 There may be an increased risk of seizures when doses of 500 mg every 12 hours are administered to these patients.
 (See Reduced Intravenous Dosage Schedule for Adults with Impaired Renal Function and / or Body Weight < 70 kg.)
 For pediatric patients ≥ 3 months of age, the recommended dose for non - CNS infections is 15 - 25 mg / kg / dose administered every six hours.
 Based on studies in adults, the maximum daily dose for treatment of infections with fully susceptible organisms is 2.0 g per day, and of infections with moderately susceptible organisms (primarily some strains of P. aeruginosa) is 4.0 g / day.
 Higher doses (up to 90 mg / kg / day in older children) have been used in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 For pediatric patients ≤ 3 months of age (weighing ≥ 1,500 g), the following dosage schedule is recommended for non - CNS infections:
 < 1 wk of age: 25 mg / kg every 12 hrs 1 - 4 wks of age: 25 mg / kg every 8 hrs 4 wks - 3 mos.
 of age: 25 mg / kg every 6 hrs.
 Doses less than or equal to 500 mg should be given by intravenous infusion over 15 to 30 minutes.
 Doses greater than 500 mg should be given by intravenous infusion over 40 to 60 minutes.
 is not recommended in pediatric patients < 30 kg with impaired renal function, as no data are available.
 Contents of the vials must be suspended and transferred to 100 mL of an appropriate infusion solution.
 A suggested procedure is to add approximately 10 mL from the appropriate infusion solution (see list of diluents under Compatibility And Stability) to the vial.
 Repeat with an additional 10 mL of infusion solution to ensure complete transfer of vial contents to the infusion solution.
 in ADD - Vantage® vials should be reconstituted with ADD - Vantage® diluent containers containing 100 mL of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 100 mL 5% Dextrose Injection.
 The recommended dose for pediatric patients with acute otitis media is 10 mg / kg trimethoprim per 24 hours, given in divided doses every 12 hours for 10 days.
 The usual oral adult dosage is 100 mg (10 mL) every 12 hours or 200 mg (20 mL) every 24 hours, each for 10 days.
 For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections other than gonorrhea in men and women, the usual dose is 500 mg qid in equally spaced doses; severe or chronic infections may require larger doses.
 For the treatment of gonerrhea in both men and women, a single oral dose of 3.5 grams of ampicillin administered simultaneously with 1 gram of probenecid is recommended.
 For respiratory tract infections, the usual dose is 250 mg qid in equally spaced doses.
 For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections, the usual dose is 100 mg / kg / day total, qid in equally divided and spaced doses.
 For respiratory infections, the usual dose is 50 mg / kg / day total, in equally divided and spaced doses three to four times daily.
 Initial therapy in adults: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day.
 The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose.
 Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give a greater effect.
 If blood pressure is not controlled with PRINIVIL alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg).
 The recommended starting dose in adult patients with hypertension taking diuretics is 5 mg once per day [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 For pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL / min / 1.73 m², the recommended starting dose is 0.07 mg / kg once daily (up to 5 mg total).
 Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response up to a maximum of 0.61 mg / kg (up to 40 mg) once daily.
 Doses above 0.61 mg / kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended starting dose for PRINIVIL, when used with diuretics and (usually) digitalis as adjunctive therapy is 5 mg once daily.
 The recommended starting dose in these patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq / L) is 2.5 mg once daily.
 Increase as tolerated to a maximum of 40 mg once daily.
 In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, give PRINIVIL 5 mg orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg once daily.
 Initiate therapy with 2.5 mg in patients with a low systolic blood pressure (100 - 120 mmHg) during the first 3 days after the infarct [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 If hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg) consider doses of 2.5 or 5 mg.
 If prolonged hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) discontinue PRINIVIL.
 No dose adjustment of PRINIVIL is required in patients with creatinine clearance > 30 mL / min.
 In patients with creatinine clearance 10 - 30 mL / min, reduce the initial dose of PRINIVIL to half of the usual recommended dose (i.e., hypertension, 5 mg; heart failure or acute MI, 2.5 mg).
 For patients on hemodialysis or creatinine clearance < 10 mL / min, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Lisinopril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 10 - 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 - 50 mg.
 In clinical trials of lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 - 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 - 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component.
 A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to PRINZIDE 10 - 12.5 or PRINZIDE 20 - 12.5.
 Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar or greater blood pressure control with less potassium loss if they are switched to PRINZIDE 10 - 12.5.
 Dosage higher than lisinopril 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg should not be used.
 The usual regimens of therapy with PRINZIDE need not be adjusted as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL / min / 1.73 m² (serum creatinine approximately ≤ 3 mg / dL or 265 μmol / L).
 PHOXILLUM replacement solutions contain 2 different combinations of active ingredients (2 different products with varying ingredient amounts).
 See Table 1 for the concentrations of the active ingredients (after mixing) in these 10 different replacement solutions (total volume is 5 Liters).

 The total phosphate concentration should not exceed 1.2 mmol / L.
 The recommended dose for PRISTIQ is 50 mg once daily, with or without food.
 The 50 mg dose is both a starting dose and the therapeutic dose.
 In clinical studies, doses of 10 mg to 400 mg per day were studied.
 In clinical studies, doses of 50 mg to 400 mg per day were shown to be effective, although no additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg per day and adverse reactions and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses.
 The 25 mg per day dose is intended for a gradual reduction in dose when discontinuing treatment.
 The maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate renal impairment (24 - hr creatinine clearance [CrCl] = 30 to 50 mL / min, Cockcroft - Gault [C - G]) is 50 mg per day.
 The maximum recommended dose in patients with severe renal impairment (24 - hr CrCl less than 30 mL / min, C - G) or end - stage renal disease (ESRD) is 25 mg every day or 50 mg every other day.
 The recommended dose in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 50 mg per day.
 Dose escalation above 100 mg per day is not recommended [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Longer - term efficacy of PRISTIQ (50 - 400 mg) was established in two maintenance trials [see Clinical Studies].
 The 25 mg dose is available for discontinuing therapy.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with PRISTIQ is unclear.
 The recommended dose of Privigen for patients with PI is 200 to 800 mg / kg (2 to 8 mL / kg), administered every 3 to 4 weeks.
 The recommended dose of Privigen for patients with chronic ITP is 1 g / kg (10 mL / kg) administered daily for 2 consecutive days, resulting in a total dosage of 2 g / kg.
 Carefully consider the relative risks and benefits before prescribing the high dose regimen (e.g., 1 g / kg / day for 2 days) in patients at increased risk of thrombosis, hemolysis, acute kidney injury, or volume overload [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The following patients may be at risk of developing systemic reactions (mimicking symptoms of an inflammatory response or infection) on rapid infusion of Privigen (greater than 4 mg / kg / min [0.04 mL / kg / min]): 1) those who have never received Privigen or another IgG product or who have not received it within the past 8 weeks, and 2) those who are switching from another IgG product.
 These patients should be started at a slow rate of infusion (e.g., 0.5 mg / kg / min [0.005 mL / kg / min] or less) and gradually increase as tolerated.
 For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of symptoms associated with bronchospasm, the usual dosage for adults and children 4 years and older is two inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours.
 In some patients, one inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient.
 The usual dosage for adults and children 4 years of age or older is two inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.
 If the patient has more than one PROAIR HFA inhaler, the patient should wash each one separately to prevent attaching the wrong canister to the wrong plastic actuator.
 When the dose counter reaches 20, the color of the numbers will change to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist for a refill of medication or consult their physician for a prescription refill.
 PROAIR HFA inhaler should be discarded when the dose counter displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first.
 For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of symptoms associated with bronchospasm, the recommended dosage for adults and children 4 years of age or older is 2 inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours.
 In some patients, 1 inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient.
 For prevention of exercise - induced bronchospasm, the recommended dosage for adults and children 4 years of age or older is 2 inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.
 When the dose counter reaches 20, the color of the numbers will change to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist for a refill of medication or consult their physician for a prescription refill.
 Discard PROAIR RESPICLICK 13 months after opening the foil pouch, when the dose counter displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
 The recommended dose of ProAmatine® is 10 mg, 3 times daily.
 Single doses as high as 20 mg have been given to patients, but severe and persistent systolic supine hypertension occurs at a high rate (about 45%) at this dose.
 Total daily doses greater than 30 mg have been tolerated by some patients, but their safety and usefulness have not been studied systematically or established.
 The recommended adult dosage is 1 tablet of probenecid and colchicine daily for one week, followed by 1 tablet twice a day thereafter.
 A daily dosage of 2 tablets may be adequate.
 However, if necessary, the daily dosage may be increased by 1 tablet every four weeks within tolerance (and usually not above 4 tablets per day) if symptoms of gouty arthritis are not controlled or the 24 hour uric acid excretion is not above 700 mg. As noted, probenecid may not be effective in chronic renal insufficiency particularly when the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL / minute or less.
 As uric acid tends to crystallize out of an acid urine, a liberal fluid intake is recommended, as well as sufficient sodium bicarbonate (3 to 7.5 g daily) or potassium citrate (7.5 g daily) to maintain an alkaline urine (see PRECAUTIONS).
 When acute attacks have been absent for six months or more and serum urate levels remain within normal limits, the daily dosage of probenecid and colchicine may be decreased by 1 tablet every six months.
 823(g), use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe or dispense this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription.
 After one insertion in each arm, most patients should be transitioned back to a transmucosal buprenorphine - containing product for continued treatment.

 There is no clinical experience with insertion of PROBUPHINE beyond a single insertion in each arm.
 After one insertion in each arm, additional cycles of treatment should only be considered if the potential benefits of continuing PROBUPHINE outweigh the potential risks of additional insertion and removal procedures, taking into account the experience of the healthcare provider with PROBUPHINE procedures and related procedures, and the clinical need of the patient for ongoing treatment with subdermal medication.
 Approximately three liters per day of ProcalAmine (amino acid and glycerin) will provide a total of 90 grams of amino acids, 390 nonprotein calories and the recommended daily intake of principal intra - and extracellular electrolytes for the stable patient.
 Two to three g / kg of body weight for infants with adequate calories are generally sufficient to satisfy protein needs and promote positive nitrogen balance.
 Solutions administered by peripheral vein should not exceed twice normal serum osmolarity (718 mOsmol / L).
 In pediatric patients, the final solution should not exceed twice normal serum osmolarity (718 mOsmol / L).
 As a general guide, for younger patients with normal renal function, an initial total daily oral dose of up to 50 mg / kg of body weight of procainamide hydrochloride extended - release tablets may be used, given in divided doses, every six hours, to maintain therapeutic blood levels.
 500 mg q6 hours
 750 mg q6 hours
 1 g q6 hours
 1.25 g q6 hours
 Therapy should be initiated with the 10 mg capsule.
 The starting dose is one 10 mg capsule, swallowed whole, 3 times / day.
 The usual effective dose range is 10 – 20 mg three times daily.
 In such patients, doses of 20 – 30 mg three or four times daily may be effective.
 Doses above 120 mg daily are rarely necessary.
 More than 180 mg per day is not recommended.
 Based on the patient's physical activity level, attack frequency, and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption, the dose of PROCARDIA may be increased from 10 mg t.i.d.
 to 20 mg t.i.d.
 and then to 30 mg t.i.d.
 In hospitalized patients under close observation, the dose may be increased in 10 mg increments over four - to six - hour periods as required to control pain and arrhythmias due to ischemia.
 A single dose should rarely exceed 30 mg.
 Therapy for either hypertension or angina should be initiated with 30 or 60 mg once daily.
 Titration to doses above 120 mg are not recommended.
 Angina patients controlled on PROCARDIA capsules alone or in combination with other antianginal medications may be safely switched to PROCARDIA XL Extended Release Tablets at the nearest equivalent total daily dose (e.g., 30 mg t.i.d.
 of PROCARDIA capsules may be changed to 90 mg once daily of PROCARDIA XL Extended Release Tablets).
 Experience with doses greater than 90 mg in patients with angina is limited.
 Therefore, doses greater than 90 mg should be used with caution and only when clinically warranted.
 Prochieve® 8% is administered vaginally at a dose of 90 mg once daily in women who require progesterone supplementation.
 Prochieve® 8% is administered vaginally at a dose of 90 mg twice daily in women with partial or complete ovarian failure who require progesterone replacement.
 Note: The PATIENT INFORMATION SHEET contains special instructions for using the applicator at altitudes above 2500 feet in order to avoid a partial release of Prochieve® before vaginal insertion.

 The recommended starting dosage of PROCYSBI for cysteamine - naïve patients is 0.2 to 0.3 grams / m2 per day divided into two doses given every 12 hours.
 Table 1 shows the recommended weight - based starting dosage and the number of capsules needed to achieve each dose.
 Table 1: Recommended Weight - Based Starting Dosage ( to ¼ of maintenance dosage)
 The recommended maintenance dosage of PROCYSBI for cysteamine - naive patients is 1.3 gram / m per day, divided into two equal doses given every 12 hours.
 Table 2 shows the recommended weight - based maintenance dosage of PROCYSBI and the number of capsules needed to achieve each dose.
 Do not exceed 1.95 grams / m2 per day.
 Do not exceed 1.95 grams / m2 per day.
 According to the WHO International Standard, one unit approximates the activity in one mL of normal plasma.
 A 1% increase in factor IX (0.01 units) per unit administered per kg body weight can be expected1.
 Body weight (in kg) x Desired increase in Plasma Factor IX / Plasma Factor IX (Percent) x 1 Units / kg = Number of Factor IX Units Required
 Example: 50 kg X 25 (% increase) X 1 Units / kg = 1,250 Units of factor IX

 Amenorrhea: Five to 10 mg are given for six to eight consecutive days.
 Functional Uterine Bleeding: Five to 10 mg are given daily for six doses.
 The usual daily dosage is 3 to 8 mg / kg, divided into two or three equal doses every 8 or 12 hours.
 Ordinarily, an appropriate starting dosage is 3 mg / kg / day, divided into three equal doses every 8 hours.
 Thus an average adult would receive a starting dosage of approximately 200 mg daily.
 The usual daily dosage is 8 to 15 mg / kg divided into two or three equal doses every 8 to 12 hours.
 An appropriate starting dosage is 10 mg / kg / day, divided into three equal doses every 8 hours.
 The recommended starting dose of Prograf injection is 0.03 - 0.05 mg / kg / day in kidney and liver transplant and 0.01 mg / kg / day in heart transplant given as a continuous IV infusion.
 Prograf injection must be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a concentration between 0.004 mg / mL and 0.02 mg / mL prior to use.
 Adults: The recommended dose of ProHance (Gadoteridol) Injection is 0.1 mmol / kg (0.2 mL / kg) administered as a rapid intravenous infusion (10 mL / min - 60 mL / min) or bolus ( > 60 mL / min).
 In patients with normal renal function suspected of having poorly enhancing lesions, in the presence of negative or equivocal scans, a supplementary dose of 0.2 mmol / kg (0.4 mL / kg) may be given up to 30 minutes after the first dose.
 Children (2 - 18 years ): The recommended dose of ProHance is 0.1 mmol / kg (0.2 mL / kg) administered as a rapid intravenous infusion (10 mL / min - 60 mL / min) or bolus ( > 60 mL / min).

 Adults: The recommended dose of ProHance is 0.1 mmol / kg (0.2 mL / kg) administered as a rapid intravenous infusion (10 mL / min - 60 mL / min) or bolus ( > 60 mL / min).
 To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 mL normal saline flush.
 The immunizing dose is a single injection of 0.5 mL given intramuscularly in the outer aspect area of the vastus lateralis (mid - thigh) or deltoid.
 Each 0.5 mL dose contains 25 µg of purified capsular polysaccharide and 18 µg of conjugated diphtheria toxoid protein.
 A single dose of ProHIBiT (haemophilus b conjugate vaccine) ® should be administered to children 15 months of age and older, not previously immunized with a Hib conjugate vaccine.
 The “threshold” level of alpha1 - PI in the serum believed to provide adequate anti - elastase activity in the lung of individuals with alpha1 - antitrypsin deficiency is 80 mg / dL (based on commercial standards for alpha1 - PI immunologic assay).12,15,17 However, assays of alpha1 - PI based on commercial standards measure antigenic activity of alpha1 - PI, whereas the labeled potency value of alpha1 - PI is expressed as actual functional activity, i.e., actual capacity to neutralize porcine pancreatic elastase.
 The recommended dosage of Prolastin (alpha) is 60 mg / kg body weight administered once weekly.
 The recommended dosage of 60 mg / kg takes approximately 30 minutes to infuse.
 *For a patient of average weight (about 70 kg) the volume needed will exceed the limit of one syringe.
 One drop of PROLENSA ophthalmic solution should be applied to the affected eye once daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery, and through the first 14 days of the postoperative period.
 Each course of treatment consists of two 5 - day treatment cycles separated by a rest period.
 600,000 International Units / kg (0.037 mg / kg) dose administered every 8 hours by a 15 - minute intravenous infusion for a maximum of 14 doses.
 Following 9 days of rest, the schedule is repeated for another 14 doses, for a maximum of 28 doses per course, as tolerated.
 Metastatic melanoma patients received a median of 18 doses during the first course of therapy.
 The recommended dose of Prolia is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months.
 All patients should receive calcium 1000 mg daily and at least 400 IU vitamin D daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 This generally takes 15 to 30 minutes.
 For administration of Prolia from the single - use vial, use a 27 - gauge needle to withdraw and inject the 1 mL dose.
 Depending on the severity and duration of symptoms, total daily dosage for adult psychotic patients may range initially from 2.5 to 10.0 mg and should be divided and given at six - to eight - hour intervals.
 Therapeutic effect is often achieved with doses under 20 mg daily.
 Daily doses up to 40 mg may be necessary; controlled clinical studies have not been performed to demonstrate safety of prolonged administration of such doses.
 When symptoms are controlled, dosage can generally be reduced gradually to daily maintenance doses of 1.0 or 5.0 mg, often given as a single daily dose.
 For geriatric patients, the suggested starting dose is 1.0 to 2.5 mg daily, adjusted according to the response of the patient.
 Use the lowest dose of PROMACTA to achieve and maintain a platelet count greater than or equal to 50 x 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding.
 Initiate PROMACTA at a dose of 50 mg once daily, except in patients who are of East Asian ancestry (such as Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, or Korean) or who have mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class A, B, C).
 For patients of East Asian ancestry with ITP, initiate PROMACTA at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 For patients with ITP and mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class A, B, C), initiate PROMACTA at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 For patients of East Asian ancestry with ITP and hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class A, B, C), consider initiating PROMACTA at a reduced dose of 12.5 mg once daily [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Initiate PROMACTA at a dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 After initiating PROMACTA, adjust the dose to achieve and maintain a platelet count greater than or equal to 50 x 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding.
 Do not exceed a dose of 75 mg daily.
 Do not administer more than one dose of PROMACTA within any 24 - hour period.
 Discontinue PROMACTA if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks of therapy with PROMACTA at the maximum daily dose of 75 mg.
 Initiate PROMACTA at a dose of 25 mg once daily.
 Do not exceed a dose of 100 mg daily.
 Hematologic response requires dose titration, generally up to 150 mg, and may take up to 16 weeks after starting PROMACTA [see Clinical Studies].
 Initiate PROMACTA at a dose of 50 mg once daily.
 For patients with severe aplastic anemia of East Asian ancestry or those with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class A, B, C), initiate PROMACTA at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

 Do not exceed a dose of 150 mg daily.
 The average oral dose is 25 mg taken before retiring; however, 12.5 mg may be taken before meals and on retiring, if necessary.
 Single 25 - mg doses at bedtime or 6.25 to 12.5 mg taken three times daily will usually suffice.
 The average adult dose is 25 mg taken twice daily.
 On succeeding days of travel, it is recommended that 25 mg be given on arising and again before the evening meal.
 For children, promethazine hydrochloride tablets, syrup, or rectal suppositories, 12.5 to 25 mg twice daily, may be administered.
 The average effective dose of promethazine hydrochloride for the active therapy of nausea and vomiting in children or adults is 25 mg.
 For nausea and vomiting in children, the usual dose is 0.5 mg per pound of body weight, and the dose should be adjusted to the age and weight of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated.
 For prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, as during surgery and the postoperative period, the average dose is 25 mg repeated at 4 - to 6 - hour intervals, as necessary.
 Administration of 12.5 to 25 mg promethazine hydrochloride by the oral route or by rectal suppository at bedtime will provide sedation in children.

 PROPLEX T, Factor IX Complex, Heat Treated should be infused slowly, at a rate of approximately two to three mL per minute.
 An adequate interval (3 to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects.
 Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and / or by increasing the infusion rate of propofol injectable emulsion.
 Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg / kg / min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery time.
 Morphine premedication (0.15 mg / kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non - narcotic (lorazepam) premedication.
 Most adult patients under 55 years of age and classified as ASA - PS I or II require 2 to 2.5 mg / kg of propofol injectable emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids.
 For induction, propofol injectable emulsion should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10 seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia.
 Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 to 1.5 mg / kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of propofol injectable emulsion for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses.
 Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA - PS I or II require 2.5 to 3.5 mg / kg of propofol injectable emulsion for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids.
 Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10 seconds.
 Slower boluses or infusions of propofol injectable emulsion for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 to 2 mg / kg).
 Morphine premedication (0.15 mg / kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injectable emulsion maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non - narcotic (lorazepam) premedication.
 A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 to 1.5 mg / kg) should be used.
 Propofol injectable emulsion 100 to 200 mcg / kg / min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery.
 During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 to 200 mcg / kg / min) for the first 10 to 15 minutes.
 Generally, rates of 50 to 100 mcg / kg / min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times.
 Increments of propofol injectable emulsion 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) may be administered with nitrous oxide in adult patients undergoing general surgery.
 In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of propofol injectable emulsion at a rate of 200 to 300 mcg / kg / min should immediately follow the induction dose.
 Following the first halfhour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 to 150 mcg / kg / min are typically needed.
 In most patients, the rates of propofol injectable emulsion administration will be in the range of 25 to 75 mcg / kg / min.
 In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA - PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation.
 With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing propofol injectable emulsion at 100 to 150 mcg / kg / min (6 to 9 mg / kg / h) for a period of 3 to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function.
 With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg / kg administered over 3 to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses.
 In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA - PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation.
 With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 to 75 mcg / kg / min (1.5 to 4.5 mg / kg / h) during the first 10 to 15 minutes of sedation maintenance.
 Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 to 50 mcg / kg / min and adjusted to clinical responses.
 If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of propofol injectable emulsion 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect.
 In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA - PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation.
 Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg / kg / min (0.3 to 3 mg / kg / h) individualized and titrated to clinical response.
 With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg / kg / min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation.
 When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg / kg / min (0.3 mg / kg / h).
 The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 to 10 mcg / kg / min (0.3 to 0.6 mg / kg / h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved.
 Most adult patients require maintenance rates of 5 to 50 mcg / kg / min (0.3 to 3 mg / kg / h) or higher.
 Bolus administration of 10 or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur.
 If lidocaine is to be administered to minimize pain on injection of propofol, it is recommended that it be administered prior to propofol administration or that it be added to propofol immediately before administration and in quantities not exceeding 20 mg lidocaine / 200 mg propofol.
 Propofol injectable emulsion should only be administered through a filter with a pore size of 5 micron or greater unless it has been demonstrated that the filter does not restrict the flow of propofol injectable emulsion and / or cause the breakdown of the emulsion.
 The usual dose is 1 to 3 mg administered under careful monitoring, such as electrocardiography and central venous pressure.
 The rate of administration should not exceed 1 mg (1 mL) per minute to diminish the possibility of lowering blood pressure and causing cardiac standstill.

 The preferred route of administration for PROSTIN VR PEDIATRIC Sterile Solution is continuous intravenous infusion into a large vein.
 Begin infusion with 0.05 to 0.1 micrograms alprostadil per kilogram of body weight per minute.
 A starting dose of 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute is the recommended starting dose based on clinical studies; however, adequate clinical response has been reported using a starting dose of 0.05 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute.
 This may be accomplished by reducing the dosage from 0.1 to 0.05 to 0.025 to 0.01 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute.
 If response to 0.05 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute is inadequate, dosage can be increased up to 0.4 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per minute although, in general, higher infusion rates do not produce greater effects.
 To prepare infusion solutions, dilute 1 mL of PROSTIN VR PEDIATRIC Sterile Solution with Sodium Chloride Injection USP or Dextrose Injection USP.

 The dose of radioactivity to be administered and the patient should be verified before administering QUADRAMET® (samarium sm 153 lexidronam) .
 administration) a minimum of 500 mL (2 cups) of fluids prior to injection and should void as often as possible after injection to minimize radiation exposure to the bladder.
 QUADRAMET® (samarium sm 153 lexidronam) contains calcium and may be incompatible with solutions that contain molecules that can complex with and form calcium precipitates.
 QUADRAMET® (samarium sm 153 lexidronam) should not be diluted or mixed with other solutions.
 injection of QUADRAMET® (samarium sm 153 lexidronam) are shown in Table 7.
 Radiation dose estimates for bone and marrow assume that radioactivity is deposited on bone surfaces, as noted in autoradiograms of biopsy bone samples in 7 patients who received QUADRAMET® (samarium sm 153 lexidronam) .
 Although electron emissions from 153Sm are abundant, with energies up to 810 keV, rapid blood clearance of QUADRAMET® (samarium sm 153 lexidronam) and low energy and abundant photon emissions generally result in low radiation doses to those parts of the body where the complex does not localize.
 For treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in adults: Orally, 648 mg (two capsules) every 8 hours for 7 days [see Clinical Studies].
 In patients with acute uncomplicated malaria and severe chronic renal impairment, the following dosage regimen is recommended: one loading dose of 648 mg QUALAQUIN followed 12 hours later by maintenance doses of 324 mg every 12 hours.
 The recommended dose for topiramate monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg orally once daily.
 The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures or Lennox - Gastaut Syndrome is 200 mg to 400 mg orally once daily.
 The recommended total dose for adults with primary generalized tonic - clonic seizures is 400 mg orally once daily.
 Initiate therapy at 25 mg to 50 mg once daily followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg every week.
 Daily topiramate doses above 1,600 mg have not been studied.
 The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients with partial onset seizures, primary generalized tonic - clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox - Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 mg / kg to 9 mg / kg orally once daily.
 Begin titration at 25 mg once daily (based on a range of 1 mg / kg / day to 3 mg / kg / day) given nightly for the first week.
 Subsequently, increase the dosage at 1 or 2 week intervals by increments of 1 mg / kg to 3 mg / kg to achieve optimal clinical response.
 In the study of primary generalized tonic - clonic seizures, the assigned dose of 6 mg / kg once daily was reached at the end of 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies].
 The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg / kg Quelicin (succinylcholine chloride) Injection given intravenously.
 The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg / kg for adults.
 A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS).
 The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute.
 Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion.
 The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation.
 This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation.
 An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg / kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg / kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required.
 For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg / kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg / kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).
 For example, the usual adult IV dose of 0.6 mg / kg is comparable to a dose of 2 - 3 mg / kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1 - 2 mg / kg in infants up to 2 years of age.
 Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg / kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure.
 A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg / kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route.
 Admixtures containing 1 to 2 mg / mL may be prepared by adding 1 g Quelicin to 1000 or 500 mL sterile solution, such as 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 The recommended starting adult dose for all QUESTRAN powdered products (QUESTRAN Powder and QUESTRAN Light) is one packet or one level scoopful once or twice a day.

 Therapy with Quinidex should begin with one tablet (300 mg; 249 mg of quinidine base) every eight to twelve hours.
 In one reported regimen, the patient first receives two tablets (648 mg; 403 mg of quinidine base) of quinidine gluconate every eight hours.
 If this regimen has not resulted in conversion after 3 or 4 doses, then the dose is cautiously increased.
 In another regimen sometimes used, the patient receives one tablet (324 mg; 202 mg of quinidine base) every eight hours for two days; then two tablets every twelve hours for two days; and finally two tablets every eight hours for up to four days.
 Therapy with quinidine gluconate should begin with one tablet (324 mg; 202 mg of quinidine base) every eight or twelve hours.
 Two regimens have each been shown to be effective, with or without concomitant exchange transfusion.
 In Regimen A, each patient received a loading dose of 15 mg / kg of quinidine base (that is, 24 mg / kg of quinidine gluconate (quinidine gluconate (quinidine gluconate injection) injection) ) in 250 mL of normal saline infused over 4 hours.
 Thereafter, each patient received a maintenance regimen of 7.5 mg / kg of base (12 mg / kg of quinidine gluconate (quinidine gluconate (quinidine gluconate injection) injection) ) infused over 4 hours every 8 hours, starting 8 hours after the beginning of the loading dose.
 This regimen was continued for 7 days, except that in patients able to swallow, the maintenance infusions were discontinued, and approximately the same daily doses of quinidine were supplied orally, using 300 – mg tablets of quinidine sulfate.
 In Regimen B, each patient received a loading dose of 6.25 mg / kg of quinidine base (that is, 10 mg / kg of quinidine gluconate (quinidine gluconate (quinidine gluconate injection) injection) ) in approximately 5 mL / kg of normal saline over 1 – 2 hours.
 Thereafter,each patient received a maintenance infusion of 12.5 mg / kg / min of base (that is, 20 mg / kg / min of quinidine gluconate).
 In patients able to swallow, the maintenance infusion was discontinued, and eight – hourly oral quinine sulfate was administered to provide approximately as much daily quinine base as the patient had been receiving quinidine base (for example, each adult patient received 650 mg of quinine sulfate every eight hours).
 After completion of quinidine / quinine therapy, adults able to swallow received a single 1500 – mg / 75 – mg dose of sulfadoxine / pyrimethamine (FANSIDAR®, Roche Laboratories) or a seven – day course of tetracycline (250 mg four times daily), while those unable to swallow received seven – day courses of intravenous doxycycline hyclate (VIBRAMYCIN®, Roerig), 100 mg twice daily.
 To prepare quinidine for infusion, the contents of the supplied vial (80 mg / mL) should be diluted to 50 mL (16 mg / mL) with 5% dextrose.
 In one study (Am J Health Syst Pharm.
 1996; 53:655 – 8), use of 112 inches of tubing resulted in 30% loss of quinidine, but drug loss was less than 3% when only 12 inches of tubing was used.
 Most arrhythmias that will respond to intravenous quinidine will respond to a total dose of less than 5 mg / kg, but some patients may require as much as 10 mg / kg.
 If conversion to sinus rhythm has not been achieved after infusion of 10 mg / kg, then the infusion should be discontinued, and other means of conversion (eg, direct – currentcardioversion) should be considered.
 Therapy with quinidine sulfate (quinidine sulfate (quinidine sulfate (quinidine sulfate tablet, film coated, extended release) tablet, film coated, extended release) tablet, film coated, extended release) should begin with one tablet (300 mg; 249 mg of quinidine base) every 8 to 12 hours.

 Instill one to two drops in the affected eye(s) every 4 hours while awake, up to 4 times per day.
 The recommended dose of Qutenza is a single, 60 - minute application of up to four patches.
 Apply topical anesthetic to the entire treatment area and surrounding 1 to 2 cm, and keep the local anesthetic in place until the skin is anesthetized prior to the application of Qutenza patch.
 While you slowly peel back the release liner from under the patch with one hand, use your other hand to smooth the patch down on to the skin.
 Consistent dose delivery is achieved, whether using the 40 or 80 mcg strengths, due to proportionality of the 2 products (i.e., 2 actuations of 40 mcg strength should provide a dose comparable to 1 actuation of the 80 mcg strength).
 When the dose counter reaches 20, the color of the numbers will change to red to remind the patient to contact their pharmacist for a refill of medication or consult their physician for a prescription refill.
 Discard QVAR inhaler when the dose counter displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comesfirst.

 Give 20 IU / kg body weight.
 The recommended dosage of HRIG should not exceed 20 IU / kg body weight because it may otherwise interfere with active antibody production.
 When rabies exposure occurs in a previously vaccinated person, then that person should receive two IM (deltoid) doses (1.0 mL each) of RabAvert: one immediately and one 3 days later.
 If the immune status of a previously vaccinated person is not known, full postexposure antirabies treatment (HRIG plus 5 doses of vaccine) is recommended.
 In such cases, if a protective titer can be demonstrated in a serum sample collected before vaccine is given, treatment can be discontinued after at least two doses of vaccine.
 The package contains a vial of freeze - dried vaccine, a syringe containing 1 mL of sterile diluent, a sterile needle for reconstitution and a sterile needle suitable for intramuscular injection.
 Insert the needle at a 45° angle and slowly inject the entire contents of the diluent (1 mL) into the vaccine vial.

 The recommended dose of Prussian blue insoluble is 3 grams orally three times a day.
 The recommended dose of Prussian blue insoluble is 1 gram orally three times a day.
 When the internal radioactivity is substantially decreased, the Prussian blue insoluble dose may be decreased to 1 or 2 grams TID to improve gastrointestinal tolerance.
 One RAGWITEK tablet daily.
 Initiate RANEXA dosing at 500 mg twice daily and increase to 1000 mg twice daily, as needed, based on clinical symptoms.
 The maximum recommended daily dose of RANEXA is 1000 mg twice daily.
 Limit the maximum dose of RANEXA to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as diltiazem, verapamil, and erythromycin.
 The recommended dose is 8 mg orally once daily with a meal.
 RAPAFLO is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr < 30 mL / min).
 In patients with moderate renal impairment (CCr 30 - 50 mL / min), the dose should be reduced to 4 mg once daily taken with a meal.
 A loading dose should be considered in addition to a new maintenance dose when it is necessary to increase sirolimus trough concentrations: Rapamune loading dose = 3 × (new maintenance dose - current maintenance dose).
 The maximum Rapamune dose administered on any day should not exceed 40 mg.
 If an estimated daily dose exceeds 40 mg due to the addition of a loading dose, the loading dose should be administered over 2 days.
 Two milligrams (2 mg) of Rapamune Oral Solution have been demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to 2 mg Rapamune Tablets; hence, are interchangeable on a mg - to - mg basis.
 a daily maintenance dose of 2 mg should be preceded with a loading dose of 6 mg.
 For patients receiving Rapamune with cyclosporine, Rapamune therapy should be initiated with a loading dose of up to 15 mg on day 1 post - transplantation.
 Beginning on day 2, an initial maintenance dose of 5 mg / day should be given.
 The starting dose of cyclosporine should be up to 7 mg / kg / day in divided doses and the dose should subsequently be adjusted to achieve target whole blood trough concentrations [see Therapeutic Drug Monitoring].
 Prednisone should be administered at a minimum of 5 mg / day.
 For patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the initial Rapamune dose should be 2 mg / day.
 Sirolimus whole blood trough concentrations should be measured in 10 – 20 days, with dosage adjustment to maintain concentrations between 5 – 15 ng / mL [see Therapeutic Drug Monitoring].
 Following cyclosporine withdrawal in transplant patients at low - to moderate - immunologic risk, the target sirolimus trough concentrations should be 16 to 24 ng / mL for the first year following transplantation.
 Thereafter, the target sirolimus concentrations should be 12 to 20 ng / mL.
 The initial dosage in patients ≥ 13 years who weigh less than 40 kg should be adjusted, based on body surface area, to 1 mg / m / day.
 It is recommended that the maintenance dose of Rapamune be reduced by approximately one third in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and by approximately one half in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
 Empty the correct amount of Rapamune from the syringe into only a glass or plastic container holding at least two (2) ounces (1 / 4 cup, 60 mL) of water or orange juice.
 Refill the container with an additional volume [minimum of four (4) ounces (1 / 2 cup, 120 mL)] of water or orange juice, stir vigorously, and drink at once.
 The recommended dose of RAPIVAB in adult patients 18 years of age or older with acute uncomplicated influenza is a single 600 mg dose, administered via intravenous infusion for 15 to 30 minutes.

 Once a diluted solution of RAPIVAB has been prepared, administer immediately or store under refrigerated conditions (2° to 8°C or 36° to 46°F) for up to 24 hours.
 The maximum total dose of Raplixa per surgery is 3 grams.
 In clinical trials, it was demonstrated that smaller bleeding sites covering an area of less than 10 cm² used 0.5 gram to 1.0 gram of Raplixa.
 Larger bleeding sites covering an area of 10 - 100 cm² used 1.0 to 2.0 grams of Raplixa to stop bleeding.
 Table 1: Guideline for Raplixa Application
 The recommended initial dose of RAPLON (rapacuronium) TM (rapauronium bromide) for injection in adult and geriatric patients is 1.5 mg / kg for short surgical procedures.
 In US and European studies, acceptable intubation scores were present in at lease 85% of patients within 60 seconds after administration of 1.5 mg / kg of RAPLON (rapacuronium) TM.
 In patients undergoing Cesarean section, the recommended RAPLON (rapacuronium) TM intubating dose, with thiopental induction, is 2.5 mg / kg.
 Repeat Dosing in Adults (Bolus) Following an intubating dose of 1.5 mg / kg.
 Up to three maintenance doses of 0.50 mg / kg of RAPLON (rapacuronium bromide) for injection, administered at 25% recovery of control T1 provided a mean clinical duration of 12 † 16 minutes under opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia.
 Initial doses of RAPLON (rapacuronium) TM of 2 mg / kg intravenously in pediatric patients (ages 1 month to 12 years) under halothane anesthesia produced acceptable intubating conditions within 60 seconds.
 The adult (1.5 mg / kg), pediatric (2.0 mg / kg), and Cesarean Section (2.5 mg / kg) dosing recommendations may serve as a general guideline in determining an intubating dose in this age group.
 The clinical duration of RAPLONTM (rapacuronium bromide) for injection is not prolonged in geriatric patients at a dose of 1.5 mg / kg.
 The recommended dose of RAPTIVA (efalizumab) is a single 0.7 mg / kg SC conditioning dose followed by weekly SC doses of 1 mg / kg (maximum single dose not to exceed a total of 200 mg).
 Remove the plastic cap protecting the rubber stopper of the RAPTIVA (efalizumab) vial and wipe the top of the rubber stopper with one of the provided alcohol swabs.
 To prepare the RAPTIVA (efalizumab) solution, using the provided pre - filled diluent syringe slowly inject the 1.3 mL of sterile water for injection (non - USP) into the RAPTIVA (efalizumab) vial.
 Rasuvo is only available in doses between 7.5 to 30 mg in 2.5 mg increments.
 Use another formulation of methotrexate for alternative dosing in patients who require oral, intramuscular, intravenous, intra - arterial, or intrathecal dosing, doses less than 7.5 mg per week, doses more than 30 mg per week, high - dose regimens, or dose adjustments of less than 2.5 mg increments.
 Adult RA: 7.5 mg as a single oral or subcutaneous dose once weekly.
 pJIA: 10 mg / m² once weekly.
 Experience does suggest, however, that children receiving 20 to 30 mg / m² / wk (0.65 to 1.0 mg / kg / wk) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.
 Psoriasis: 10 - 25 mg as a single oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous dose once weekly.
 It is advisable to determine an appropriate fixed day of the week for the injection.
 For intravenous - drip use, prepare a 1:1 to 1:10 dilution of reconstituted Antivenin in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.
 Allow the initial 5 to 10 mL to infuse over a 3 - to 5 - minute period, with careful observation of the patient for evidence of untoward reaction.
 minimal envenomation – 20 - 40 mL (contents of 2 to 4 vials).
 moderate envenomation – 50 - 90 mL (contents of 5 to 9 vials).
 If swelling continues to progress or if systemic symptoms or signs of envenomation increase in severity or if new manifestations appear, for example, fall in hematocrit or hypotension, administer an additional 10 to 50 mL (contents of 1 to 5 vials) or more intravenously.
 For severe envenomation, a total of 200 to 400 mL (contents of 20 to 40 vials) may be necessary.10,19,20,21,22 There is not a recommended maximum dose.
 Prompt surgical consultation is indicated whenever a closed - compartment syndrome is suspected.3,4,25
 With a sterile 10 mL syringe and needle, withdraw the diluent (Sterile Water for Injection, USP) from the vial of diluent and insert the needle through the stopper of the vacuum - containing vial of Antivenin.
 However, delivery of 10 mL of diluent may not always exhaust the vacuum in the Antivenin vial.
 Therefore, either disconnect the needle from the syringe and allow room air to be pulled into the Antivenin vial until all vacuum is released from the container or withdraw the syringe with attached needle from the vial, pull 10 mL of room air into the syringe and reinsert needle with attached syringe containing room air through stopper and repeat, if necessary, to release any remaining vacuum.
 Total daily dosage of RAVICTI (mL) = total daily dosage of sodium phenylbutyrate (g) x 0.86
 The recommended dosage range, based upon body surface area, in patients naïve to phenylbutyrate (PBA) is 4.5 to 11.2 mL / m² / day (5 to 12.4 g / m² / day).
 For patients with some residual enzyme activity who are not adequately controlled with protein restriction, the recommended starting dosage is 4.5 mL / m² / day.
 Given that approximately 47% of dietary nitrogen is excreted as waste and approximately 70% of an administered PBA dose will be converted to urinary phenylacetylglutamine (U - PAGN), an initial estimated RAVICTI dose for a 24 - hour period is 0.6 mL RAVICTI per gram of dietary protein ingested per 24 - hour period.
 The total daily dosage should not exceed 17.5 mL.
 Each gram of U - PAGN excreted over 24 hours covers waste nitrogen generated from 1.4 grams of dietary protein.
 The amount of dose adjustment should factor in the amount of dietary protein that has not been covered, as indicated by the 24 - h U - PAGN level and the estimated RAVICTI dose needed per gram of dietary protein ingested and the maximum total daily dosage (i.e., 17.5 mL).
 The usual dose for RAXAR (grepafloxacin) is 400 mg or 600 mg orally every 24 hours as described in Table 5.
 Administer raxibacumab as a single dose of 40 mg / kg intravenously over 2 hours and 15 minutes after dilution in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) to a final volume of 250 mL.
 Administer 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine within 1 hour prior to raxibacumab infusion to reduce the risk of infusion reactions.
 The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are derived from simulations designed to match the observed adult exposure to raxibacumab at a 40 mg / kg dose.
 The recommended dose of raxibacumab is weight - based, given as an intravenous infusion after dilution in a compatible solution to a final volume of 250 mL (adults and children 50 kg or heavier) or to a volume indicated based on the child's weight (Table 2).
 Calculate the required volume in milliliters of raxibacumab injection needed for the dose by dividing the calculated dose in milligrams (step 1) by the concentration, 50 mg / mL.
 Each single - use vial allows delivery of 34 mL raxibacumab.
 The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am and is minimal between 4 pm and midnight.
 The initial dosage of RAYOS may vary from 5 to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 For the purpose of comparison, one 5 mg RAYOS tablet is the equivalent milligram dosage of the following various corticosteroids:
 The recommended starting dosage of RAZADYNE® ER is 8 mg / day.
 The dosage should be increased to the initial maintenance dose of 16 mg / day after a minimum of 4 weeks.
 A further increase to 24 mg / day should be attempted after a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg / day.
 The dosage of RAZADYNE® ER shown to be effective in a controlled clinical trial is 16 - 24 mg / day.
 The dosage of RAZADYNE® tablets shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials is 16 - 32 mg / day given as twice daily dosing.
 As the dosage of 32 mg / day is less well tolerated than lower dosages and does not provide increased effectiveness, the recommended dosage range is 16 - 24 mg / day given twice daily.
 The dosage of 24 mg / day did not provide a statistically significant greater clinical benefit than 16 mg / day.
 It is possible, however, that a daily dosage of 24 mg of RAZADYNE® might provide additional benefit for some patients.
 The recommended starting dosage of RAZADYNE® tablets and oral solution is 4 mg twice a day (8 mg / day).
 The dosage should be increased to the initial maintenance dosage of 8 mg twice a day (16 mg / day) after a minimum of 4 weeks.
 A further increase to 12 mg twice a day (24 mg / day) should be attempted after a minimum of 4 weeks at 8 mg twice a day (16 mg / day).
 In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh score of 7 - 9), the dosage should generally not exceed 16 mg / day.
 In patients with creatinine clearance of 9 to 59 mL / min, the dosage should generally not exceed 16 mg / day.
 The recommended dose of PegIntron is 1.5 mcg / kg / week subcutaneously in combination with 800 to 1400 mg REBETOL capsules orally based on patient body weight (see Table 1).
 The treatment duration for patients with genotype 1 is 48 weeks.
 Patients with genotype 2 and 3 should be treated for 24 weeks.
 The treatment duration for patients who previously failed therapy is 48 weeks, regardless of HCV genotype.
 The recommended dose of PegIntron is 60 mcg / m² / week subcutaneously in combination with 15 mg / kg / day of REBETOL orally in two divided doses (see Table 2) for pediatric patients ages 3 - 17 years.
 The treatment duration for patients with genotype 1 is 48 weeks.
 Patients with genotype 2 and 3 should be treated for 24 weeks.
 The recommended dose of REBETOL is 15 mg / kg per day orally (divided dose AM and PM).
 Refer to Table 2 for Pediatric Dosing of REBETOL in combination with INTRON A. INTRON A for Injection by body weight of 25 kg to 61 kg is 3 million IU / m² three times weekly subcutaneously.
 The recommended duration of treatment is 48 weeks for pediatric patients with genotype 1.
 Dose reduction of PegIntron in adult patients on REBETOL / PegIntron combination therapy is accomplished in a two - step process from the original starting dose of 1.5 mcg / kg / week, to 1 mcg / kg / week, then to 0.5 mcg / kg / week, if needed.
 In the adult combination therapy Study 2, dose reductions occurred in 42% of subjects receiving PegIntron 1.5 mcg / kg and REBETOL 800 mg daily, including 57% of those subjects weighing 60 kg or less.
 In Study 4, 16% of subjects had a dose reduction of PegIntron to 1 mcg / kg in combination with REBETOL, with an additional 4% requiring the second dose reduction of PegIntron to 0.5 mcg / kg due to adverse events [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 Dose reduction in pediatric patients is accomplished by modifying the recommended PegIntron dose in a two - step process from the original starting dose of 60 mcg / m² / week, to 40 mcg / m² / week, then to 20 mcg / m² / week, if needed (see Table 4).
 In the pediatric combination therapy trial, dose reductions occurred in 25% of subjects receiving PegIntron 60 mcg / m² weekly and REBETOL 15 mg / kg daily.
 Dose reduction in pediatric patients is accomplished by modifying the recommended REBETOL dose from the original starting dose of 15 mg / kg daily in a two - step process to 12 mg / kg / day, then to 8 mg / kg / day, if needed (see Table 4).
 Patients with impaired renal function and those over the age of 50 should be carefully monitored with respect to development of anemia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 For patients with a history of stable cardiovascular disease, a permanent dose reduction is required if the hemoglobin decreases by greater than or equal to 2 g / dL during any 4 - week period.
 It is recommended that a patient whose hemoglobin level falls below 10 g / dL have his / her REBETOL dose modified or discontinued per Table 4 [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 For patients with a history of stable cardiovascular disease, a permanent dose reduction is required if the hemoglobin decreases by ≥ 2 g / dL during any 4 - week period.
 In addition, for these cardiac history patients, if the hemoglobin remains < 12 g / dL after 4 weeks on a reduced dose, the patient should discontinue combination REBETOL / INTRON A therapy.
 It is recommended that a patient whose hemoglobin level falls below 10 g / dL have his / her REBETOL dose reduced to 600 mg daily (1 x 200 mg capsule AM, 2 x 200 mg capsules PM).
 INTRON A Injection provided in vials is stable at 35°C (95°F) for up to 7 days and at 30°C (86°F) for up to 14 days.
 The recommended dose of REBIF is either 22 mcg or 44 mcg injected subcutaneously three times per week.
 A Titration Pack containing 6 doses of 8.8 mcg (0.2 mL) and 6 doses of 22 mcg (0.5 mL) is available for use during the titration period in both REBIF prefilled syringes and REBIF Rebidose autoinjectors.
 Table 1: Titration Schedule for a 22 mcg Prescribed Dose*

 Recommended minimum treatment time is 60 – 90 days.
 The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
 The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion given once every 2 years intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
 The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
 The recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
 The recommended dose is a 5 mg infusion.
 infusion should be followed by a 10 mL normal saline flush of the intravenous line.
 Reclast solution for infusion must not be allowed to come in contact with any calcium or other divalent cation - containing solutions, and should be administered as a single intravenous solution through a separate vented infusion line.
 (1) A dose of 1750 IU AHF administered to a 70 kg patient, i.e.
 25 IU / kg (1750 / 70), should be expected to cause a peak post - infusion AHF increase of 25 x 2 = 50 IU / dL (50% of normal).
 (2) A peak level of 70% is required in a 40 kg child.
 In this situation the dose would be 70 / 2 x 40 = 1400 IU.
 Preparations of RECOMBINATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) (rAHF) can be administered at a rate of up to 10 mL per minute with no significant reactions.
 Persons from birth through 19 years of age: A series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0 - , 1 - , and 6 - month schedule.
 Adolescents 11 through 15 years of age: A series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0 - , 1 - , and 6 - month schedule or a series of 2 doses (1.0 mL each) on a 0 - and 4 - to 6 - month schedule.

 Assess the need for a booster dose annually by antibody testing, and give a booster dose when the anti - HBs level declines to less than 10 mIU / mL.3
 Apply 1 inch of ointment (375 mg of ointment equivalent to 1.5 mg of nitroglycerin) intra - anally every 12 hours for up to 3 weeks.
 To obtain a 1.5 mg dose of nitroglycerin, the covered finger is laid alongside the 1 inch dosing line on the carton.
 One international unit (IU) of factor VIII activity corresponds approximately to the quantity of factor VIII in one mL of normal human plasma.
 The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon the empirical finding that, on average, 1 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by approximately 2 IU / dL per IU / kg administered.
 Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (IU / dL or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU / kg per IU / dL)
 Pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling, based on pharmacokinetic data from 185 infusions in 102 PTPs, predicts that routine prophylactic dosing 3 times per week may be associated with a lower bleeding risk than with dosing twice weekly.
 In clinical studies in PTPs (ages 8 - 73 years) and PUPs (ages < 1 - 52 months), the mean dose used per infusion for routine prophylaxis was 29 ± 11 IU / kg and 53 ± 22 IU / kg, respectively.
 ReFacto® Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion after reconstitution with the supplied diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Diluent, 4 mL disposable syringe for drug diluent use with ReFacto Antihemophilic Factor [Recombinant]) syringe.
 Note: If you use more than one vial of ReFacto (antihemophilic factor) per infusion, reconstitute each vial as per the previous instructions.
 Note: If you prepared more than one vial of ReFacto (antihemophilic factor) , remove the diluent syringe from the vial adapter, leaving the vial adapter attached to the vial.
 ReFacto® Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) should be administered using the tubing provided in this kit, and the pre - filled diluent syringe provided or a single sterile disposable plastic syringe.

 • 0.4 mg / kg body weight (up to 110kg) slowly intravenously (eg, over 15 to 20seconds) as a bolus dose,
 † followed by 0.15 mg / kg body weight (up to 110kg) / hour as a continuous intravenous infusion for 2 to 10 days or longer if clinically needed.
 Normally the initial dosage depends on the patient's body weight a body weight exceeding 110 kg, the initial dosage should not be increased beyond the 110 kg body weight dose (maximal initial bolus dose of 44 mg, maximal initial infusion dose of 16.5 mg / h; see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Administration; Initial Intravenous Bolus, Table 7 and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Administration; Intravenous Infusion, Table 8).
 A patient baseline aPTT should be determined prior to initiation of therapy with REFLUDAN (lepirudin) , since REFLUDAN (lepirudin) should not be started in patients presenting with a baseline aPTT ratio of 2.5 or more, in order to avoid initial overdosing.
 • The target range for the aPTT ratio during treatment (therapeutic window) should be 1.5 to 2.5.
 • As stated in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Initial Dosage, REFLUDAN (lepirudin) should not be started in patients presenting with a baseline aPTT ratio of 2.5 or more, in order to avoid initial overdosing.
 At restart, the infusion rate should be decreased by 50% (no additional intravenous bolus should be administered).
 In all patients with renal insufficiency, the bolus dose is to be reduced to 0.2 mg / kg body weight.

 Additional intravenous bolus doses of 0.1 mg / kg body weight should be considered every other day only if the aPTT ratio falls below the lower therapeutic limit of 1.5 (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Monitoring and Adjusting Therapy; Standard Recommendations).
 • Initial intravenous bolus: 0.2 mg / kg body weight
 • Continuous intravenous infusion: 0.1 mg / kg body weight / h
 • For rapid, complete reconstitution, inject 1 mL of diluent into the vial and shake it gently.
 For intravenous bolus injection, use a solution with a concentration of 5 mg / mL.
 Preparation of a REFLUDAN (lepirudin) solution with a concentration of 5 mg / mL:
 • Reconstitute one vial (50 mg of lepirudin) with 1mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP.
 • The final concentration of 5 mg / mL is obtained by transferring the contents of the vial into a sterile, single - use syringe (of at least 10 mL capacity) and diluting the solution to a total volume of 10 mL, using Sterile Water for Injection USP, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP or 5% Dextrose Injection.

 Administer from 10 mg to 15 mg reglan® (metoclopramide hydrochloride, USP) orally up to q.i.d.
 If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment.
 Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose.
 Experience with esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using q.i.d.
 For the Relief of Symptoms As s ociated with Diabetic Gas tropares is (Diabetic Gas tric Stas is ) Administer 10 mg of metoclopramide 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well - being upon drug discontinuation.
 Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL / min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one - half the recommended dosage.
 Doses of 10 mg may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1 - to 2 - minute period.
 Intravenous infusions should be made slowly over a period of not less than 15 minutes, 30 minutes before beginning cancer chemotherapy and repeated every 2 hours for two doses, then every 3 hours for three doses.
 The initial two doses should be 2 mg / kg if highly emetogenic drugs such as cisplatin or dacarbazine are used alone or in combination.
 For less emetogenic regimens, 1 mg / kg per dose may be adequate.
 For doses in excess of 10 mg, REGLAN Injection (metoclopramide injection) should be diluted in 50 mL of a parenteral solution.
 If acute dystonic reactions should occur, inject 50 mg Benadryl® (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) intramuscularly, and the symptoms usually will subside.
 The usual adult dose is 10 mg; however, doses of 20 mg may be used.
 If the tube has not passed the pylorus with conventional maneuvers in 10 minutes, a single dose (undiluted) may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1 - to 2 - minute period.
 The recommended single dose is: Pediatric patients above 14 years of age and adults — 10 mg metoclopramide base.
 Pediatric patients (6 - 14 years of age) — 2.5 to 5 mg metoclopramide base; (under 6 years of age) — 0.1 mg / kg metoclopramide base.
 Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL / min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one - half the recommended dosage.
 Administer from 10 mg to 15 mg of REGLAN ODT™ (metoclopramide orally disintegrating tablets) orally up to four times daily, 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime, depending upon symptoms being treated and clinical response [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and INDICATIONS].
 If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment.
 Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose.
 Experience with esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using four times daily therapy at 15 mg / dose, and this regimen should be used when lesions are present, so long as it is tolerated [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 Administer 10 mg of REGLAN ODT™ (metoclopramide orally disintegrating tablets) 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well - being upon drug discontinuation.
 Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL / min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one - half the recommended dosage.
 Reversal doses of REGONOL® range from 0.1 to 0.25 mg / kg.5,10,11,12,13 The onset time to peak effect is dose - dependent; return of twitch height to 90% of control occurs within approximately 6 minutes following administration of a 0.25 mg / kg dose of REGONOL®.5,12 At lower doses, full recovery usually occurs within 15 minutes in most patients, although others may require a half - hour or more.
 When REGONOL® is given intravenously to reverse the action of muscle relaxant drugs, it is recommended that atropine sulfate (0.6 to 1.2 mg) or an equipotent dose of glycopyrrolate be given immediately prior to or simultaneously with the administration of REGONOL®.
 Table 1: Formula to Calculate Length of Gel in Inches to Be Applied Daily
 Using the calculation, each square inch of ulcer surface will require approximately 2 / 3 inch length of gel squeezed from a 15g tube, or approximately 1 1 / 3 inch length of the gel from a 2g tube (physician sample).
 For example, if the ulcer measures 1 inch by 2 inches, then a 1 1 / 4 inch length of gel should be used for 15g tubes (1 × 2 × 0.6 = 1 1 / 4) and 2 3 / 4 inch gel length should be used for a 2g tube (1 × 2 × 1.3 = 2 3 / 4).
 For example, if the ulcer measures 4 cm by 2 cm, then a 2 centimeter length of gel should be used for a 15g tube [(4 × 2) ÷ 4 = 2] and a 4 centimeter length of gel should be used for a 2g tube [(4 × 2) ÷ 2 = 4].
 The weight of REGRANEX Gel from 15g tubes is 0.65g per inch length and 0.25g per centimeter length.
 Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended starting dose is 1,000 mg taken as a single dose with or without food.
 Some patients may obtain more symptomatic relief from 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg per day.
 RELAFEN (nabumetone) can be given in either a single or twice - daily dose.
 Dosages greater than 2,000 mg per day have not been studied.
 Patients weighing under 50 kg may be less likely to require dosages beyond 1,000 mg; therefore, after observing the response to initial therapy, the dose should be adjusted to meet individual patients' requirements.
 The recommended dosage of RELISTOR is 12 mg subcutaneously once daily [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dose of RELISTOR administered subcutaneously is 8 mg for adult patients weighing 38 kg to less than 62 kg and 12 mg for patients weighing 62 kg to 114 kg.
 Adult patients whose weight falls outside of these ranges should be dosed at 0.15 mg / kg.
 The recommended dosage regimen is one dose every other day, as needed [see Clinical Studies].
 See Table 1 to determine the correct dose by patient weight and injection volume to be administered.
 Only adult patients requiring an 8 mg or 12 mg dose should be prescribed pre - filled syringes.
 The maximum recommended single dose is 40 mg.
 In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 20 mg and 40 mg were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults.
 A greater proportion of patients had a response following a 40 mg dose than following a 20 mg dose [see Clinical Studies].
 The maximum daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.
 The recommended starting dose for REMERON (mirtazapine) Tablets is 15 mg / day, administered in a single dose, preferably in the evening prior to sleep.
 In the controlled clinical trials establishing the efficacy of REMERON in the treatment of major depressive disorder, the effective dose range was generally 15 to 45 mg / day.
 While the relationship between dose and satisfactory response in the treatment of major depressive disorder for REMERON has not been adequately explored, patients not responding to the initial 15 - mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 45 mg / day.
 Systematic evaluation of REMERON (mirtazapine) Tablets has demonstrated that its efficacy in major depressive disorder is maintained for periods of up to 40 weeks following 8 to 12 weeks of initial treatment at a dose of 15 to 45 mg / day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with REMERON is unclear.
 The recommended starting dose for REMERONSolTab® (mirtazapine) Orally Disintegrating Tablets is 15 mg / day, administered in a single dose, preferably in the evening prior to sleep.
 While the relationship between dose and satisfactory response in the treatment of major depressive disorder for REMERON® has not been adequately explored, patients not responding to the initial 15 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 45 mg / day.
 The recommended dose of REMICADE is 5 mg / kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg / kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease or fistulizing Crohn's disease.

 If this initial dose cannot be tolerated because of systemic effects, reduce the infusion rate to 0.625 ng / kg / min.
 The infusion rate should be increased in increments of 1.25 ng / kg / min per week for the first four weeks of treatment and then 2.5 ng / kg / min per week for the remaining duration of infusion, depending on clinical response.
 In patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency, decrease the initial dose of Remodulin to 0.625 ng / kg / min ideal body weight.
 The ambulatory infusion pump used to administer Remodulin should: (1) be small and lightweight, (2) be adjustable to approximately 0.002 mL / hr, (3) have occlusion / no delivery, low battery, programming error and motor malfunction alarms, (4) have delivery accuracy of ±6% or better and (5) be positive pressure driven.
 During use, a single reservoir (syringe) of undiluted Remodulin can be administered up to 72 hours at 37°C.
 For a 60 kg person at the recommended initial dose of 1.25 ng / kg / min using the 1 mg / mL Remodulin, the infusion rate would be calculated as follows:
 For a 65 kg person at a dose of 40 ng / kg / min using the 5 mg / mL Remodulin, the infusion rate would be calculated as follows:
 The ambulatory infusion pump used to administer Remodulin should: (1) be small and lightweight, (2) have occlusion / no delivery, low battery, programming error and motor malfunction alarms, (3) have delivery accuracy of ±6% or better of the hourly dose, and (4) be positive pressure driven.
 Diluted Remodulin has been shown to be stable at ambient temperature when stored for up to 14 days using high - pH glycine diluent at concentrations as low as 0.004 mg / mL (4,000 ng / mL).
 Typical intravenous infusion system reservoirs have volumes of 50 or 100 mL.
 Step 1
 Step 2
 For a 60 kg person at a dose of 5 ng / kg / min, with a predetermined intravenous infusion rate of 1 mL / hr and a reservoir of 50 mL, the diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration would be calculated as follows:
 Step 1
 The volume of Remodulin Injection (using 1 mg / mL Vial Strength) needed for a total diluted Remodulin concentration of 0.018 mg / mL and a total volume of 50 mL would be calculated as follows:
 Step 2
 The diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration for the person in Example 3 would thus be prepared by adding 0.9 mL of 1 mg / mL Remodulin Injection to a suitable reservoir along with a sufficient volume of diluent to achieve a total volume of 50 mL in the reservoir.
 For a 75 kg person at a dose of 30 ng / kg / min, with a predetermined intravenous infusion rate of 2 mL / hr, and a reservoir of 100 mL, the diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration would be calculated as follows:
 Step 1
 The volume of Remodulin Injection (using 2.5 mg / mL Vial Strength) needed for a total diluted Remodulin concentration of 0.0675 mg / mL and a total volume of 100 mL would be calculated as follows:
 Step 2
 The diluted intravenous Remodulin concentration for the person in Example 4 would thus be prepared by adding 2.7 mL of 2.5 mg / mL Remodulin Injection to a suitable reservoir along with a sufficient volume of diluent to achieve a total volume of 100 mL in the reservoir.
 Initiate Remodulin at a recommended dose of 10% of the current Flolan dose, and then escalate as the Flolan dose is decreased (see Table 2 for recommended dose titrations).

 After 2 days, if necessary, the dose can be increased to 0.5 mg once daily, and to 1 mg once daily at the end of the first week of dosing, then as shown in Table 2 as needed to achieve efficacy.
 Titration should be based on individual patient therapeutic response and tolerability, up to a maximum recommended dose of 4 mg daily.
 For RLS, the safety and effectiveness of doses greater than 4 mg once daily have not been established.
 In clinical trials of patients treated for RLS with doses up to 4 mg once daily, REQUIP was discontinued without a taper.
 No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 mL / min).
 The recommended initial dose of ropinirole for patients with endstage renal disease on hemodialysis is 0.25 mg once daily.
 The recommended maximum total daily dose is 3 mg / day in patients receiving regular dialysis.
 The recommended starting dose of REQUIP XL is 2 mg taken once daily for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by increases of 2 mg / day at weekly or longer intervals, based on therapeutic response and tolerability.
 In fixed - dose studies designed to characterize the dose - response to REQUIP XL, there was no additional therapeutic benefit shown in patients with advanced stage Parkinson's disease taking daily doses greater than 8 mg / day, or with early stage Parkinson's disease taking doses greater than 12 mg / day [see Clinical Studies].
 Although the maximum recommended dose of REQUIP XL is 24 mg, patients with advanced Parkinson's disease should generally be maintained at daily doses of 8 mg or lower and patients with early Parkinson's disease should generally be maintained at daily doses 12 mg or lower.

 The recommended dosage for RESCRIPTOR Tablets is 400 mg (four 100 - mg or two 200 - mg tablets) 3 times daily.
 The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily.
 If two drugs are used, they should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
 Instill one drop of RESTASIS® ophthalmic emulsion twice a day in each eye approximately 12 hours apart.
 While the recommended usual adult dose is 15 mg before retiring, 7.5 mg may be sufficient for some patients, and others may need 30 mg.
 In transient insomnia, a 7.5 mg dose may be sufficient to improve sleep latency.
 In elderly or debilitated patients, it is recommended that therapy be initiated with 7.5 mg until individual responses are determined.
 Based on U.S. clinical studies, the maximum recommended dose per treatment is 1.5 mL per lip per treatment or 1.0 mL for perioral rhytid correction.
 Dissection of the sub - epidermal plane with lateral movement of the needle, rapid flows ( > 0.3 mL / min), rapid injection or high volumes may result in an increase in short - term episodes of bruising, swelling, redness, pain, or tenderness at the injection site.
 Retavase® is administered as a 10 + 10 unit double - bolus injection.
 Two 10 unit bolus injections are required for a complete treatment.

 RETISERT (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.59 mg is implanted into the posterior segment of the affected eye through a pars plana incision.
 The implant contains one tablet of 0.59 mg of fluocinolone acetonide.
 RETISERT is designed to release fluocinolone acetonide at a nominal initial rate of 0.6 μg / day, decreasing over the first month to a steady state between 0.3 - 0.4 μg / day over approximately 30 months.
 Care should be taken during implantation and explantation to avoid sheer forces on the implant that could disengage the silicone cup reservoir (which contains a fluocinolone acetonide tablet) from the suture tab.
 The recommended oral dose of RETROVIR is 300 mg twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
 The recommended intravenous dose is 1 mg per kg infused at a constant rate over 1 hour every 4 hours.
 The recommended oral dose of RETROVIR is 480 mg per m² per day in divided doses (240 mg per m² twice daily or 160 mg per m² three times daily).
 100 mg orally 5 times per day until the start of labor [see Clinical Studies].
 During labor and delivery, intravenous RETROVIR should be administered at 2 mg per kg (total body weight) over 1 hour followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 1 mg per kg per hour (total body weight) until clamping of the umbilical cord.
 Significant anemia (hemoglobin less than 7.5 g per dL or reduction greater than 25% of baseline) and / or significant neutropenia (granulocyte count less than 750 cells per mm³ or reduction greater than 50% from baseline) may require a dose interruption until evidence of marrow recovery is observed [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 In patients maintained on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or with creatinine clearance (CrCl) by Cockcroft - Gault less than 15 mL per min, the recommended oral dosage is 100 mg every 6 to 8 hours.
 The intravenous dosing regimen equivalent to the oral administration of 100 mg every 6 to 8 hours is approximately 1 mg per kg every 6 to 8 hours [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Adults: The recommended intravenous dose is 1 mg / kg infused over 1 hour.
 This dose should be administered 5 to 6 times daily (5 to 6 mg / kg daily).
 The intravenous dosing regimen equivalent to the oral administration of 100 mg every 4 hours is approximately 1 mg / kg intravenously every 4 hours.
 Maternal Dosing: 100 mg orally 5 times per day until the start of labor.
 During labor and delivery, intravenous RETROVIR should be administered at 2 mg / kg (total body weight) over 1 hour followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 1 mg / kg / hour (total body weight) until clamping of the umbilical cord.
 Neonatal Dosing: 2 mg / kg orally every 6 hours starting within 12 hours after birth and continuing through 6 weeks of age.
 Neonates unable to receive oral dosing may be administered RETROVIR intravenously at 1.5 mg / kg, infused over 30 minutes, every 6 hours.
 Anemia: Significant anemia (hemoglobin of < 7.5 g / dL or reduction of > 25% of baseline) and / or significant neutropenia (granulocyte count of < 750 cells / mm3 or reduction of > 50% from baseline) may require a dose interruption until evidence of marrow recovery is observed (see WARNINGS).
 End - Stage Renal Disease: In patients maintained on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (CrCl < 15 mL / min), recommended dosing is 1 mg / kg every 6 to 8 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics).
 After dilution, the solution is physically and chemically stable for 24 hours at room temperature and 48 hours if refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F).
 The recommended dose of REVATIO is 5 mg or 20 mg three times a day.
 The recommended dose is 2.5 mg or 10 mg administered as an intravenous bolus injection three times a day.
 A 10 mg dose of REVATIO injection is predicted to provide pharmacological effect of sildenafil and its N - desmethyl metabolite equivalent to that of a 20 mg oral dose.
 REVEX is supplied in two concentrations that can be identified by their color coded container labels: a concentration suitable for postoperative use (100 µg / mL) in a blue labeled ampul containing ONE (1) mL and a concentration suitable for the management of overdose (1 mg / mL, 10 times as concentrated, 20 times as much drug) in a green labeled ampul containing TWO (2) mL.
 Partially reversing doses of REVEX (1 µg / kg) lose their effect as the drug is redistributed through the body, and the effects of these low doses may not last more than 30 - 60 minutes in the presence of persistent opioid effects.
 Fully reversing doses (1 mg / 70 kg) have been shown to last many hours in both experimental and clinical studies, but may complicate the management of patients who are in pain, at high cardiovascular risk, or who are physically dependent on opioids.
 Use 100 µg / mL dosage strength (blue label) and see Table 2 for initial doses.
 This is best accomplished with an initial dose of 0.25 µg / kg followed by 0.25 µg / kg incremental doses at 2 - 5 minute intervals, stopping as soon as the desired degree of opioid reversal is obtained.
 A cumulative total dose above 1.0 µg / kg does not provide additional therapeutic effect.
 In cases where the patient is known to be at increased cardiovascular risk, it may be desirable to dilute REVEX 1:1 with saline or sterile water and use smaller initial and incremental doses of 0.1 µg / kg.
 The recommended initial dose of REVEX for non - opioid dependent patients is 0.5 mg / 70 kg.
 If a total dose of 1.5 mg / 70 kg has been administered without clinical response, additional REVEX (nalmefene hydrochloride injection) is unlikely to have an effect.
 Should intravenous access be lost or not readily obtainable, a pharmacokinetic study has shown that a single dose of REVEX should be effective within 5 - 15 minutes after intramuscular or subcutaneous doses of 1.0 mg. (See Pharmacokinetics.)

 A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients.
 The placebo - controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of REVIA as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of REVIA 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.
 REVIA should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment of alcoholism.
 Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of REVIA.
 If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter.
 A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids.
 Inject 0.2 mg naloxone.
 If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone.
 Administer 0.8 mg naloxone.
 In some cases, 0.1 mg IV naloxone has produced a diagnostic response.
 Thus, patients may receive 50 mg of REVIA every weekday with a 100 mg dose on Saturday, 100 mg every other day, or 150 mg every third day.
 There may be a higher risk of hepatocellular injury with single doses above 50 mg, and use of higher doses and extended dosing intervals should balance the possible risks against the probable benefits (see WARNINGS).
 REVIA should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment.

 Methotrexate is administered orally or intramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for a five - day course.
 One to two courses of methotrexate after normalization of hCG is usually recommended.
 When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg / m² in combination with 60 mg / m² of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks.
 When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg / m².
 It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg / kg intravenously every 14 days.
 Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg / day orally for 4 to 8 days.
 Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods.
 Lymphosarcomas in Stage III may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg / kg daily.
 Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated.
 Dosage in early stages is usuallly 5 to 50 mg once weekly.
 Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy.
 The recommended starting dose is 10 mg / m² given once weekly.
 Experience does suggest, however, that children receiving 20 to 30 mg / m² / wk (0.65 to 1.0 mg / kg / wk) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.
 Weekly therapy may be instituted with the RHEUMATREX® Methotrexate Tablets, USP, 2.5 mg Dose Packs which are designed to provide doses over a range of 5 mg to 20 mg administered as a single weekly dose.
 The recommended starting dosage for adults and children 6 years of age and older is 64 mcg per day administered as one spray per nostril of RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide) Nasal Spray 32 mcg once daily.
 The maximum recommended dosage for adults (12 years of age and older) is 256 mcg per day administered as four sprays per nostril once daily of RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide) Nasal Spray 32 mcg and the maximum recommended dose for pediatric patients (6 to < 12 years of age) is 128 mcg per day administered as two sprays per nostril once daily of RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide) Nasal Spray 32 mcg.
 An improvement in nasal symptoms may be noted in patients within 10 hours of first using RHINOCORT AQUA (budesonide) Nasal Spray, however, clinical improvement usually takes 1 - 2 days with maximum benefit in approximately 2 weeks.
 If not used for two consecutive days, reprime with one spray or until a fine spray appears.
 A single dose (approximately 50 μg)* is contained in each prefilled syringe of MICRhoGAM (rho(d) immune globulin (human)) .
 This dose will suppress the immune response to 2.5 mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.
 A single dose (approximately 300 μg)* is contained in each prefilled syringe of RhoGAM (rho(d) immune globulin (human)) .
 This is the usual dose for the indications associated with pregnancy unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of a fetal - maternal hemorrhage (FMH) in excess of 15 mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.
 In one study, Rh Immune Globulin provided protection against Rh immunization in about 50% of subjects when given 13 days after exposure to Rh - positive cells.21 If delivery occurs within three weeks after the last antepartum dose, the postpartum dose may be withheld, but a test for FMH should be performed to determine if exposure to >15 mL of red cells has occurred.22
 Multiple doses of RhoGAM (rho(d) immune globulin (human)) are required if an FMH exceeds 15 mL.
 Patients in whom FMH is suspected should be tested for FMH by qualitative or quantitative methods.23 In efficacy studies, RhoGAM (rho(d) immune globulin (human)) was shown to suppress Rh immunization in all subjects when given at a dose of >20 μg per mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.3 Thus, a single dose of RhoGAM (rho(d) immune globulin (human)) will suppress the immune response after exposure to <15 mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.
 If delivery occurs within three weeks after the last antepartum dose, the postpartum dose may be withheld, but a test for fetal - maternal hemorrhage should be performed to determine if exposure to > 15 mL of red blood cells has occurred.2
 • < 2.5 mL Rh - positive red blood cells
 MICRhoGAM (50 µg) (250 IU)
 Each single dose prefilled syringe of RhoGAM contains 300 µg (1500 IU) of Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human).
 This is the dose for the indications associated with pregnancy at or beyond 13 weeks unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of a fetal - maternal hemorrhage (FMH) in excess of 15 mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.
 Each single dose prefilled syringe of MICRhoGAM contains 50 µg (250 IU) of Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human).
 This dose will suppress the immune response to up to 2.5 mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.
 Multiple doses of RhoGAM are required if a FMH exceeds 15 mL, an event that is possible but unlikely prior to the third trimester of pregnancy and is most likely at delivery.
 Patients known or suspected to be at increased risk of FMH should be tested for FMH by qualitative or quantitative methods.3 In efficacy studies, RhoGAM was shown to suppress Rh immunization in all subjects when given at a dose of > 20 µg per mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.4 Thus, a single dose of RhoGAM will suppress the immune response after exposure to < 15 mL of Rh - positive red blood cells.
 If delivery occurs within three weeks after the last antepartum dose, the postpartum dose may be withheld, but a test for FMH should be performed to determine if exposure to > 15 mL of red blood cells has occurred.2
 If large doses (greater than 5 mL) are required and intramuscular injection is chosen, it is advisable to administer Rhophylac in divided doses at different sites.
 A 250 IU (50 mcg) per kg body weight dose of Rhophylac is recommended for patients with ITP.
 Dose (IU) x body weight (kg) = Total IU / 1500 IU per syringe = Number of syringes
 Rhophylac should be administered at a rate of 2 mL per 15 to 60 seconds.
 If the patient's fibrinogen level is not known, the recommended dose is 70 mg per kg of body weight administered intravenously.
 Administer RiaSTAP (fibrinogen concentrate (human) for intravenous use) at room temperature by slow intravenous injection at a rate not exceeding 5 mL per minute.
 The usual adult dosage of RIDAURA (auranofin) is 6 mg daily, given either as 3 mg twice daily or 6 mg once daily.

 The initial dose of RIXUBIS is calculated based on the empirical finding that one international unit of RIXUBIS per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX by 0.7 international units / dL of plasma (0.7% of normal) for patients < 12 years of age and by 0.9 international units / dL of plasma (0.9% of normal) in patients ≥ 12 years of age.
 Dose (international units) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (% of normal or IU / dL) x 1.4 dL / kg
 A dose of 1500 international units of RIXUBIS, administered to a 20 kg patient should be expect to result in a peak post - infusion factor IX increase of 1500 international units x {[0.7 IU / dL] / [IU / kg} / [20 kg] = 53.6 international units / dL (53.6% of normal).
 Dose (international units) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX increase (% of normal or IU / dL) x 1.1 dL / kg

 The induction dose of Roferon - A (interferon alfa - 2a, recombinant) is 3 MIU daily for 16 to 24 weeks, administered as a subcutaneous injection.
 The recommended maintenance dose is 3 MIU, tiw.
 For the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines administered for conscious sedation, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 15 seconds.
 If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, a second dose of 0.2 mg (2 mL) can be injected and repeated at 60 - second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of 4 additional times) to a maximum total dose of 1 mg (10 mL).
 The dosage should be individualized based on the patient's response, with most patients responding to doses of 0.6 mg to 1 mg (see Individualization Of Dosage).
 For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (given as 0.2 mg / min) should be administered at any one time, and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.
 It is recommended that flumazenil injection be administered as the series of small injections described (not as a single bolus injection) to allow the practitioner to control the reversal of sedation to the approximate endpoint desired and to minimize the possibility of adverse effects (see Individualization Of Dosage).
 For the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines administered for conscious sedation in pediatric patients greater than 1 year of age, the recommended initial dose is 0.01 mg / kg (up to 0.2 mg) administered intravenously over 15 seconds.
 If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, further injections of 0.01 mg / kg (up to 0.2 mg) can be administered and repeated at 60 - second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of 4 additional times) to a maximum total dose of 0.05 mg / kg or 1 mg, whichever is lower.
 The mean total dose administered in the pediatric clinical trial of flumazenil was 0.65 mg (range: 0.08 mg to 1.00 mg).
 It is recommended that flumazenil injection be administered as the series of small injections described (not as a single bolus injection) to allow the practitioner to control the reversal of sedation to the approximate endpoint desired and to minimize the possibility of adverse effects (see Individualization Of Dosage).
 For the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines administered for general anesthesia, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 15 seconds.
 If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, a further dose of 0.2 mg (2 mL) can be injected and repeated at 60 - second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of 4 additional times) to a maximum total dose of 1 mg (10 mL).
 The dosage should be individualized based on the patient's response, with most patients responding to doses of 0.6 mg to 1 mg (see Individualization Of Dosage).
 For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (given as 0.2 mg / min) should be administered at any one time, and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.
 It is recommended that flumazenil injection be administered as the series of small injections described (not as a single bolus injection) to allow the practitioner to control the reversal of sedation to the approximate endpoint desired and to minimize the possibility of adverse effects (see Individualization Of Dosage).
 For initial management of a known or suspected benzodiazepine overdose, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 30 seconds.
 If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting 30 seconds, a further dose of 0.3 mg (3 mL) can be administered over another 30 seconds.
 Further doses of 0.5 mg (5 mL) can be administered over 30 seconds at 1 - minute intervals up to a cumulative dose of 3 mg.
 Most patients with a benzodiazepine overdose will respond to a cumulative dose of 1 mg to 3 mg of flumazenil injection, and doses beyond 3 mg do not reliably produce additional effects.
 On rare occasions, patients with a partial response at 3 mg may require additional titration up to a total dose of 5 mg (administered slowly in the same manner).
 If a patient has not responded 5 minutes after receiving a cumulative dose of 5 mg of flumazenil injection, the major cause of sedation is likely not to be due to benzodiazepines, and additional flumazenil injection is likely to have no effect.
 For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (given as 0.5 mg / min) should be given at any one time and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.
 Adults and Children 12 years of age and older: 1 teaspoonful (5mL) every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 6 teaspoonsful in 24 hours.

 ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® is intended for the management of moderate to severe pain in patients who require treatment with an oral opioid analgesic.
 Patients who have not been receiving opioid analgesics should be started on ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® in a dosing range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.
 The dose should be titrated based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ®.
 For control of severe chronic pain, ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® should be administered on a regularly scheduled basis, every 4 - 6 hours, at the lowest dosage level that will achieve adequate analgesia.
 Although it is not possible to list every condition that is important to the selection of the initial dose of ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ®, attention should be given to: 1) the daily dose, potency, and characteristics of a pure agonist or mixed agonist / antagonist the patient has been taking previously, 2) the reliability of the relative potency estimate to calculate the dose of oxycodone needed, 3) the degree of opioid tolerance, 4) the general condition and medical status of the patient, and 5) the balance between pain control and adverse experiences.
 If a decision is made to discontinue the use of non - opioid analgesic, it may be necessary to titrate the dose of ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® in response to the level of analgesia and adverse effects afforded by the dosing regimen.
 If the non - opioid regimen is continued as a separate single entity agent, the starting dose ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® should be based upon the most recent dose of opioid as a baseline for further titration of oxycodone.
 If a patient has been receiving opioid - containing medications prior to taking ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ®, the potency of the prior opioid relative to oxycodone should be factored into the selection of the total daily dose (TDD) of oxycodone.
 In converting patients from other opioids to ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patient's response to ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® is imperative.
 Administration of supplemental analgesia for breakthrough or incident pain and titration of the total daily dose of ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® may be necessary, especially in patients who have disease states that are changing rapidly.
 Continual re - evaluation of the patient receiving ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® is important, with special attention to the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of side effects associated with therapy.
 When a patient no longer requires therapy with ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® or other opioid analgesics for the treatment of their pain, it is important that therapy be gradually discontinued over time to prevent the development of an opioid abstinence syndrome (narcotic withdrawal).
 It is not known at what dose of ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® that treatment may be discontinued without risk of the opioid abstinence syndrome.
 Patients who have not been receiving opioid analgesics should be started on ROXICODONE® in a dosing range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.
 Although it is not possible to list every condition that is important to the selection of the initial dose of ROXICODONE® , attention should be given to: 1) the daily dose, potency, and characteristics of a pure agonist or mixed agonist / antagonist the patient has been taking previously, 2) the reliability of the relative potency estimate to calculate the dose of oxycodone needed, 3) the degree of opioid tolerance, 4) the general condition and medical status of the patient, and 5) the balance between pain control and adverse experiences.

 Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day.
 During the first cycle of Safyral use, instruct the patient to take one orange Safyral daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle.
 She should take one orange Safyral daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light orange tablet, containing levomefolate alone, daily on Days 22 through 28.
 During the first cycle of Safyral use, instruct the patient to take one orange Safyral daily, beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period.
 She should take one orange Safyral daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one light orange tablet, containing levomefolate alone, daily on Days 22 through 28.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.
 If the patient misses one or more light orange tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of orange tablets on the proper day.
 If vomiting occurs within 3 - 4 hours after tablet - taking, this can be regarded as a missed tablet.
 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women of childbearing age consume supplemental folic acid in a dose of at least 0.4 mg (400 mcg) daily.1 Consider other folate supplementation that a woman may be taking before prescribing Safyral.
 The recommended weekly dosage is 0.18 mg / kg of body weight by subcutaneous injection.
 Based on the dosing utilized in the original pivotal study described herein, the recommended dosage at the start of therapy is not more than 0.005 mg / kg given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
 Alternatively, taking into account more recent literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg / day (range, 0.15 - 0.30 mg / day) may be used without consideration of body weight.
 This dose can be increased gradually every 1 to 2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg / day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF - 1 concentrations.
 After determining the appropriate patient dose, reconstitute each vial of Saizen® as follows: 5 mg vial with 1 to 3 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (Benzyl Alcohol preserved); 8.8 mg vial with 23 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (Benzyl Alcohol preserved).
 Regardless of the indication, the starting dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be 5 mg twice daily, followed by adjustment based on therapeutic response and tolerability.
 The recommended initial dose of SALAGEN® Tablets is 5 mg taken three times a day.
 (Not to exceed 10 mg per dose.)
 The recommended dose of SALAGEN® Tablets is 5 mg taken four times a day.
 The usual starting dose for SAMSCA is 15 mg administered once daily without regard to meals.
 Increase the dose to 30 mg once daily, after at least 24 hours, to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, as needed to achieve the desired level of serum sodium.
 The recommended dose is 20 mg twice daily.
 The recommended dosage of SANCTURA XR® is one 60 mg capsule daily in the morning.
 Apply a single patch to the upper outer arm a minimum of 24 hours before chemotherapy.
 The initial oral dose of Sandimmune (cyclosporine) should be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation as a single dose of 15 mg / kg.
 Although a daily single dose of 14 to 18 mg / kg was used in most clinical trials, few centers continue to use the highest dose, most favoring the lower end of the scale.
 There is a trend towards use of even lower initial doses for renal transplantation in the ranges of 10 to 14 mg / kg / day.
 The initial single daily dose is continued postoperatively for 1 to 2 weeks and then tapered by 5% per week to a maintenance dose of 5 to 10 mg / kg / day.
 Some centers have successfully tapered the maintenance dose to as low as 3 mg / kg / day in selected renal transplant patients without an apparent rise in rejection rate.
 A dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2.0 mg / kg / day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg / kg / day by 1 week, 0.6 mg / kg / day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg / kg / day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg / kg / day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose.
 Another center started with an initial dose of 200 mg tapered by 40 mg / day until reaching 20 mg / day.
 After 2 months at this dose, a further reduction to 10 mg / day was made.
 The initial dose of Sandimmune Injection (cyclosporine injection, USP) should be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation as a single intravenous dose of 5 to 6 mg / kg / day.
 This daily single dose is continued postoperatively until the patient can tolerate the soft gelatin capsules or oral solution.
 Immediately before use, the intravenous concentrate should be diluted 1 mL Sandimmune Injection (cyclosporine injection, USP) in 20 mL to 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection and given in a slow intravenous infusion over approximately 2 to 6 hours.
 While no fixed relationships have yet been established, in one series of 375 consecutive cadaveric renal transplant recipients, dosage was adjusted to achieve specific whole blood 24 - hour trough concentrations of 100 to 200 ng / mL as determined by high - pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).
 The initial dosage is usually 50 mcg administered twice or three times daily.
 Dosage may be initiated at 50 mcg t.i.d.
 The goal is to achieve growth hormone levels less than 5 ng / mL or IGF - I (somatomedin C) levels less than 1.9 U / mL in males and less than 2.2 U / mL in females.
 The dose most commonly found to be effective is 100 mcg t.i.d., but some patients require up to 500 mcg t.i.d.
 Doses greater than 300 mcg / day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced.
 The suggested daily dosage of Sandostatin (octreotide acetate) during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 - 600 mcg / day in 2 - 4 divided doses (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg).
 In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg / day.
 However, experience with doses above 750 mcg / day is limited.
 Daily dosages of 200 - 300 mcg in 2 - 4 divided doses are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range 150 - 750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease.
 On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg / day are not required.
 Most patients require doses of 100 mcg to 200 mcg three times daily for maximum effect but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times daily.
 Patients currently receiving Sandostatin Injection can be switched directly to Sandostatin LAR Depot in a dose of 20 mg given IM intragluteally at 4 - week intervals for 3 months.
 The suggested daily dosage for carcinoid tumors during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100 - 600 mcg / day in 2 - 4 divided doses (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg).
 Some patients may require doses up to 1500 mcg / day.
 The suggested daily dosage for VIPomas is 200 - 300 mcg in 2 - 4 divided doses (range 150 - 750 mcg); dosage may be adjusted on an individual basis to control symptoms but usually doses above 450 mcg / day are not required.
 Patients currently receiving Sandostatin Injection can be switched to Sandostatin LAR Depot in a dosage of 20 mg given IM intragluteally at 4 - week intervals for 2 months.
 In patients with renal failure requiring dialysis, the starting dose should be 10 mg every 4 weeks.
 In other patients with renal impairment, the starting dose should be similar to a nonrenal patient (i.e., 20 mg every 4 weeks) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 In patients with established cirrhosis of the liver, the starting dose should be 10 mg every 4 weeks [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Usual adult dose 4 - 8 mg daily.
 SAPHRIS is a sublingual tablet.
 The recommended dose of SAPHRIS is 5 mg given twice daily.
 In short - term controlled trials, there was no suggestion of added benefit with a 10 mg twice daily dose, but there was a clear increase in certain adverse reactions.
 If tolerated, daily dosage can be increased to 10 mg twice daily after one week.
 The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical studies [see Clinical Studies].
 Monotherapy in Adults: The recommended starting and treatment dose of SAPHRIS is 5 mg to 10 mg twice daily.
 The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies].
 Monotherapy in Pediatric Patients: The recommended dose of SAPHRIS is 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age, and dose may be adjusted for individual response and tolerability.
 The starting dose of SAPHRIS is 2.5 mg twice daily.
 After 3 days, the dose can be increased to 5 mg twice daily, and from 5 mg to 10 mg twice daily after 3 additional days.
 Pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years appear to be more sensitive to dystonia with initial dosing with SAPHRIS when the recommended escalation schedule is not followed [see Use in Specific Populations].
 The safety of doses greater than 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Adjunctive Therapy in Adults: The recommended starting dose of SAPHRIS is 5 mg twice daily when administered as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate.
 Depending on the clinical response and tolerability in the individual patient, the dose can be increased to 10 mg twice daily.
 The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate has not been evaluated in clinical trials.
 Monotherapy in Adults: Continue on the SAPHRIS dose that the patient received during stabilization (5 mg to 10 mg twice daily).
 Depending on the clinical response and tolerability in the individual patient, a dose of 10 mg twice daily can be decreased to 5 mg twice daily.
 The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dose of SARAFEM for the treatment of PMDD is 20 mg / day given continuously (every day of the menstrual cycle) or intermittently (defined as starting a daily dose 14 days prior to the anticipated onset of menstruation through the first full day of menses and repeating with each new cycle).
 In a study comparing continuous dosing of fluoxetine 20 and 60 mg / day to placebo, both doses were proven to be effective, but there was no statistically significant added benefit for the 60 mg / day compared with the 20 mg / day dose.
 Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg / day have not been systematically studied in patients with PMDD.
 The maximum fluoxetine dose should not exceed 80 mg / day [see Clinical Studies].
 Systematic evaluation of SARAFEM has shown that its efficacy in PMDD is maintained for periods of up to 6 months at a dose of 20 mg / day given continuously and up to 3 months at a dose of 20 mg / day given intermittently [see Clinical Studies].
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with SARAFEM is unclear.
 The recommended dose of SAVAYSA is 60 mg taken orally once daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Clinical Studies].
 Reduce SAVAYSA dose to 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL / min [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 *Cockcroft - Gault CrCL = (140 - age) x (weight in kg) x (0.85 if female) / (72 x creatinine in mg / dL).
 The recommended dose of SAVAYSA is 60 mg taken orally once daily following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dose of SAVAYSA is 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL / min, patients who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg, or patients who are taking certain concomitant P - gp inhibitor medications based on clinical study data in this indication [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dose of Savella is 100 mg / day (50 mg twice daily).
 Day 1: 12.5 mg once
 Days 2 - 3: 25 mg / day (12.5 mg twice daily)

 After Day 7: 100 mg / day (50 mg twice daily)
 Based on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 200 mg / day (100 mg twice daily).
 Doses above 200 mg / day have not been studied.
 For patients with severe renal impairment (indicated by an estimated creatinine clearance of 5 - 29 mL / min), the maintenance dose should be reduced by 50% to 50 mg / day (25 mg twice daily).
 Based on individual patient response, the dose may be increased to 100 mg / day (50 mg twice daily).
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with Savella is unclear.
 The recommended dosage of Saxenda® is 3 mg daily.
 Saxenda® should be discontinued, however, if a patient cannot tolerate the 3 mg dose, as efficacy has not been established at lower doses (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 mg).
 Conversely, if discontinuing Saxenda® in patients with type 2 diabetes, monitor for an increase in blood glucose.
 If more than 3 days have elapsed since the last Saxenda® dose, patients should reinitiate Saxenda® at 0.6 mg daily and follow the dose escalation schedule in Table 1, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.
 The dosage of Seasonale® (levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol) is one pink (active) tablet daily for 84 consecutive days, followed by 7 days of white (inert) tablets.
 One pink tablet should be taken daily for 84 consecutive days, followed by 7 days on which a white (inert) tablet is taken.
 If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a non - hormonal backup method of birth control until she has taken a pink tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
 Any time the patient misses two or more pink tablets, she should also use another method of non - hormonal back - up contraception until she has taken a pink tablet daily for seven consecutive days.
 If the patient misses one or more white tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking pink tablets again on the proper day.
 Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day.
 The dosage of Seasonique (levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol) is one light blue - green tablet containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol daily for 84 consecutive days, followed by one yellow ethinyl estradiol tablet for 7 days.
 One light blue - green tablet should be taken daily for 84 consecutive days, followed by one yellow tablet for 7 consecutive days.
 Begin the next and all subsequent 91 - day cycles without interruption on the same day of the week (Sunday) on which the patient began her first dose of Seasonique (levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol) , following the same schedule: 84 days taking a light blue - green tablet followed by 7 days taking a yellow tablet.
 If the patient starts on Seasonique (levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol) postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken a light blue - green tablet for 7 consecutive days.
 Adults - As a hypnotic, 100 mg at bedtime.
 Preoperatively, 200 to 300 mg 1 to 2 hours before surgery.

 Dissolve the contents of the vial of SecreFlo™ (secretin) in 8 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection USP, to yield a concentration of 2 mcg / mL.
 The initial dosage of Sectral in uncomplicated mild - to - moderate hypertension is 400 mg.
 This can be given as a single daily dose, but in occasional patients twice daily dosing may be required for adequate 24 - hour blood - pressure control.
 An optimal response is usually achieved with dosages of 400 to 800 mg per day, although some patients have been maintained on as little as 200 mg per day.
 Patients with more severe hypertension or who have demonstrated inadequate control may respond to a total of 1200 mg daily (administered b.i.d.
 The usual initial dose of Sectral is 400 mg daily given as 200 mg b.i.d.
 Dosage should be increased gradually until an optimal clinical response is obtained, generally at 600 to 1200 mg per day.
 Doses above 800 mg / day should be avoided in the elderly.
 The recommended dose of SEEBRI NEOHALER is the inhalation of the contents of one SEEBRI capsule twice - daily using the SEEBRI NEOHALER device.
 SEEBRI NEOHALER should be administered at the same time of the day, (1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening), every day.
 More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 capsule twice - daily) of SEEBRI NEOHALER is not recommended.
 For seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff: Generally 2 applications each week for 2 weeks will control symptoms.
 Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff:   Usually two applications each week for two weeks will afford control.

 The recommended dosage for adults and adolescents 12 years and older is one capsule administered orally, every 4 to 6 hours four times a day.
 The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar is 30 mg once daily.
 Sensipar should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH levels of 150 to 300 pg / mL.
 The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar is 30 mg twice daily.
 The dose of Sensipar should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg twice daily, and 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg 3 or 4 times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels.
 For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg / dL but remains above 7.5 mg / dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium - containing phosphate binders and / or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium.
 If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg / dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg / dL and / or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved.
 Solutions should be stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].

 SEROQUEL dose should be reduced to one sixth of original dose when co - medicated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.).
 The usual starting dose of Serostim® is 0.1 mg / kg subcutaneously once daily (up to a total dose of 6 mg).
 Treatment with Serostim® 0.1 mg / kg every other day was associated with fewer side effects, and resulted in a similar improvement in work output, as compared with Serostim® 0.1 mg / kg daily.
 Therefore, a starting dose of Serostim® 0.1 mg / kg every other day should be considered in patients at increased risk for adverse effects related to recombinant human growth hormone therapy (i.e., glucose intolerance).
 Each vial of Serostim® 5 mg or 6 mg is reconstituted with 0.5 to 1 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP.
 Each vial of Serostim® 4 mg is reconstituted in 0.5 to 1 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% Benzyl Alcohol preserved).
 Serostim® can be administered using (1) a standard sterile, disposable syringe and needle, (2) a compatible Serostim® needle - free injection device or (3) a compatible Serostim® needle injection device.
 The recommended starting dose for SERZONE (nefazodone hydrochloride) is 200 mg / day, administered in two divided doses (BID).
 In the controlled clinical trials establishing the antidepressant efficacy of SERZONE (nefazodone) , the effective dose range was generally 300 to 600 mg / day.
 Dose increases should occur in increments of 100 mg / day to 200 mg / day, again on a BID schedule, at intervals of no less than 1 week.
 The recommended initial dose for elderly or debilitated patients is 100 mg / day, administered in two divided doses (BID).
 Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of SERZONE (nefazodone) has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 36 weeks following 16 weeks of open - label acute treatment (treated for 52 weeks total) at dosages that averaged 438 mg / day.
 The recommended dosage range of SIGNIFOR is 0.3 to 0.9 mg by subcutaneous injection twice a day.
 The recommended initial dose is either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg twice a day.
 For patients who are started on 0.6 mg twice a day, a dosage increase to 0.9 mg twice a day may be considered based on the response to the treatment, as long as the 0.6 mg dosage is well tolerated by the patient.
 Dose reduction by 0.3 mg decrements per injection is suggested.
 For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), the recommended initial dosage is 0.3 mg twice a day and the maximum dosage is 0.6 mg twice a day.
 The recommended initial dose of SIGNIFOR LAR is 40 mg administered by intramuscular injection once every 4 weeks (every 28 days) [see Reconstitution and Intramuscular Injection Instructions].
 The dose may be increased to a maximum of 60 mg for patients who have not normalized growth hormone (GH) and / or age and sex adjusted insulin - like growth factor - 1 (IGF - 1) levels after 3 months of treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR at 40 mg and who tolerate this dose [see ADVERSE REACTIONS and Clinical Studies].
 The dose may be decreased, either temporarily or permanently, by 20 mg decrements [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended initial dose for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child - Pugh B) is 20 mg every 4 weeks and the maximum recommended dose is 40 mg every 4 weeks.
 After reconstitution of the 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg SIGNIFOR LAR vials with the provided 2 mL diluent, the injectable suspension will have a final concentration of 10 mg / mL, 20 mg / mL and 30 mg / mL and should be delivered in its entirety.
 There are 2 critical steps in the reconstitution of SIGNIFOR LAR.
 Insert the needle fully into the left or right gluteus at a 90° angle to the skin.
 The recommended dose of Silenor (doxepin tablets) for adults is 6 mg once daily.

 SIMCOR should be taken as a single daily dose at bedtime, with a low fat snack.
 Patients not currently on niacin extended - release and patients currently on niacin products other than niacin extended - release should start SIMCOR at a single 500 / 20 mg tablet daily at bedtime.
 Patients already taking simvastatin 20 to 40 mg who need additional management of their lipid levels may be started on a SIMCOR dose of 500 / 40 mg once daily at bedtime [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The dose of niacin extended - release should not be increased by more than 500 mg daily every 4 weeks - see Table 1.
 Table 1: Recommended niacin extended - release dosing
 The recommended maintenance dose for SIMCOR is 1000 / 20 mg to 2000 / 40 mg (two 1000 / 20 mg tablets) once daily depending on patient tolerability and lipid levels.
 The efficacy and safety of doses of SIMCOR greater than 2000 / 40 mg daily have not been studied and are therefore not recommended.
 Flushing [see ADVERSE REACTIONS] may be reduced in frequency or severity by pretreatment with aspirin up to the recommended dose of 325 mg (taken approximately 30 minutes prior to SIMCOR dose).
 Because of an increased risk for myopathy in Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses ( ≥ 1 g / day niacin) of niacin - containing products, caution should be used when prescribing SIMCOR in doses that exceed 1000 / 20 mg / day to Chinese patients.
 The SIMPONI dose regimen is 50 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once a month.
 The recommended SIMPONI induction dosage regimen is a 200 - mg subcutaneous injection at Week 0, followed by 100 mg at Week 2, and then maintenance therapy with 100 mg every 4 weeks.

 It is recommended to use Simvastatin Oral Suspension 40 mg / 5 mL for dosages greater than or equal to 40 mg. Lipid determinations should be performed after 4 weeks of therapy and periodically thereafter.
 Due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, particularly during the first year of treatment, use of an 80 - mg dose of Simvastatin Oral Suspension should be restricted to patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, associated with an 80 - mg dose of Simvastatin Oral Suspension, patients unable to achieve their LDL - C goal utilizing the 40 - mg dose of Simvastatin Oral Suspension should not be titrated to an 80mg dose, but should be placed on alternative LDL - C - lowering treatment(s) that provides greater LDL - C lowering.
 The recommended dosage is 40 mg / day in the evening on an empty stomach [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Restricted Dosing for 80 mg].
 Simvastatin Oral Suspension dosage should not exceed 20 mg / day (or 40 mg / day for patients who have previously taken 80 mg / day of simvastatin chronically, e.g., for 12 months or more, without evidence of muscle toxicity) while taking lomitapide.
 The recommended usual starting dose is 10 mg once a day in the evening on an empty stomach.
 The recommended dosing range is 10 to 40 mg / day; the maximum recommended dose is 40 mg / day.
 However, caution should be exercised when Simvastatin Oral Suspension is administered to patients with severe renal impairment; such patients should be started at 5 mg / day and be closely monitored [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Because of an increased risk for myopathy in Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 g / day niacin) of niacin - containing products, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg / day coadministered with lipid - modifying doses of niacin - containing products.
 Because the risk for myopathy is dose - related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses of niacin - containing products.
 SINEMET tablets are available in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (SINEMET 25 - 100) as well as 1:10 ratio (SINEMET 25 - 250 and SINEMET 10 - 100).
 Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 to 100 mg a day.
 Dosage is best initiated with one tablet of SINEMET 25 - 100 three times a day.
 This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per day.
 Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day, as necessary, until a dosage of eight tablets of SINEMET 25 - 100 a day is reached.
 If SINEMET 10 - 100 is used, dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day.
 Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (2 tablets q.i.d.)
 Patients who are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one tablet of SINEMET 25 - 100 three or four times a day.
 The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of levodopa is one tablet of SINEMET 25 - 250 three or four times a day.
 At least 70 to 100 mg of carbidopa per day should be provided.
 When a greater proportion of carbidopa is required, one tablet of SINEMET 25 - 100 may be substituted for each tablet of SINEMET 10 - 100.
 If necessary, the dosage of carbidopa levodopa 25 - 250 may be increased by onehalf or one tablet every day or every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day.
 Experience with total daily dosages of carbidopa greater than 200 mg is limited.
 If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual daily dosage may be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication.
 Patients currently treated with conventional carbidopa levodopa preparations: Studies show that peripheral dopa - decarboxylase is saturated by the bioavailable carbidopa at doses of 70 mg a day and greater.
 In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial dose is usually 1 tablet of SINEMET CR 50 - 200 b.i.d.
 Patients not receiving levodopa: In patients with mild to moderate disease, the initial recommended dose is 1 tablet of SINEMET CR 50 - 200 b.i.d.
 Most patients have been adequately treated with doses of SINEMET CR that provide 400 to 1600 mg of levodopa per day, administered as divided doses at intervals ranging from 4 to 8 hours during the waking day.
 Higher doses of SINEMET CR (2400 mg or more of levodopa per day) and shorter intervals (less than 4 hours) have been used, but are not usually recommended.
 A dose of carbidopa levodopa immediate release 25 - 100 or 10 - 100 (one half or a whole tablet) can be added to the dosage regimen of SINEMET CR in selected patients with advanced disease who need additional immediate - release levodopa for a brief time during daytime hours.
 If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual dosage should be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication.
 For most patients with illness of mild to moderate severity, a starting daily dose of 75 mg is recommended.
 The usual optimum dose range is 75 mg / day to 150 mg / day.
 In more severely ill patients higher doses may be required with subsequent gradual increase to 300 mg / day if necessary.
 Additional therapeutic effect is rarely to be obtained by exceeding a dose of 300 mg / day.
 Some of these patients have been controlled on doses as low as 25 – 50 mg / day.
 If the once - a - day schedule is employed, the maximum recommended dose is 150 mg / day.
 The 150 mg capsule strength is intended for maintenance therapy only and is not recommended for initiation of treatment.

 Effective use of theophylline (i.e.,the concentration of drug in the serum associated with optimal benefit and minimal risk of toxicity) is considered to occur when the theophylline concentration is maintained from 10 to 20 pg / mL.
 If it is not possible to obtain serum level determinations, restriction of the daily dose (in otherwise healthy adults) to not greater than 13 mg / kg / day to a maximum of 900 mg of anhydrous theophylline in divided doses will result in relatively few patients exceeding serum levels of 20 pg / mL and the resultant greater risk of toxicity.
 Dosage should be calculated on the basis of lean (ideal) body weight where mg / kg doses are presented.
 The loading dose for theophylline is based on the principle that each 0.5 mg / kg of theophylline administered as a loading dose will result in a 1.0 µg / mL increase in serum theophylline concentration.
 When there is sufficient respiratory distress to warrant a small risk, then 2.5 mg / kg of theophylline administered in rapidly absorbed form is likely to increase serum concentration by approximately 5 pg / mL.
 16 mg / kg / 24 hours or 400 mg / 24 hours (whichever is less) of anhydrous theophylline in divided doses at 6 - or 8 - hour intervals.
 Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.
 Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given, such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.
 One Slow - K tablet provides 8 mEq of potassium chloride.
 Sodium Acetate (sodium acetate (sodium acetate (sodium acetate injection) injection) injection) Injection, USP 40 mEq is administered intravenously only after dilution in a larger volume of fluid.
 Using aseptic technique, all or part of the contents of one or more vials may be added to other intravenous fluids to provide any desired number of milliequivalents (mEq) of sodium (Na+) with an equal number of acetate (CH3COO - ).
 For mild acidosis, the usual dosage is 1 to 2 mEq per kg of body weight, administered slowly.
 For more severe acidosis, 2 to 5 mEq per kg of body weight may be administered over a 4 to 8 hour period.
 In emergencies, 300 to 500 mL of the 5% Sodium Bicarbonate (sodium bicarbonate 5% injection) Injection should or administered as rapidly as is possible without overalkalinizing the patient.
 Thyroid Uptake: 0.185 to 0.555 megabecquerels (5 to 15 microcuries)

 Sodium Lactate (sodium lactate injection in aviva) Injection, 50 mEq (5 mEq / mL), is administered intravenously only after addition to a larger volume of fluid.The amount of sodium ion and lactate ion to be added to larger volume intravenous fluids should be determined in accordance with the electrolyte requirements of each individual patient.
 All or part of the contents of one (50 mEq in 10 mL) or more vial containers may be added to other intravenous solutions to provide any desired number of milliequivalents of lactate anion (with the same number of milliequiva - lents of Na+).
 The contents of one container (50 mEq in 10 mL) added to 290 mL of a nonelectrolyte solution or of Sterile Water for Injection will provide 300 mL of an approximately isotonic (1 / 6 molar) concentration of sodium lactate (sodium lactate injection in aviva) (1.9%), containing 167 mEq / L each of Na+ and lactate anion.
 Depending on the desired concentration, the solution containing 50 mg of sodium nitroprusside must be further diluted in 250 to 1,000 mL of sterile 5% dextrose injection.
 Infusion of sodium nitroprusside should therefore be started at a very low rate (0.3 mcg / kg / min), with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum recommended infusion rate (10 mcg / kg / min) has been reached.
 Table 2 below shows the infusion rates corresponding to the recommended initial and maximal doses (0.3 mcg / kg / min and 10 mcg / kg / min, respectively) for both adult and pediatric patients of various weights.
 Table 2: Infusion Rates (mL / hour) to Achieve Initial (0.3 mcg / kg / min) and Maximal (10 mcg / kg / min) Dosing of Sodium Nitroprusside
 As described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY above, when more than 500 mcg / kg of sodium nitroprusside is administered faster than 2 mcg / kg / min, cyanide is generated faster than the unaided patient can eliminate it.
 Rare patients receiving more than 10 mg / kg of sodium nitroprusside will develop methemoglobinemia; other patients, especially those with impaired renal function, will predictably develop thiocyanate toxicity after prolonged, rapid infusions.

 Therapy with SORIATANE should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg per day, given as a single dose with the main meal.
 Maintenance doses of 25 to 50 mg per day may be given dependent upon an individual patient's response to initial treatment.
 The recommended initial dose is 80 mg twice daily.
 This dose may be increased, if necessary, after appropriate evaluation to 240 or 320 mg / day (120 to 160 mg twice daily).
 In most patients, a therapeutic response is obtained at a total daily dose of 160 to 320 mg / day, given in two or three divided doses.
 Some patients with life - threatening refractory ventricular arrhythmias may require doses as high as 480 to 640 mg / day; however, these doses should only be prescribed when the potential benefit outweighs the increased risk of adverse events, in particular proarrhythmia.
 For initiation of treatment, 30 mg / m² three times a day (90 mg / m² total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total daily dose for adults.
 Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg / m² (approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur.
 For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.97)=29.1 mg / m², administered three times daily.
 For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 X 0.68)=20 mg / m², administered three times daily.
 For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 X 0.3)=9 mg / m².
 As in adults Sorine ® (sotalol hydrochloride) Tablets should be used with particular caution in children if the QTc is greater than 500 msec on therapy, and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QTc exceeds 550 msec.
 This compounding procedure results in a solution containing 5 mg / mL of sotalol HCl.
 The dosage should be kept small, using 0.5 to 2 mL (preferably 1 mL maximum) for each injection, and the maximum single treatment should not exceed 10 mL.
 The recommended dosage range for Sotret (isotret (isotret (isotretinoin capsules) inoin capsules) inoin capsules) is 0.5 to 1.0 mg / kg / day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks.
 In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg / kg / day8, it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages.
 Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2.0 mg / kg / day, as tolerated.
 Start sotalol therapy only if the baseline QTc interval is < 450 msec.
 If the QTc interval prolongs to 500 msec or greater, reduce the dose, increase the interval between doses, or discontinue the drug.
 Administer sotalol twice daily in patients with a creatinine clearance > 60 mL / min or once daily in patients with creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL / min.
 Sotalol is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance < 40 mL / min.
 The recommended initial oral dose of sotalol is 80 mg (once or twice daily) and is initiated and titrated as described below.

 Table 1 shows the appropriate volume of SOTYLIZE solution for typical doses.
 The recommended initial dose of oral sotalol for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmia is 80 mg, once or twice daily based on creatinine clearance [see General Rules and Safety Measures of Oral Sotalol Therapy].
 The dose may be increased in increments of 80 mg per day every 3 days as needed, provided QTc < 500 msec.
 The usual therapeutic effect is observed with oral doses of 80 to 160 mg once or twice a day.
 For initiation of treatment, 30 mg / m² three times a day (90 mg / m² total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total daily dose for adults.
 Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg / m² (approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur.
 For a child with normal renal function aged 1 month, the initial starting dose would be (30 x 0.7) = 21 mg / m², administered three times daily.
 For a child aged about 1 week, the initial starting dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the starting dose would be (30 x 0.3) = 9 mg / m².
 The recommended initial dose of oral sotalol for the treatment of symptomatic AFIB / AFL is 80 mg, once or twice daily based on creatinine clearance [see General Rules and Safety Measures of Oral Sotalol Therapy].
 If that dose level at steady - state does not acceptably reduce the time to 4 recurrence of arrhythmia and is tolerated with QTc < 520 msec, increase the dose to 160 mg orally once or twice a day every three days.
 In the U.S. multicenter dose - response study, 120 mg orally once or twice a day was found to be the most effective dose in prolonging the time to ECG - documented symptomatic recurrence of AFIB / AFL.
 The recommended dosage of SOVALDI is one 400 mg tablet, taken orally, once daily with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

 The recommended dosage for patients with asthma is 2 inhalations of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 1.25 mcg per actuation once - daily; total dose equals 2.5 mcg of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT.
 The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules).
 If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100 - mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily.
 Doses above 200 mg / day should be given in two divided doses.
 A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended.
 Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg / day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment.

 The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg / day has not been studied.
 Initiate SPRITAM with a daily dose of 1000 mg, given as twice daily dosing (500 mg twice daily).
 Increase the dosage by 1000 mg / day (500 mg twice daily) every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg (1500 mg twice daily).
 The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg / day has not been adequately studied.
 Initiate SPRITAM with a daily dose of 500 mg, given as twice daily dosing (250 mg twice daily).
 Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 500 mg (250 mg twice daily) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 1500 mg (750 mg twice daily).
 The recommended dose is 31.5 mg SPRIX (one 15.75 mg spray in each nostril) every 6 to 8 hours.
 The maximum daily dose is 126 mg (four doses).
 For patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired patients, and adult patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs), the recommended dose is 15.75 mg SPRIX (one 15.75 mg spray in only one nostril) every 6 to 8 hours.
 The maximum daily dose is 63 mg (four doses) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Do not use any single SPRIX bottle for more than one day as it will not deliver the intended dose after 24 hours.
 The recommended starting dosage of SPRYCEL for chronic phase CML is 100 mg administered orally once daily.
 The recommended starting dosage of SPRYCEL for accelerated phase CML, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML, or Ph+ ALL is 140 mg administered orally once daily.
 Based on pharmacokinetic studies, a dose decrease to 20 mg daily should be considered for patients taking SPRYCEL 100 mg daily.
 For patients taking SPRYCEL 140 mg daily, a dose decrease to 40 mg daily should be considered.
 In clinical studies of adult CML and Ph+ ALL patients, dose escalation to 140 mg once daily (chronic phase CML) or 180 mg once daily (advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL) was allowed in patients who did not achieve a hematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dosage.
 The usual recommended dose for initial nasal administration is 1 mg (1 spray in one nostril).
 If adequate pain relief is not achieved within 60 to 90 minutes, an additional 1 mg dose may be given.
 Depending on the severity of the pain, an initial dose of 2 mg (1 spray in each nostril) may be used in patients who will be able to remain recumbent in the event drowsiness or dizziness occurs.
 In such patients single additional 2 mg doses should not be given for 3 to 4 hours.
 Clinical experience with daily doses above 1,600 mg of entacapone is limited.
 Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 mg per day to 100 mg per day.
 Patients currently treated with entacapone 200 mg with each dose of non - extended release carbidopa / levodopa tablet, can switch to the corresponding strength of Stalevo containing the same amounts of levodopa and carbidopa.
 For example, patients receiving one tablet of carbidopa / levodopa 25 mg / 100 mg and one tablet of entacapone 200 mg at each administration can switch to a single Stalevo 100 tablet (containing 25 mg of carbidopa, 100 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone).
 Patients with a history of moderate or severe dyskinesias or taking more than 600 mg of the levodopa component per day are likely to require a reduction in their daily levodopa dose when entacapone is added.
 Because dose adjustment of the individual carbidopa or levodopa component is not possible with fixed - dose products, initially titrate patients to a dose that is tolerated and that meets their individual therapeutic need using a separate carbidopa / levodopa tablet (1:4 ratio) plus an entacapone tablet.
 Once the patient's individual dose of carbidopa / levodopa plus entacapone dose has been established using two separate tablets; switch the patient to a corresponding single tablet of Stalevo.
 Administer only one tablet at each dosing interval.
 All strengths of Stalevo contain 200 mg of entacapone.
 The recommended starting and maintenance dose of Starlix, alone or in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione, is 120 mg three times daily before meals.
 The recommended initial dose is 750 mg daily in divided doses.
 In placebo - controlled clinical trials of acute mania, patients were dosed to a clinical response with a trough plasma concentration between 50 and 125 mcg / mL.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg / kg / day.
 Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg / kg / day.
 The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg / kg / week to achieve optimal clinical response.
 Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg / kg / day.
 If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg / mL).
 No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg / kg / day can be made.
 The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg / mL in females and 135 mcg / mL in males.
 Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg / kg / day.
 The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg / kg / week to achieve optimal clinical response.
 Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg / kg / day.
 If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 - 100 mcg / mL).
 No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg / kg / day can be made.
 STAVZOR may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg / kg / day.
 The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg / kg / week to achieve optimal clinical response.
 Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg / kg / day.
 If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg / mL).
 No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg / kg / day can be made.
 If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in 2 to 3 doses.
 The recommended initial dose is 15 mg / kg / day, increasing at 1 - week intervals by 5 to 10 mg / kg / day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg / kg / day.
 If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in 2 to 3 doses.
 However, therapeutic valproate serum concentrations for most patients with absence seizures are considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg / mL.
 The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily.
 Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1000 mg / day.
 The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg / mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg / mL (males) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 STAXYN is available in 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets.
 STAXYN is not interchangeable with vardenafil 10 mg film - coated tablets (LEVITRA).
 STAXYN provides higher systemic exposure compared to vardenafil 10 mg film - coated tablets (LEVITRA).
 The maximum dosing frequency is one STAXYN tablet per day.
 In subjects weighing more than 100 kg, 45 mg was also shown to be efficacious.
 However, 90 mg resulted in greater efficacy in these subjects [see Clinical Studies].
 A single intravenous infusion dose of STELARA® using the weight - based dosage regimen specified in Table 1 [see Instructions for dilution of STELARA® 130 mg vial for intravenous infusion].
 The recommended maintenance dosage is a subcutaneous 90 mg dose administered 8 weeks after the initial intravenous dose, then every 8 weeks thereafter.
 Usual dosage is 1 or 2 mg twice daily.
 Do not administer at doses of more than 6 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks.
 Oral: Usual starting dosage is 2 mg to 5 mg b.i.d.
 (Small or emaciated patients should always be started on the lower dosage.)
 Most patients will show optimum response on 15 mg or 20 mg daily, although a few may require 40 mg a day or more.
 When the Concentrate dosage form is to be used, it should be added to 60 mL (2 fl oz) or more of diluent just prior to administration to insure palatability and stability.
 Intramuscular (for prompt control of severe symptoms): Usual dosage is 1 mg to 2 mg (V2 to 1 mL) by deep intramuscular injection q4 to 6h, p.r.n.
 More than 6 mg within 24 hours is rarely necessary.
 Only in very exceptional cases should intramuscular dosage exceed 10 mg within 24 hours.
 These dosages are for children, ages 6 to 12, who are hospitalized or under close supervision.
 Oral: The starting dosage is 1 mg administered once a day or b.i.d.
 While it is usually not necessary to exceed dosages of 15 mg daily, some older children with severe symptoms may require higher dosages.
 However, if it is necessary to achieve rapid control of severe symptoms, 1 mg (V2 mL) of the drug may be administered intramuscularly once or twice a day.
 The recommended starting dose is 100 mg. STENDRA should be taken orally as needed as early as approximately 15 minutes before sexual activity.
 Based on individual efficacy and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 200 mg taken as early as approximately 15 minutes before sexual activity, or decreased to 50 mg taken approximately 30 minutes before sexual activity.
 If STENDRA is co - administered with an alpha - blocker, patients should be stable on alpha - blocker therapy prior to initiating treatment with STENDRA, and STENDRA should be initiated at the 50 mg dose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Stimate® Nasal Spray is administered by nasal insufflation, one spray per nostril, to provide a total dose of 300 mcg.
 In patients weighing less than 50 kg, 150 mcg administered as a single spray provided the expected effect on Factor VIII coagulant activity, Factor VIII ristocetin cofactor activity and skin bleeding time.
 The nasal spray pump can only deliver doses of 0.1 mL (150 mcg) or multiples of 0.1 mL.
 The bottle should be discarded after 25 doses since the amount delivered thereafter per spray may be substantially less than 150 mcg of drug.
 The recommended dose of STIOLTO RESPIMAT is two inhalations once - daily at the same time of the day.
 The recommended dose is 160 mg Stivarga (four 40 mg tablets) taken orally once daily for the first 21 days of each 28 - day cycle.
 Do not take two doses of Stivarga on the same day to make up for a missed dose from the previous day.
 Reduce the dose of Stivarga to 120 mg:
 Reduce the dose of Stivarga to 80 mg:
 Dosing of children and adolescents up to 70 kg body weight - STRATTERA should be initiated at a total daily dose of approximately 0.5 mg / kg and increased after a minimum of 3 days to a target total daily dose of approximately 1.2 mg / kg administered either as a single daily dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon / early evening.
 No additional benefit has been demonstrated for doses higher than 1.2 mg / kg / day [see Clinical Studies].
 The total daily dose in children and adolescents should not exceed 1.4 mg / kg or 100 mg, whichever is less.
 Dosing of children and adolescents over 70 kg body weight and adults - STRATTERA should be initiated at a total daily dose of 40 mg and increased after a minimum of 3 days to a target total daily dose of approximately 80 mg administered either as a single daily dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon / early evening.
 After 2 to 4 additional weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 100 mg in patients who have not achieved an optimal response.
 The maximum recommended total daily dose in children and adolescents over 70 kg and adults is 100 mg.
 The benefit of maintaining pediatric patients (ages 6 - 15 years) with ADHD on STRATTERA after achieving a response in a dose range of 1.2 to 1.8 mg / kg / day was demonstrated in a controlled trial.
 The safety of single doses over 120 mg and total daily doses above 150 mg have not been systematically evaluated.
 Dosing adjustment for hepatically impaired patients - For those ADHD patients who have hepatic insufficiency (HI), dosage adjustment is recommended as follows: For patients with moderate HI (Child - Pugh Class B), initial and target doses should be reduced to 50% of the normal dose (for patients without HI).
 For patients with severe HI (Child - Pugh Class C), initial dose and target doses should be reduced to 25% of normal [see Use In Specific Populations].
 Dosing adjustment for use with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or in patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs - In children and adolescents up to 70 kg body weight administered strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and quinidine, or in patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs, STRATTERA should be initiated at 0.5 mg / kg / day and only increased to the usual target dose of 1.2 mg / kg / day if symptoms fail to improve after 4 weeks and the initial dose is well tolerated.
 In children and adolescents over 70 kg body weight and adults administered strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and quinidine, STRATTERA should be initiated at 40 mg / day and only increased to the usual target dose of 80 mg / day if symptoms fail to improve after 4 weeks and the initial dose is well tolerated.
 The recommended dosage regimen of STRENSIQ for the treatment of perinatal / infantileonset HPP is 6 mg / kg per week administered subcutaneously as either:

 The recommended dosage regimen of STRENSIQ for the treatment of juvenile - onset HPP is 6 mg / kg per week administered subcutaneously as either:
 Table 1: Weight - Based Dosing for Administration of 2 mg / kg Three Times per Week
 Table 2: Weight - Based Dosing for Administration of 1 mg / kg Six Times per Week
 Table 3: Weight - Based Dosing for Administration of 3 mg / kg Three Times per Week - Only for Perinatal / Infantile - Onset HPP*
 A dose of 250,000 IU of Streptokinase infused into a peripheral vein over 30 minutes has been found appropriate in over 90% of patients.
 Instill 250,000 IU Streptokinase in 2 mL of solution into each occluded limb of the cannula slowly.
 For Use In Arteriovenous Cannulae:   Slowly reconstitute the contents of 250,000 IU Streptase, Streptokinase, vacuum - packed vial with 2 mL Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.
 Streptomycin is usually administered daily as a single intramuscular injection.
 A total dose of not more than 120 g over the course of therapy should be given unless there are no other therapeutic options.
 TULAREMIA: One to 2 g daily in divided doses for 7 to 14 days until the patient is afebrile for 5 to 7 days.
 PLAGUE: Two grams of streptomycin daily in two divided doses should be administered intramuscularly.
 For adults: 1 to 2 grams in divided doses every six to twelve hours for moderate to severe infections.
 Doses should generally not exceed 2 grams per day.
 For children: 20 to 40 mg / kg / day (8 to 20 mg / lb / day) in divided doses every 6 to 12 hours.
 The recommended dosage for Striant is the application of one buccal system (30 mg) to the gum region twice daily; morning and evening (about 12 hours apart).
 Striant therapy should be discontinued if serum testosterone concentrations are consistently outside of the normal range (300 to 1050 ng / dL) despite the use of one buccal system applied twice daily.
 STRIBILD is a four - drug fixed dose combination product containing 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 of cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and 300 mg of tenofovir DF.
 The recommended dosage of STRIBILD is one tablet taken orally once daily with food in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with a body weight at least 35 kg (at least 77 lbs) and creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 70 mL per minute [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Because STRIBILD is a fixed - dose combination tablet, STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute during treatment with STRIBILD, as the dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) cannot be achieved [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dose of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is two inhalations once - daily at the same time of the day.
 The recommended dosage of STROMECTOL (ivermectin) for the treatment of strongyloidiasis is a single oral dose designed to provide approximately 200 mcg of ivermectin per kg of body weight.
 The recommended dosage of STROMECTOL (ivermectin) for the treatment of onchocerciasis is a single oral dose designed to provide approximately 150 mcg of ivermectin per kg of body weight.
 In mass distribution campaigns in international treatment programs, the most commonly used dose interval is 12 months.
 50 mcg = 0.05 mg = 1 mL
 Usage in Children: For induction and maintenance in children 2 to 12 years of age, a reduced dose as low as 2 to 3 mcg / kg is recommended.
 When attenuation of the responses to surgical stress is especially important, doses of 50 to 100 mcg / kg (0.05 to 0.1 mg / kg) (1 to 2 mL / kg) may be administered with oxygen and a muscle relaxant.
 In certain cases, doses up to 150 mcg / kg (0.15 mg / kg) (3 mL / kg) may be necessary to produce this anesthetic effect.
 Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg / 0.5 mg or 4 mg / 1 mg buprenorphine / naloxone and may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2 - hour intervals, under supervision, to 8 mg / 2 mg buprenorphine / naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal symptoms.
 On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 16 mg / 4 mg SUBOXONE sublingual film is recommended.
 The dosage of SUBOXONE sublingual film from Day 3 onwards should be progressively adjusted in increments / decrements of 2 mg / 0.5 mg or 4 mg / 1 mg buprenorphine / naloxone to a level that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms.
 The recommended target dosage of SUBOXONE sublingual film during maintenance is 16 mg / 4 mg buprenorphine / naloxone / day as a single daily dose.
 2 mg / 0.5 mg, 4 mg / 1 mg, 8 mg / 2 mg and the 12 mg / 3 mg units, are different from one another.
 If patients switch between various combinations of lower and higher strength units of SUBOXONE sublingual films to obtain the same total dose, (e.g., from three 4 mg / 1 mg units to a single 12 mg / 3 mg unit, or vice - versa), systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone may be different and patients should be monitored for over - dosing or under - dosing.
 For this reason, pharmacist should not substitute one or more film strengths for another without approval of the prescriber.
 Initiate treatment with SUBSYS for all patients (including those switching from another fentanyl product) using ONE 100 mcg spray sublingually.
 Prescribe an initial titration supply of 100 mcg SUBSYS units, which limits the number of units in the home during titration.
 The initial dose of SUBSYS is always 100 mcg with the only exception of patients already using Actiq.
 If signs of excessive opioid effects appear following administration of a single SUBSYS dose, subsequent doses should be decreased.
 Generally, only increase the SUBSYS dose when a single administration of the current dose fails to adequately treat the breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes.
 SUBUTEX sublingual tablet is administered sublingually as a single daily dose.
 In a one - month study, patients received 8 mg of SUBUTEX sublingual tablet on Day 1 and 16 mg SUBUTEX sublingual tablet on Day 2.
 Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone ( > 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose.
 For doses requiring the use of more than two tablets, patients are advised to either place all the tablets at once or alternatively (if they cannot fit in more than two tablets comfortably), place two tablets at a time under the tongue.
 Both Suclear dosing regimens require administration of Suclear using one 6 - oz bottle of oral solution (containing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate) diluted with water to 16 - oz, followed by a 2 - L jug of powder (polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride) dissolved in water.
 Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids, as follows:

 (two full measuring scoops or 56 drops) per meal or snack for patients over 15 kg in body weight.
 Dosage may be measured with the 1 mL measuring scoop (provided) or by drop count method (1mL equals 28 drops from the SUCRAID container tip).
 SUFENTA (sufentanil citrate injection) may be administered intravenously by slow injection or infusion 1) in doses of up to 8 µg / kg as an analgesic adjunct to general anesthesia, and 2) in doses ≥ 8 µg / kg as a primary anesthetic agent for induction and maintenance of anesthesia (see Dosage Range Chart).
 Usage in Children: For induction and maintenance of anesthesia in children less than 12 years of age undergoing cardiovascular surgery, an anesthetic dose of 10 - 25 µg / kg administered with 100% oxygen is generally recommended.
 Therapy usually should be initiated with 17 mg orally once daily, then increased by 8.5 mg per week or longer intervals, to attain adequate control of blood pressure.
 Usual maintenance dosage is 17 to 34 mg once daily.
 Blood pressure response increases over the 8.5 - 34 mg daily dose range but adverse event rates also increase.
 Doses beyond 34 mg once daily are not recommended.
 A starting dose not exceeding 8.5 mg daily is recommended in these patient groups.
 Pre - measured quantities of 50 g of mafenide acetate powder are provided in sterile packets.

 The recommended dosage for prophylaxis in adults is 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily.8
 For children, the recommended dose is 750 mg / m² / day sulfamethoxazole with 150 mg / m² / day trimethoprim given orally in equally divided doses twice a day, on 3 consecutive days per week.
 The total daily dose should not exceed 1600 mg sulfamethoxazole and 320 mg trimethoprim.9 The following table is a guideline for the attainment of this dosage in children:
 For the treatment of travelers' diarrhea, the usual adult dosage is 4 teaspoonfuls (20 mL) of the suspension every 12 hours for 5 days.
 One full applicator intravaginally twice daily for four to six days.
 The maximum single recommended dose of Sumavel DosePro for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg given subcutaneously.
 For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, a lower dose (4 mg) may be used [see Clinical Studies].
 The maximum cumulative injected dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, with doses of Sumavel DosePro separated by at least 1 hour.
 Sumavel DosePro is available for use as 4 mg or 6 mg needle - free delivery systems.
 Adults: usual daily dose is 1 to 2 g: for mild to moderate infections: 500 mg bid or 250 mg qid; higher dosages such as 500 mg qid may be required for severe infections.
 For children above eight years of age: usual daily dose is 10 to 20 mg / lb (25 to 50 mg / kg) body weight divided in four equal doses.
 The treatment of brucellosis, 500 mg tetracycline four times daily for three weeks should be accompanied by streptomycin, 1 g intramuscularly twice daily the first week and once daily the second week.
 For treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea, 500 mg every six hours for seven days.
 For treatment of syphilis, a total of 30 to 40 g in equally divided doses over a period of 10 to 15 days should be given.
 Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: 500 mg by mouth, four times a day for at least seven days.
 In cases of severe acne which in the judgment of the clinician, requires long - term treatment, the recommended initial dosage is 1 g daily in divided doses.
 When improvement is noted, usually within one week, dosage should be gradually reduced to maintenance levels ranging from 125 to 500 mg daily.
 The recommended dose of SUPPRELIN LA is one implant every 12 months.
 Each implant contains 50 mg histrelin acetate.
 The implant is inserted subcutaneously in the inner aspect of the upper arm and provides continuous release of histrelin acetate (65 mcg / day) for 12 months of hormonal therapy.
 When fully inserted, the implant rests inside the cannula so that just the tip of the implant is visible at the beveled end of the cannula.
 During the maintenance of anesthesia with inflow rates of 2 L / min or more, the alveolar concentration of SUPRANE will usually be within 10% of the inspired concentration [FA / FI, see Figure 2 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 SUPRANE , with or without N2O, and halothane, with or without N2O were studied in three clinical trials of pediatric patients aged 2 weeks to 12 years (median 2 years) and ASA physical status I or II.
 Heart rate during maintenance of anesthesia is approximately 10 beats per minute faster with SUPRANE than with halothane.
 The recommended dose of cefixime is 400 mg daily.
 This may be given as a 400 mg tablet or capsule daily or the 400 mg tablet may be split and given as one half tablet every 12 hours.
 For the treatment of uncomplicated cervical / urethral gonococcal infections, a single oral dose of 400 mg is recommended.
 The recommended dose is 8 mg / kg / day of the suspension.
 This may be administered as a single daily dose or may be given in two divided doses, as 4 mg / kg every 12 hours.
 Ensure all orders that specify a dose in milliliters include a concentration, because SUPRAX for oral suspension is available in three different concentrations (100 mg / 5 mL, 200 mg / 5 mL, and 500 mg / 5 mL).
 Table 2: Doses for Adults with Renal Impairment
 The usual adult dose is one tablet as prescribed by the physician, administered in the morning, with or without food.
 The dose for colon cleansing requires administration of two bottles of SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit.
 Each bottle is administered as 16 ounces of diluted SUPREP solution with an additional 1 quart of water taken orally.
 The total volume of liquid required for colon cleansing (using two bottles) is 3 quarts (approximately 2.8 L) taken orally prior to the colonoscopy in the following way:
 The recommended dose of SURFAXIN is 5.8 mL per kg birth weight.
 Up to 4 doses of SURFAXIN can be administered in the first 48 hours of life.
 No information is available on doses greater than 5.8 mL per kg birth weight, the effects of more than 4 doses, or dosing more frequently than every 6 hours.
 Use aseptic technique to slowly draw up the appropriate amount of SURFAXIN into a single, appropriately sized syringe, depending on the total dose volume, using a 16 - or 18 - gauge needle.
 Instill the first aliquot of the dose (one - quarter of the total volume) as a bolus while continuing positive pressure mechanical ventilation and maintaining positive end - expiratory pressure of 4 to 5 cm H2O.
 It is not possible to prescribe a single dosage schedule of SURMONTIL that will be therapeutically effective in all patients.
 Initially, 75 mg / day in divided doses, increased to 150 mg / day.
 Dosages over 200 mg / day are not recommended.
 Maintenance therapy is in the range of 50 to 150 mg / day.
 Initially, 100 mg / day in divided doses.
 This may be increased gradually in a few days to 200 mg / day, depending upon individual response and tolerance.
 If improvement does not occur in 2 to 3 weeks, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 250 to 300 mg / day.
 Initially, a dose of 50 mg / day is recommended, with gradual increments up to 100 mg / day, depending upon patient response and tolerance.
 Maintenance therapy is preferably administered as a single dose at bedtime.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with SURMONTIL is unclear.
 Each dose of SURVANTA is 100 mg of phospholipids / kg birth weight (4 mL / kg).
 Four doses of SURVANTA can be administered in the first 48 hours of life.
 The dosage of SURVANTA for repeat doses is also 100 mg phospholipids / kg and is based on the infant's birth weight.
 Dose no sooner than 6 hours after the preceding dose if the infant remains intubated and requires at least 30% inspired oxygen to maintain a PaO2 less than or equal to 80 torr.
 The recommended dosage of SUSTIVA (efavirenz) is 600 mg orally, once daily, in combination with a protease inhibitor and / or nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
 If SUSTIVA is coadministered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose should be increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the SUSTIVA dose should be decreased to 300 mg once daily using the capsule formulation (one 200 mg and two 50 mg capsules or six 50 mg capsules).
 If SUSTIVA is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the dose of SUSTIVA to 800 mg once daily is recommended [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, Table 5 and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Table 8].
 Table 1 describes the recommended dose of SUSTIVA for pediatric patients 3 months of age or older and weighing between 3.5 kg and 40 kg [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dosage of SUSTIVA for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater is 600 mg once daily.
 For pediatric patients at least 3 months old and weighing at least 3.5 kg and adults who cannot swallow capsules or tablets, the capsule contents may be administered with a small amount (1 to 2 teaspoons) of food.
 For young infants receiving the capsule sprinkle - infant formula mixture, the entire capsule contents should be gently mixed into 2 teaspoons of reconstituted room temperature infant formula in a small container by carefully stirring with a small spoon, and then drawing up the mixture into a 10 mL oral dosing syringe for administration.
 The recommended dosage of SUSTOL is 10 mg administered subcutaneously.
 For patients receiving MEC, the recommended dexamethasone dosage is 8 mg intravenously on Day 1.
 For patients receiving AC combination chemotherapy regimens, the recommended dexamethasone dosage is 20 mg intravenously on Day 1, followed by 8 mg orally, twice a day, on Days 2, 3 and 4.
 The recommended dose of SUTENT for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one 50 mg oral dose taken once daily, on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off (Schedule 4 / 2).
 The recommended dose of SUTENT for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) is 37.5 mg taken orally once daily continuously without a scheduled off - treatment period.
 Dose interruption and / or dose modification in 12.5 mg increments or decrements is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability.
 The maximum dose administered in the Phase 3 pNET study was 50 mg daily.
 A dose reduction for SUTENT to a minimum of 37.5 mg (GIST and RCC) or 25 mg (pNET) daily should be considered if SUTENT must be co - administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 A dose increase for SUTENT to a maximum of 87.5 mg (GIST and RCC) or 62.5 mg (pNET) daily should be considered if SUTENT must be co - administered with a CYP3A4 inducer.
 Reconstitute SYLATRON with 0.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP.
 SYLVANT 11 mg / kg is given over 1 hour as an intravenous infusion administered every 3 weeks until treatment failure.
 SYMBICORT should be administered as 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart), every day by the orally inhaled route only.
 In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by shaking well before each spray and releasing two test sprays into the air away from the face.
 For patients 12 years of age and older, the dosage is 2 inhalations of SYMBICORT 80 / 4.5 or SYMBICORT 160 / 4.5 twice daily.
 The maximum recommended dosage in adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older is SYMBICORT 160 / 4.5, two inhalations twice daily.

 For patients with COPD the recommended dose is SYMBICORT 160 / 4.5, two inhalations twice daily.
 Administer SYMBYAX once daily in the evening, generally beginning with the 6 mg / 25 mg (mg olanzapine / mg equivalent fluoxetine) capsule.
 Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with SYMBYAX in a dose range of olanzapine 6 mg to 12 mg and fluoxetine 25 mg to 50 mg [see Clinical Studies].
 The safety of doses above 18 mg of olanzapine and 75 mg of fluoxetine has not been evaluated in adult clinical studies.
 Administer SYMBYAX once daily in the evening, generally beginning with the 3 mg / 25 mg capsule, without regard to meals, with a recommended target dose within the approved dosing range (6 / 25; 6 / 50; 12 / 25; 12 / 50 mg) [see Clinical Studies].
 The safety of doses above 12 mg of olanzapine and 50 mg of fluoxetine has not been evaluated in pediatric clinical studies.
 Administer SYMBYAX once daily in the evening, generally beginning with the 6 mg / 25 mg capsule.
 Antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated with SYMBYAX in a dose range of olanzapine 6 mg to 18 mg and fluoxetine 25 mg to 50 mg [see Clinical Studies].
 Start SYMBYAX at 3 mg / 25 mg or 6 mg / 25 mg in patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, patients with hepatic impairment, or patients who exhibit a combination of factors that may slow the metabolism of SYMBYAX (female gender, geriatric age, nonsmoking status) or those patients who may be pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with SYMBYAX is unclear.
 SYMLIN dosage differs depending on whether the patient has type 1 or type 2 diabetes [see Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Using Mealtime Insulin and Patients with Type 1 Diabetes below].
 Increase the SYMLIN dose from 60 to 120 mcg prior to each major meal when no clinically significant nausea has occurred for at least 3 days.
 If significant nausea persists at the 120 mcg dose, the SYMLIN dose should be decreased to 60 mcg.
 Increase the SYMLIN dose to the next increment (30, 45, or 60 mcg) when no clinically significant nausea has occurred for at least 3 days.
 If significant nausea persists at the 45 or 60 mcg dose level, the SYMLIN dose should be decreased to 30 mcg.
 SYMLIN should be administered subcutaneously immediately prior to each major meal ( ≥ 250 kcal or containing ≥ 30 grams of carbohydrate).
 The adult daily dosage of SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) is 200 mg; two 100 mg tablets (or four teaspoonfuls of syrup) as a single daily dose.
 The daily dosage may be split into one tablet of 100 mg (or two teaspoonfuls of syrup) twice a day.
 In persons 65 years of age or older, the daily dosage of SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) is 100 mg.
 A 100 mg daily dose has also been shown in experimental challenge studies to be effective as prophylaxis in healthy adults who are not at high risk for influenza - related complications.
 However, it has not been demonstrated that a 100 mg daily dose is as effective as a 200 mg daily dose for prophylaxis, nor has the 100 mg daily dose been studied in the treatment of acute influenza illness.
 In recent clinical trials, the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with the 100 mg daily dose was at or near the level of placebo.
 The 100 mg dose is recommended for persons who have demonstrated intolerance to 200 mg of SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) daily because of CNS or other toxicities.
 The total daily dose should be calculated on the basis of 2 to 4 mg / lb / day (4.4 to 8.8 mg / kg / day), but not to exceed 150 mg per day.
 The total daily dose is 200 mg given as one tablet of 100 mg (or two teaspoonfuls of syrup) twice a day.
 The 100 mg daily dose has not been studied in this pediatric population.
 Therefore, there are no data which demonstrate that this dose is as effective as or is safer than the 200 mg daily dose in this patient population.
 The usual dose of SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) is 100 mg twice a day when used alone.
 The initial dose of SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) is 100 mg daily for patients with serious associated medical illnesses or who are receiving high doses of other antiparkinson drugs.
 After one to several weeks at 100 mg once daily, the dose may be increased to 100 mg twice daily, if necessary.
 Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 400 mg daily in divided doses.
 Benefit may be regained by increasing the dose to 300 mg daily.
 SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) should be held constant at 100 mg daily or twice daily while the daily dose of levodopa is gradually increased to optimal benefit.
 The usual dose of SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) is 100 mg twice a day.
 Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with SYMMETREL (amantadine hydrochloride) at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 300 mg daily in divided doses.
 The recommended dosage for patients on hemodialysis is 200 mg every 7 days.
 The recommended dose of Synagis is 15 mg per kg of body weight given monthly by intramuscular injection.
 The efficacy of Synagis at doses less than 15 mg per kg, or of dosing less frequently than monthly throughout the RSV season, has not been established.
 The usual adult dose is two capsules every 4 hours as needed for pain.
 For the treatment of central precocious puberty (CPP), the recommended daily dose of SYNAREL is 1600 μg.
 The dose can be in creased to 1800 μg daily if adequate suppression cannot be achieved at 1600 μg / day.
 The 1600 μg dose is achieved by two sprays (400 μg) into each nostril in the morning (4 sprays) and two sprays into each nostril in the evening (4 sprays), a total of 8 sprays per day.
 The 1800 μg dose is achieved by 3 sprays (600 μg) into alternating nostrils three times a day, a total of 9 sprays per day.
 At 1600 μg / day, a bottle of SYNAREL provides about a 7 - day supply (about 56 sprays).
 For the management of endometriosis, the recommended daily dose of SYNAREL is 400 μg.
 This is achieved by one spray (200 μg) into one nostril in the morning and one spray into the other nostril in the evening.
 For these patients with persistent regular menstruation after 2 months of treatment, the dose of SYNAREL may be increased to 800 μg daily.
 The 800 μg dose is administered as one spray into each nostril in the morning (a total of two sprays) and again in the evening.
 The recommended duration of administration is six months.
 At 400 μg / day, a bottle of SYNAREL provides a 30 - day (about 60 sprays) supply.
 The recommended adult starting dosage of SYNDROS is 2.1 mg orally twice daily, one hour before lunch and one hour before dinner.
 In elderly patients, consider initiating SYNDROS at 2.1 mg once daily one hour before dinner or at bedtime to reduce the risk of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations].
 If CNS adverse reactions are severe or persistent, reduce the dose to 2.1 mg once daily one hour before dinner or in the evening at bedtime.
 The recommended starting dosage of SYNDROS is 4.2 mg / m²orally administered 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for a total of 4 to 6 doses per day.
 In elderly patients, consider initiating SYNDROS at 2.1 mg / m² once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations].
 Monitor patients for adverse reactions and consider decreasing the dose to 2.1 mg once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS adverse reactions.
 However, application of one additional patch at a new location to facilitate venous access is acceptable after a failed attempt.
 The recommended dosage for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections is 7.5 mg / kg q12h.
 The minimum recommended treatment duration for complicated skin and skin structure infections is seven days.
 Pediatric Patients: The recommended dose of Synercid for pediatric patients (12 to < 18 years of age) is 7.5 mg / kg q12h.
 Before Reconstitution : The unopened vials should be stored in a refrigerator at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).
 Stability of the diluted solution prior to the infusion is established as 5 hours at room temperature or 54 hours if stored under refrigeration 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).
 The recommended starting schedule for induction is 1.25 mg / m²administered subcutaneously twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days, over a 28 - day cycle.
 The recommended maintenance schedule is 1.25 mg / m²administered subcutaneously twice daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days, over a 28 - day cycle.
 If a patient experiences Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 0.5 x 109 / L) or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 50 x 109 / L) during a cycle, delay starting the next cycle until ANC is greater than or equal to 1.0 x 109 / L and platelet count is greater than or equal to 50 x 109 / L.
 Reconstitute SYNRIBO with one mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, prior to subcutaneous injection.
 The resulting solution will contain 3.5 mg / mL SYNRIBO.
 Use SYNRIBO within 12 hours of reconstitution when stored at room temperature and within 24 hours of reconstitution if stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).
 SYNTHROID is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one - half to one - hour before breakfast.
 The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg / kg / day (e.g., 100 - 125 mcg / day for a 70 kg adult).
 Older patients may require less than 1 mcg / kg / day.
 Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg / day are seldom required.
 An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg / day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and / or drug interactions.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day , with gradual dose increments at 4 - 6 week intervals.
 In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day with increases of 25 mcg / day every 2 - 4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10 - 15 mcg / kg / day .
 A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg / day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4 - 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment.
 In infants with very low (< 5 mcg / dL) or undetectable serum T4 concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium.
 However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2 - 4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.
 If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg / kg / day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level.
 Generally, TSH is suppressed to < 0.1 mU / L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg / kg / day.
 In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1 to either 0.5 or 1.0 mU / L) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer.
 SYNVISC (hylan g - f 20) is administered by intra - articular injection once a week (one week apart) for a total of three injections.
 SYNVISC (hylan g - f 20) is administered by intra - articular injection once a week (one week apart) for a total of three injections.
 Inject the full 2 mL in one knee only.
 Synvisc - One has an elasticity (storage modulus G') at 2.5 Hz of 111 ± 13 Pascals (Pa) and a viscosity (loss modulus G“) of 25 ± 2 Pa (elasticity and viscosity of knee synovial fluid of 18 to 27 - year - old humans measured with a comparable method at 2.5 Hz: G' = 117 ± 13 Pa; G” = 45 ± 8 Pa.)
 Each 10 mL syringe of Synvisc - One combines the three 2 - mL doses (16 mg each) of a complete SYNVISC treatment regimen (48 mg).
 However, on limited clinical experience, the recommended initial dose of SYPRINE is 500 - 750 mg / day for pediatric patients and 750 - 1250 mg / day for adults given in divided doses two, three or four times daily.
 This may be increased to a maximum of 2000 mg / day for adults or 1500 mg / day for pediatric patients age 12 or under.
 Remission was maintained with daily thioguanine, 4 - day pulses of cytarabine and cyclophosphamide, and a single dose of vincristine every 28 days.
 The median duration of remission was 11.5 months.8
 On those occasions when single - agent chemotherapy with thioguanine may be appropriate, the usual initial dosage for pediatric patients and adults is approximately 2 mg / kg of body weight per day.
 If, after 4 weeks on this dosage, there is no clinical improvement and no leukocyte or platelet depression, the dosage may be cautiously increased to 3 mg / kg / day.
 The maximum weekly dose should not exceed 100 g. Treatment of more than 30% body surface area is not recommended.
 Patients 18 years and older should not use more than 100 g per week and patients 12 to 17 years should not use more than 60 g per week.
 Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with TAFINLAR as a single agent [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended dosage regimen of TAFINLAR is 150 mg orally taken twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart as a single agent or with trametinib.
 The recommended dose of TAGRISSO is 80 mg tablet once a day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 Disperse tablet in 60 mL (2 ounces) of non - carbonated water only.
 Rinse the container with 120 mL to 240 mL (4 to 8 ounces) of water and immediately drink.
 If administration via naso - gastric tube is required, disperse the tablet as above in 15 mL of noncarbonated water, and then use an additional 15 mL of water to transfer any residues to the syringe.
 The resulting 30 mL liquid should be administered as per the nasogastric tube instructions with appropriate water flushes (approximately 30 mL).
 If concurrent use is unavoidable, increase TAGRISSO dosage to 160 mg daily when coadministering with a strong CYP3A inducer.
 The usual adult dose is 1 caplet every 4 hours as needed for pain relief, up to a maximum of 6 caplets per day.
 The recommended dose is 160 mg (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, followed by 80 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then 80 mg every 4 weeks.
 There are two presentations for TALTZ (i.e., autoinjector and prefilled syringe).
 Instruct patients using the autoinjector or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount (1 mL), which provides 80 mg of TALTZ, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use].
 The usual adult dose is 2 caplets three or four times a day.
 The recommended single parenteral dose is 30 mg by intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous route.
 Doses in excess of 30 mg intravenously or 60 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously are not recommended.
 Total daily dosage should not exceed 360 mg.
 A single, intramuscular 30 mg dose has been most commonly administered.
 An intravenous 20 mg dose has given adequate pain relief to some patients in labor when contractions become regular, and this dose may be given two or three times at two - to three - hour intervals, as needed.
 The recommended single parenteral dose as premedication for sedation is 0.5 mg / kg by intramuscular route.
 The usual initial adult dose is 1 tablet every three or four hours.
 This may be increased to 2 tablets when needed.
 Total daily dosage should not exceed 12 tablets.
 Flecainide has a long half - life (12 to 27 hours in patients).
 For patients with PSVT and patients with PAF the recommended starting dose is 50 mg every 12 hours.
 TAMBOCOR (flecainide) doses may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved.
 For PAF patients, a substantial increase in efficacy without a substantial increase in discontinuations for adverse experiences may be achieved by increasing the TAMBOCOR (flecainide) dose from 50 to 100 mg bid.
 The maximum recommended dose for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias is 300 mg / day.
 For sustained VT the recommended starting dose is 100 mg every 12 hours.
 This dose may be increased in increments of 50 mg bid every four days until efficacy is achieved.
 Most patients with sustained VT do not require more than 150 mg every 12 hours (300 mg / day) and the maximum dose recommended is 400 mg / day.
 Under six months of age, the initial starting dose of TAMBOCOR (flecainide) in children is approximately 50 mg / M² body surface area daily, divided into two or three equally spaced doses.
 Over six months of age, the initial starting dose may be increased to 100 mg / M2 per day.
 The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg / M² per day.
 The usual therapeutic level of flecainide in children is 200 - 500 ng / mL.
 In some cases, levels as high as 800 ng / mL may be required for control.
 In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 35 mL / min / 1.73 square meters or less), the initial dosage should be 100 mg once daily (or 50 mg bid); when used in such patients, frequent plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage adjustments (see Plasma Level Monitoring).
 In patients with less severe renal disease, the initial dosage should be 100 mg every 12 hours; plasma level monitoring may also be useful in these patients during dosage adjustment.
 Based on theoretical considerations, rather than experimental data, the following suggestion is made: when transferring patients from another antiarrhythmic drug to TAMBOCOR (flecainide) allow at least two to four plasma half - lives to elapse for the drug being discontinued before starting TAMBOCOR (flecainide) at the usual dosage.
 The large majority of patients successfully treated with TAMBOCOR (flecainide) were found to have trough plasma levels between 0.2 and 1.0 μg / mL.
 During emergency situations and when neither the oral suspension or the age - appropriate strengths of TAMIFLU capsules to mix with sweetened liquids are available, then a pharmacist may prepare an emergency supply of oral suspension from TAMIFLU 75 mg capsules [see Emergency Preparation of Oral Suspension from 75 mg TAMIFLU Capsules].
 The recommended oral dosage of TAMIFLU for treatment of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg twice daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension twice daily) for 5 days.
 Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of TAMIFLU for treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks of age through 12 years of age and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension.
 The recommended dosage of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak.
 Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension.
 Table 2 displays the dosage recommendations for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in adults with various stages of renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of less than or equal to 90 mL per minute).
 Dosage modifications are recommended in adults with an estimated creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL per minute [see Use in Specific Population and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The following emergency preparation instructions will provide one patient with enough TAMIFLU for a 5 - day course of treatment of influenza or a 10 - day course of prophylaxis of influenza:
 Table 3 : Emergency Preparation: Volume of Prepared Oral Suspension (6 mg per mL) Based Upon TAMIFLU Dose
 Step #2: Preparation must be performed with only one of the following vehicles (other vehicles have not been studied): Cherry Syrup (Humco®), Ora - Sweet® SF (sugar - free) (Paddock Laboratories), or simple syrup.
 Determine the number of capsules and the amount of water and vehicle needed to prepare the total volume (see Table 3) of prepared oral suspension (6 mg per mL) for a complete treatment or prophylaxis course (see Table 4).
 Table 4 : Emergency Preparation: Number of TAMIFLU 75 mg Capsules and Amount of Water and Vehicle Needed to Prepare the Total Volume of a Prepared Oral Suspension (6 mg per mL)
 Step #3: Follow the instructions below for preparing the 75 mg TAMIFLU capsules to produce the oral suspension (6 mg per mL):
 The recommended dosage of TANZEUM is 30 mg once weekly given as a subcutaneous injection in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm region.
 The dosage may be increased to 50 mg once weekly if the glycemic response is inadequate.
 It is acceptable to inject TANZEUM and insulin in the same body region but the injections should not be adjacent to each other.
 Adults: 250 to 500 mg 4 times a day
 Children: 125 to 250 mg (3 - 5 mg / lb or 6.6 to 11 mg / kg) every 6 hours
 The total daily dosage is usually given in 3 divided doses at approximately 8 - hour intervals.
 The initial daily dosage is 15 mg for mild hyperthyroidism, 30 to 40 mg for moderately severe hyperthyroidism, and 60 mg for severe hyperthyroidism, divided into 3 doses at 8 - hour intervals.
 The maintenance dosage is 5 to 15 mg daily.
 Initially, the daily dosage is 0.4 mg / kg of body weight divided into 3 doses and given at 8 - hour intervals.
 Select patients for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with TARCEVA based on the presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in tumor or plasma specimens [See Clinical Studies].
 The recommended daily dose of TARCEVA for NSCLC is 150 mg taken on an empty stomach, i.e., at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food.
 The recommended daily dose of TARCEVA for pancreatic cancer is 100 mg taken once daily in combination with gemcitabine.
 A single dose of TARGINIQ ER greater than 40 mg / 20 mg or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg / 40 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established.
 Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine / day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl / hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone / day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone / day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone / day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Initiate treatment with TARGINIQ ER with one 10 mg / 5 mg tablet orally every 12 hours.
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is TARGINIQ ER 10 mg / 5 mg orally every 12 hours.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Consider the following when using the information in Table 1 and Table 2:
 Example conversion from a single opioid to TARGINIQ ER: Step 1: A patient receiving oxymorphone at a total daily dose of 10 mg would equate to an Equivalent Daily Oral Morphine Dose of 40 mg (10 mg x 4; Table 1).
 Step 2: Based on Table 2, the starting dose is TARGINIQ ER 10 mg / 5 mg every 12 hours.
 Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative dose, approximately 10 mg / 5 mg every 12 hours of TARGINIQ ER, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch.
 For patients receiving transdermal buprenorphine ( ≤ 20 mcg / hr), the recommended starting dose is TARGINIQ ER 10 mg / 5 mg every 12 hours.
 The total daily dose of TARGINIQ ER should not exceed 80 mg / 40 mg (40 mg / 20 mg q12h).
 The highest total daily dose of TARGINIQ ER studied in the main clinical program is 80 mg / 40 mg (40 mg / 20 mg twice daily).
 Total daily doses above 80 mg / 40 mg have not been studied sufficiently to ensure patient safety and may be associated with symptoms of opioid withdrawal or decreased analgesia.
 When administering TARGINIQ ER to patients with mild hepatic impairment, reduce the dose to 1 / 3 to ½ the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended initial dose of Targretin® (bexarotene) capsules is 300 mg / m2 / day.
 Targretin® (bexarotene) capsules should be taken as a single oral daily dose with a meal.
 Dose Modification Guidelines: The 300 mg / m2 / day dose level of Targretin® (bexarotene) capsules may be adjusted to 200 mg / m2 / day then to 100 mg / m2 / day, or temporarily suspended, if necessitated by toxicity.
 If there is no tumor response after eight weeks of treatment and if the initial dose of 300 mg / m2 / day is well tolerated, the dose may be escalated to 400 mg / m2 / day with careful monitoring.
 The recommended usual dosage range of trandolapril for hypertension is 1 to 4 mg per day administered in a single dose or two divided doses.
 The recommended usual dosage range of Isoptin - SR for hypertension is 120 to 480 mg per day administered in a single dose or two divided doses.
 To minimize dose - independent hazards, it is usually appropriate to begin therapy with TARKA only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with one or the other monotherapy at its respective maximally recommended dose and shortest dosing interval, or (b) the dose of one or the other monotherapy cannot be increased further because of dose - limiting side effects.
 The antihypertensive effect and or adverse effects of adding 4 mg of trandolapril once - a - day to a dose of 240 mg Isoptin - SR administered twice - a - day has not been studied, nor have the effects of adding as little of 180 mg Isoptin - SR to 2 mg trandolapril administered twice - a - day been evaluated.
 Over the dose range of Isoptin - SR 120 to 240 mg once - a - day and trandolapril 0.5 to 8 mg once - a - day, the effects of the combination increase with increasing doses of either component.
 For convenience, patients receiving trandolapril (up to 8 mg) and verapamil (up to 240 mg) in separate tablets, administered once - a - day, may instead wish to receive tablets of TARKA containing the same component doses.
 The recommended dose of Tasigna is 300 mg orally twice daily [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of Tasigna (nilotinib) is 400 mg orally twice daily [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 If other clinically significant moderate or severe non - hematologic toxicity develops, withhold dosing, and resume at 400 mg once daily when the toxicity has resolved.
 If clinically appropriate, escalation of the dose back to 300 mg (newly diagnosed Ph+ CML - CP) or 400 mg (resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML - CP and CMLAP) twice daily should be considered.
 For Grade 3 to 4 lipase elevations, dosing should be withheld, and may be resumed at 400 mg once daily.
 For Grade 3 to 4 bilirubin or hepatic transaminase elevations, dosing should be withheld, and may be resumed at 400 mg once daily.
 If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, based on pharmacokinetic studies, consider a dose reduction to 300 mg once daily in patients with resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML or to 200 mg once daily in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML - CP.
 TASMAR therapy should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of liver disease or two SGPT / ALT or SGOT / AST values greater than the upper limit of normal.
 The initial dose of TASMAR is always 100 mg three times per day.
 The recommended daily dose of TASMAR is also 100 mg tid.
 In clinical trials, elevations in ALT occurred more frequently at the dose of 200 mg tid.
 While it is unknown whether the risk of acute fulminant liver failure is increased at the 200 - mg dose, it would be prudent to use 200 mg only if the anticipated incremental clinical benefit is justified (see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).
 In clinical trials, the majority of patients required a decrease in their daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa was > 600 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesias before beginning treatment.
 (Greater than 70% of patients with levodopa doses above 600 mg daily required such a reduction.)
 TASMAR therapy should not be initiated in any patient with liver disease or two SGPT / ALT or SGOT / AST values greater than the upper limit of normal.
 The safety of tolcapone has not been examined in subjects who had creatinine clearance less than 25 mL / min (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 As the duration of COMT inhibition with TASMAR is generally 5 to 6 hours on average, decreasing the frequency of dosage to twice or once a day may not in itself prevent withdrawal effects.
 Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before TAXOL, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to TAXOL, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) IV 30 to 60 minutes before TAXOL.
 For patients with non - small cell lung carcinoma, the recommended regimen, given every 3 weeks, is TAXOL administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg / m2 followed by cisplatin, 75 mg / m2.
 For patients with AIDS - related Kaposi's sarcoma, TAXOL administered at a dose of 135 mg / m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks or at a dose of 100 mg / m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 2 weeks is recommended (dose intensity 45 - 50 mg / m2 / week).
 In addition, all patients with low performance status were treated with the latter schedule (100 mg / m2 every 2 weeks).
 Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil < 500 cells / mm3 for a week or longer) or severe peripheral neuropathy during TAXOL therapy should have dosage reduced by 20% for subsequent courses of TAXOL.
 Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration (see PRECAUTIONS: Injection Site Reaction).
 TAXOL should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in Ringer's Injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg / mL.
 No significant losses in potency have been noted following simulated delivery of the solution through IV tubing containing an in - line (0.22 micron) filter.
 All patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids (see below for prostate cancer) such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g., 8 mg twice daily) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to TAXOTERE administration in order to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 For hormone - refractory metastatic prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, at 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the TAXOTERE infusion [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Patients who are dosed initially at 100 mg / m² and who experience either febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³ for more than 1 week, or severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions during TAXOTERE therapy should have the dosage adjusted from 100 mg / m² to 75 mg / m².
 If the patient continues to experience these reactions, the dosage should either be decreased from 75 mg / m² to 55 mg / m² or the treatment should be discontinued.
 Conversely, patients who are dosed initially at 60 mg / m² and who do not experience febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³ for more than 1 week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions, or severe peripheral neuropathy during TAXOTERE therapy may tolerate higher doses.
 TAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells / mm³ .
 Patients who continue to experience this reaction should remain on G - CSF and have their TAXOTERE dose reduced to 60 mg / m².
 Patients who experience grade 3 or 4 stomatitis should have their TAXOTERE dose decreased to 60 mg / m².
 Patients who experience severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or moderate neurosensory signs and / or symptoms during TAXOTERE therapy should have their dosage of TAXOTERE reduced from 75 mg / m² to 60 mg / m².
 Patients who are dosed initially at 75 mg / m² and who experience either febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³ for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions, or other grade 3 / 4 non - hematological toxicities during TAXOTERE treatment should have treatment withheld until resolution of the toxicity and then resumed at 55 mg / m².
 For patients who are dosed initially at TAXOTERE 75 mg / m² in combination with cisplatin, and whose nadir of platelet count during the previous course of therapy is < 25,000 cells / mm³, in patients who experience febrile neutropenia, and in patients with serious non - hematologic toxicities, the TAXOTERE dosage in subsequent cycles should be reduced to 65 mg / m² .
 In patients who require a further dose reduction, a dose of 50 mg / m² is recommended.
 TAXOTERE should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥ 1,500 cells / mm³ .
 Patients who experience either febrile neutropenia, neutrophils < 500 cells / mm³ for more than one week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions or moderate neurosensory signs and / or symptoms during TAXOTERE therapy should have the dosage of TAXOTERE reduced from 75 mg / m² to 60 mg / m².
 If an episode of febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection occurs despite G - CSF use, the TAXOTERE dose should be reduced from 75 mg / m² to 60 mg / m² .
 If subsequent episodes of complicated neutropenia occur the TAXOTERE dose should be reduced from 60 mg / m² to 45 mg / m² .
 In case of grade 4 thrombocytopenia the TAXOTERE dose should be reduced from 75 mg / m² to 60 mg / m².
 Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of TAXOTERE until neutrophils recover to a level > 1,500 cells / mm³ and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells / mm³ .
 Liver dysfunction: In case of AST / ALT > 2.5 to ≤ 5 x ULN and AP ≤ 2.5 x ULN, or AST / ALT > 1.5 to ≤ 5 x ULN and AP > 2.5 to ≤ 5 x ULN, TAXOTERE should be reduced by 20%.
 In case of AST / ALT > 5 x ULN and / or AP > 5 x ULN TAXOTERE should be stopped.
 Nephrotoxicity: In the event of a rise in serum creatinine ≥ grade 2 ( > 1.5 x normal value) despite adequate rehydration, CrCl should be determined before each subsequent cycle and the following dose reductions should be considered (see Table 2).
 TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate (20 mg / mL) requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution.
 Use only a 21 gauge needle to withdraw TAXOTERE from the vial because larger bore needles (e.g., 18 and 19 gauge) may result in stopper coring and rubber particulates.
 The usual adult dosage is 1 gram administered intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 to 12 hours.
 Therefore, in patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 50 mL / min), it is recommended that the dosage of ceftazidime be reduced to compensate for its slower excretion.
 In patients with suspected renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram of ceftazidime may be given.
 In patients with severe infections who would normally receive 6 grams of Tazicef daily were it not for renal insufficiency, the unit dose given in the table above may be increased by 50% or the dosing frequency may be increased appropriately.
 In patients undergoing hemodialysis, a loading dose of 1 gram is recommended, followed by 1 gram after each hemodialysis period.
 In such patients, a loading dose of 1 gram of Tazicef may be given, followed by 500 mg every 24 hours.
 In addition to IV use, Tazicef can be incorporated in the dialysis fluid at a concentration of 250 mg for 2 L of dialysis fluid.
 For IM administration, Tazicef should be reconstituted with one of the following diluents: Sterile Water for Injection, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, or 0.5% or 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection.
 Slowly inject directly into the vein over a period of 3 to 5 minutes or give through the tubing of an administration set while the patient is also receiving one of the compatible IV fluids (see Compatibility And Stability).
 For IV infusion, reconstitute the 1 - gram or 2 - gram vial and add an appropriate quantity of the resulting solution to an IV container with one of the compatible IV fluids listed under the COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY section.
 However, during infusion of a solution containing ceftazidime, it is desirable to discontinue the other solution.

 Apply TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel) Gel once a day, in the evening, to psoriatic lesions, using enough (2 mg / cm²) to cover only the lesion with a thin film to no more than 20% of body surface area.
 After the skin is dry, apply a thin film of TAZORAC® (tazarotene gel) Gel 0.1% (2 mg / cm²) once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear.
 Apply a thin film (2 mg / cm²) of TAZORAC® Cream once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions.
 After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg / cm²) of TAZORAC® Cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear.
 The recommended dose of TECENTRIQ is 1200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 The starting dose for TECFIDERA is 120 mg twice a day orally.
 After 7 days, the dose should be increased to the maintenance dose of 240 mg twice a day orally.
 Temporary dose reductions to 120 mg twice a day may be considered for individuals who do not tolerate the maintenance dose.
 Within 4 weeks, the recommended dose of 240 mg twice a day should be resumed.
 Alternatively, administration of non - enteric coated aspirin (up to a dose of 325 mg) 30 minutes prior to TECFIDERA dosing may reduce the incidence or severity of flushing [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 For imaging the urinary bladder and ureters (direct isotopic cystography), the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is administered by direct instillation aseptically into the bladder via a urethral catheter, following which the catheter is flushed with approximately 200 mL of sterile saline directly into the bladder.
 The suggested dose range employed for various diagnostic indications in the average ADULT PATIENT (70kg) is:
 Do not use an eluate of the TECHNELITE®, Technetium Tc 99m Generator later than one (1) working day after elution (12 hours).
 The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average ADULT and Pediatric patient from an intravenous injection of a maximum dose of 1110MBq (30 millicuries) of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection distributed uniformly in the total body are shown in Tables 5 and 6.
 To obtain radiation absorbed dose in rads (30 mCi dose) from the above table, divide individual organ values by a factor of 10 (does not apply for effective dose).
 Table 7: Absorbed Radiation Dose from DacryoscintigraphyUsing Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m
 In pediatric patients, an average 30 minute exposure to 37MBq (1 millicurie) of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection following instillation for direct cystography, results in an estimated absorbed radiation dose shown in Table 8.
 The recommended dosage of TECHNIVIE is two tablets taken orally once daily (in the morning).
 When administered with TECHNIVIE, the recommended dosage of RBV is based on weight: 1000 mg per day for subjects less than 75 kg and 1200 mg per day for those weighing at least 75 kg, divided and administered twice - daily with food.
 Table 1 shows the recommended TECHNIVIE treatment regimen and duration for HCV genotype 4 patients without cirrhosis.
 The recommended dosage of Teflaro is 600 mg administered every 12 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 to 60 minutes in patients ≥ 18 years of age.
 The contents of Teflaro vial should be constituted with 20 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP; or 0.9% of sodium chloride injection (normal saline); or 5% of dextrose injection; or lactated ringer's injection.
 The constituted solution must be further diluted in a range between 50 mL to 250 mL before intravenous infusion into patients.
 If sterile water for injection was used earlier, then appropriate infusion solutions include: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline); 5% Dextrose
 Preparation of 600 mg of Teflaro dose in 50 mL infusion bag: Withdraw 20 mL of diluent from the infusion bag.
 Proceed to inject entire content of the Teflaro vial into the bag to provide a total volume of 50 mL.
 The resultant concentration is approximately 12 mg / mL.
 Preparation of 400 mg of Teflaro dose in 50 mL infusion bag: Withdraw 20 mL of diluent from the infusion bag.
 Proceed to inject entire content of the Teflaro vial into the bag to provide a total volume of 50 mL.
 The resultant concentration is approximately 8 mg / mL.
 Solutions of Teflaro in concentrations ranging from 4 to 12 mg / mL in Baxter Mini - Bag Plus containers with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection may be stored for up to 6 hours at room temperature or for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).
 Stability testing in the Baxter Mini - Bag Plus has solely been conducted on 50 mL and 100 mL containers (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection).
 Studies have shown that the constituted solution in the infusion bag should be used within 6 hours when stored at room temperature or within 24 hours when stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8° C (36 to 46° F).

 Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg / kg.
 On the first day, either 100 mg b.i.d.
 for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg.
 This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg / day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours for tablets or XR tablets, or 50 mg (½ teaspoon) q.i.d.
 Do not exceed 1200 mg daily.
 Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400 to 800 mg daily.
 However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily.
 The recommended initial once - daily dose of Tekamlo is 150 mg / 5 mg. Titrate as needed to a maximum of 300 mg / 10 mg.
 If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, titrate the dose to a maximum of Tekamlo 300 mg / 10 mg once daily.
 Switch patients receiving aliskiren and amlodipine besylate from separate tablets to a single tablet of Tekamlo containing the same component doses.
 When substituting for individual components, increase the dose of one or both of the components if blood pressure control has not been satisfactory.
 The usual recommended starting dose of Tekturna is 150 mg once daily.
 In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled, the daily dose may be increased to 300 mg. Doses above 300 mg did not give an increased blood pressure response but resulted in an increased rate of diarrhea.
 The recommended once - daily doses of Tekturna HCT in order of increasing mean effect are 150 / 12.5 mg, 150 / 25 mg or 300 / 12.5 mg, and 300 / 25 mg.
 If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of aliskiren 300 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg.
 The usual recommended starting dose is 150 / 12.5 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure.
 The dose may be titrated up to a maximum of aliskiren 300 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily.
 The usual recommended starting dose is 150 / 12.5 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure.
 The dose may be titrated up to a maximum of aliskiren 300 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily.
 Concomitant Phase: TEMODAR is administered at 75 mg / m² daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions) followed by maintenance TEMODAR for 6 cycles.
 The TEMODAR dose should be continued throughout the 42 - day concomitant period up to 49 days if all of the following conditions are met: absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5 x 109 / L, platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 109 / L, common toxicity criteria (CTC) nonhematological toxicity less than or equal to Grade 1 (except for alopecia, nausea, and vomiting).
 Dosage in Cycle 1 (maintenance) is 150 mg / m² once daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without treatment.
 Cycles 2 - 6: At the start of Cycle 2, the dose can be escalated to 200 mg / m², if the CTC nonhematologic toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade less than or equal to 2 (except for alopecia, nausea, and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than or equal to 1.5 x 109 / L, and the platelet count is greater than or equal to 100 x 109 / L.
 The dose remains at 200 mg / m² per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs.
 During treatment, a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose of TEMODAR) or within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until the ANC is above 1.5 x 109 / L (1500 / μL) and the platelet count exceeds 100 x 109 / L (100,000 / μL).
 For adults the initial dose is 150 mg / m² once daily for 5 consecutive days per 28 - day treatment cycle.
 For adult patients, if both the nadir and day of dosing (Day 29, Day 1 of next cycle) ANC are greater than or equal to 1.5 x 109 / L (1500 / μL) and both the nadir and Day 29, Day 1 of next cycle platelet counts are greater than or equal to 100 x 109 / L (100,000 / μL), the TEMODAR dose may be increased to 200 mg / m² / day for 5 consecutive days per 28 - day treatment cycle.
 During treatment, a complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until the ANC is above 1.5 x 109 / L (1500 / μL) and the platelet count exceeds 100 x 109 / L (100,000 / μL).
 If the ANC falls to less than 1.0 x 109 / L (1000 / μL) or the platelet count is less than 50 x 109 / L (50,000 / μL) during any cycle, the next cycle should be reduced by 50 mg / m², but not below 100 mg / m², the lowest recommended dose (see Table 4).
 When reconstituted with 41 mL Sterile Water for Injection, the resulting solution will contain 2.5 mg / mL temozolomide.
 Using aseptic technique, withdraw up to 40 mL from each vial to make up the total dose based on Table 5 above and transfer into an empty 250 mL infusion bag {2}.
 The recommended initial dose of Tenex (guanfacine hydrochloride) when given alone or in combination with another antihypertensive drug is 1 mg daily given at bedtime to minimize somnolence.
 If after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy 1 mg does not give a satisfactory result, a dose of 2 mg may be given, although most of the effect of Tenex is seen at 1 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
 Higher daily doses have been used, but adverse reactions increase significantly with doses above 3 mg / day.
 In persons who have not been immunized previously against tetanus and diphtheria, primary immunization with TENIVAC vaccine consists of three 0.5 mL doses.
 TENIVAC vaccine may be used to complete the primary immunization series for tetanus and diphtheria, following one or two doses of Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (whole - cell DTP), Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (DTaP), and / or Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids Adsorbed (DT).
 Table 1: Guide for use of Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed (Td) for Tetanus Prophylaxis in Routine Wound Management in Persons 7 Years of Age and Older
 Each 0.5 mL dose of TENIVAC vaccine is to be administered intramuscularly.
 Chlorthalidone is usually given at a dose of 25 mg daily; the usual initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg daily.
 Therefore, the initial dose should be one TENORETIC (atenolol and chlorthalidone) 50 tablet given once a day.
 If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to one TENORETIC (atenolol and chlorthalidone) 100 tablet given once a day.
 When necessary, another antihypertensive agent may be added gradually beginning with 50 percent of the usual recommended starting dose to avoid an excessive fall in blood pressure.
 Creatinine Clearance Atenolol Elimination (mL / min / 1.73m2) Half - life (hrs) Maximum Dosage15 - 35 16 - 27 50 mg daily < 15 > 27 50 mg every other day
 Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg TENORMIN over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later.
 In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), TENORMIN Tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later.
 Thereafter, TENORMIN can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6 - 9 days or until discharge from the hospital.
 Data from other beta blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of IV beta blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication, the IV beta blocker may be eliminated and patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given TENORMIN Tablets 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once a day for at least seven days (if the IV dosing is excluded).
 Although the demonstration of efficacy of TENORMIN is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days, data from other beta blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta blockers that are effective in the postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications.
 Patients on hemodialysis should be given 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur.
 One immediate - release 25 mg tablet three times daily, one hour before meals, and in midevening if desired to overcome night hunger.
 TENUATE DOSPAN (diethylpropion hydrochloride) controlled - release: One controlled - release 75 mg tablet daily, swallowed whole, in midmorning.
 The recommended dose of TEPADINA in pediatric patients is two administrations of 5 mg / kg given intravenously approximately 12 hours apart on Day - 6 before allogeneic HSCT in conjunction with high - dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide as outlined in Table 1.
 Prior to and following each infusion, flush the catheter with approximately 5 ml sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection.
 The recommended dose of TEPADINA for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary is 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg intravenously.
 The recommended dose of TEPADINA for treatment of malignant effusions is 0.6 to 0.8 mg / kg intracavitary.
 The recommended dose of TEPADINA for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder is 60 mg in 30 to 60 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection into the bladder by catheter.
 If the patient finds it impossible to retain 60 mL for 2 hours, the dose may be given in a volume of 30 mL.
 Reconstitute TEPADINA 15 mg with 1.5 ml of sterile water for injection.
 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 1.5 ml of sterile water for injection.
 Reconstitute TEPADINA 100 mg with 10 ml of sterile water for injection.
 Using a syringe fitted with a needle, aseptically withdraw 10 ml of sterile water for injection.
 If not used immediately after reconstitution, the product is stable for 8 hours when stored at 2°C to 8°C (36° to 46°F).
 Prior to administration, dilute the reconstituted solution further with an appropriate volume of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection to obtain a final TEPADINA concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg / mL.
 After dilution the product is stable for 24 hours when stored at 2°C to 8°C (36° to 46°F) and for 4 hours when stored at 25°C (77°F).

 The usual subcutaneous dose of terbutaline sulfate injection is 0.25 mg injected into the lateral deltoid area.
 If significant clinical improvement does not occur within 15 to 30 minutes, a second dose of 0.25 mg may be administered.
 The total dose within 4 hours should not exceed 0.5 mg.
 Adults:  The usual daily dose is 250 mg administered once every 24 hours or 300 mg given in divided doses at 8 to 12 hour intervals.
 For children above eight years of age:  15 - 25 mg / kg of body weight up to a maximum of 250 mg per single daily injection.
 The recommended oral dose is 250 mg qid.
 The medicinal product is for single intravenous use only as repeated dosing has not been studied.
 The clinical use of TESLASCAN (mangafodipir) has been investigated at field strengths from 0.5 to 2.0 Tesla.
 The recommended dose is 0.5 ml / kg bodyweight (5 μmol / kg bodyweight).
 This corresponds to a dose of 35 ml for a 70 kg person.
 Above 100 kg body weight, 50 ml is usually sufficient to provide a diagnostically adequate contrast effect.
 Dosage for elderly 4
 Adults and Children over 10 years of age: Usual dose is one 100 mg capsule three times a day as needed for cough.
 If necessary to control cough, up to 600 mg daily in three divided doses may be given.
 The recommended starting dose of Testim® is 50 mg of testosterone (one tube) applied once daily (preferably in the morning) to clean, dry intact skin of the shoulders and / or upper arms.
 If the serum testosterone concentration is below the normal range (300 ng / dL to 1,000 ng / dL), the daily Testim dose may be increased from 50 mg testosterone (one tube) to 100 mg testosterone (two tubes) once daily.
 The maximum recommended dose of Testim is 100 mg once daily.
 If the serum testosterone concentrations are low, the dosing regimen may be increased to 2 systems.
 One TESTODERM (testosterone (transdermal)) or TESTODERM (testosterone (transdermal)) WITH ADHESIVE system should be placed on clean, dry, scrotal skin.
 The dosage guideline for the testosterone pellets for replacement therapy in androgendeficient males is 150mg to 450mg subcutaneously every 3 to 6 months.
 The usual dosage is as follows: implant two 75mg pellets for each 25mg testosterone propionate required weekly.
 Thus when a patient requires injections of 75mg per week, it is usually necessary to implant 450mg (6 pellets).
 With injections of 50mg per week, implantation of 300mg (4 pellets) may suffice for approximately three months.
 Replacement therapy in androgen - deficient males is 10 to 50 mg of Methyltestosterone daily.
 The dosage of Methyltestosterone for androgen therapy in breast carcinoma in females is from 50 - 200 mg daily.

 After the initial immunization series is completed (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE section), a booster dose of 0.5 mL of Tetanus Toxoid (tetanus (tetanus toxoid) toxoid) should be given intramuscularly every 10 years to maintain adequate immunity.
 Persons who had military service since 1941 can be considered to have received at least one dose.
 Persons who have received at least two doses of tetanus toxoid (tetanus (tetanus toxoid) toxoid) rapidly develop antitoxin antibodies.2
 The currently recommended prophylactic dose of TIG (Human) for wounds of average severity is 250 units intramuscularly.
 A series of three doses of 0.5 mL each, of Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed vaccine should be given intramuscularly; the second dose of 0.5 mL is given 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose; and the third dose of 0.5 mL is given 6 to 12 months after the second dose.
 Children who remain incompletely immunized after their seventh birthday should be counted as having prior exposure to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (e.g., a child who previously received two doses of DTaP or DTP needs only one dose of Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed vaccine to complete the primary series for tetanus).
 To maintain adequate protection, a booster dose of 0.5 mL of Td (For Adult Use) vaccine or Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed vaccine every 10 years thereafter is recommended.
 Persons who had military service since 1941 can be considered to have received at least one dose.

 The usual recommended dose of TEVETEN® HCT is 600 mg / 12.5 mg once daily when used as combination therapy in patients who are not volume - depleted (see WARNINGS, Hypotension in Volume - and / or Salt - Depleted Patients).
 If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using TEVETEN® HCT 600 / 12.5 mg is inadequate, patients may be titrated to TEVETEN® HCT 600 / 25 mg once daily.
 If the patient under treatment with TEVETEN® HCT requires additional blood pressure control at trough, or to maintain a twice a day dosing schedule of monotherapy, 300 mg TEVETEN® may be added as evening dose.
 No initial dosing adjustment is generally necessary in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment with maximum dose not exceeding 600 mg daily.
 A single dose given in the morning with food is recommended; divided doses are unnecessary.
 Therapy in most patients should be initiated with a single daily dose of 15 mg.
 If the response is insufficient after a suitable trial, the dosage may be increased to 30 mg and then to a single daily dose of 45 - 50 mg.
 INITIATION: Adults, initially 30 to 60 mg daily or 60 mg on alternate days.
 Some patients may require 90 to 120 mg at these intervals or up to 120 mg daily.Dosages above this level, however, do not usually produce a greater response.
 The recommended adult dose of intravenous Thallous Chloride Tl - 201 for planar myocardial imaging is 37 to 74 MBq (1 to 2 mCi).
 The recommended intravenous doses for SPECT myocardial imaging are 74 to 111 MBq (2 to 3 mCi).
 The efficacy of a 1.0 mCi dose for SPECT imaging has not been well established.
 For resting Thallous Chloride Tl - 201 studies, imaging should begin 10 to 20 minutes after injection.
 Consider dose reduction, delay, or discontinuation in patients who develop National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions and / or based on clinical judgment.
 The dose of THALOMID is 200 mg administered orally once daily with water, preferably at bedtime and at least 1 hour after the evening meal.

 For an episode of cutaneous ENL, THALOMID dosing should be initiated at 100 to 300 mg / day, administered once daily with water, preferably at bedtime and at least 1 hour after the evening meal.
 In patients with a severe cutaneous ENL reaction, or in those who have previously required higher doses to control the reaction, THALOMID dosing may be initiated at higher doses up to 400 mg / day once daily at bedtime or in divided doses with water, at least 1 hour after meals.
 Patients may then be tapered off medication in 50 mg decrements every 2 to 4 weeks.
 Tapering off medication should be attempted every 3 to 6 months, in decrements of 50 mg every 2 to 4 weeks.
 Theo - 24 (theophylline anhydrous capsule) ®, like other extended - release theophylline products, is intended for patients with relatively continuous or recurring symptoms who have a need to maintain therapeutic serum levels of theophylline.
 Patients who metabolize theophylline at a normal or slow rate are reasonable candidates for once - daily dosing with Theo - 24 (theophylline anhydrous capsule) ®.
 Those patients who require increased daily doses are more likely to experience relatively wide peak - trough differences and may be candidates for twice - a - day dosing with Theo - 24 (theophylline anhydrous capsule) ®.
 To avoid this phenomenon when two doses per day are prescribed, it is recommended that the second dose be given 10 to 12 hours after the morning dose and before the evening meal.
 Patients who require a relatively high dose of theophylline (i.e., a dose equal to or greater than 900 mg or 13 mg / kg, whichever is less) should not take Theo - 24 (theophylline anhydrous capsule) ® less than 1 hour before a high - fat - content meal since this may result in a significant increase in peak serum level and in the extent of absorption of theophylline as compared to administration in the fasted state (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug / Food Interactions).
 For example, at a dose of 900 mg / day in adults < 60 years or 22 mg / kg / day in children 1 - 9 years, the steady - state peak serum theophylline concentration will be < 10 mcg / mL in about 30% of patients, 10 - 20 mcg / mL in about 50% and 20 - 30 mcg / mL in about 20% of patients.
 In children 12 - 15 years of age, the final theophylline dose should not exceed 16 mg / kg / day up to a maximum of 400 mg / day in the presence of risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.
 In adolescents ≥ 16 years and adults, including the elderly, the final theophylline dose should not exceed 400 mg / day in the presence of risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.
 For example, at a dose of 900 mg / d in adults < 60 years or 22 mg / kg / d in children 1 - 9 years, the steady - state peak serum theophylline concentration will be < 10 mcg / mL in about 30%of patients, 10 - 20 mcg / mL in about 50%and 20 - 30 mcg / mL in about 20%of patients.
 If a mean volume of distribution of about 0.5 L / kg is assumed (actual range is 0.3 to 0.7 L / kg), each mg / kg (ideal body weight) of theophylline administered as a loading dose over 30 minutes results in an average 2 mcg / mL increase in serum theophylline concentration.
 Therefore, in a patient who has received no theophylline in the previous 24 hours, a loading dose of intravenous theophylline of 4.6 mg / kg, calculated on the basis of ideal body weight and administered over 30 minutes, on average, will produce maximum post - distribution serum concentration of 10 mcg / mL with a range of 6 - 16 mcg / mL.
 The mean volume of distribution can be assumed to be 0.5 L / kg and the desired serum concentration should be conservative (e.g., 10 mcg / mL) to allow for the variability in the volume of distribution.
 Once a serum concentration of 10 to 15 mcg / mL has been achieved with the use of a loading dose(s), a constant intravenous infusion is started.
 The rate of administration is based upon mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the population and calculated to achieve a target serum concentration of 10 mcg / mL (see Table V).
 For example, in non - smoking adults, initiation of a constant intravenous theophylline infusion of 0.4 mg / kg / hr at the completion of the loading dose, on average, will result in a steady - state concentration of 10 mcg / mL with a range of 7 - 26 mcg / mL.
 The mean and range of steady - state serum concentrations are similar when the average child (age 1 to 9 years) is given a loading dose of 4.6 mg / kg theophylline followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 0.8 mg / kg / hr.
 In contrast, if the second sample demonstrates a higher level, accumulation of the drug can be assumed, and the infusion rate should be decreased before the concentration exceeds 20 mcg / mL.
 In patients with cor pulmonale, cardiac decompensation, or liver dysfunction, or in those aking drugs that markedly reduce theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine), the initial theophylline infusion rate should not exceed 17 mg / hr unless serum concentrations can be monitored at 24 - hour intervals.
 If a mean volume of distribution of about 0.5 L / kg is assumed (actual range is 0.3 to 0.7 L / kg), each mg / kg (ideal body weight) of theophylline administered as a loading dose over 30 minutes results in an average 2 mcg / mL increase in serum theophylline concentration.
 Therefore, in a patient who has received no theophylline in the previous 24 hours, a loading dose of intravenous theophylline of 4.6 mg / kg, calculated on the basis of ideal body weight and administered over 30 minutes, on average, will produce a maximum post - distribution serum concentration of 10 mcg / mL with a range of 6 - 16 mcg / mL.
 The mean volume of distribution can be assumed to be 0.5 L / kg and the desired serum concentration should be conservative (e.g., 10 mcg / mL) to allow for the variability in the volume of distribution.

 The rate of administration is based upon mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the population and calculated to achieve a target serum concentration of 10 mcg / mL (see Table V).
 The mean and range of steady - state serum concentrations are similar when the average pediatric patient (age 1 to 9 years) is given a loading dose of 4.6 mg / kg theophylline followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 0.8 mg / kg / hr.
 In contrast, if the second sample demonstrates a higher level, accumulation of the drug can be assumed, and the infusion rate should be decreased before the concentration exceeds 20 mcg / mL.
 In patients with cor pulmonale, cardiac decompensation, or liver dysfunction, or in those taking drugs that markedly reduce theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine), the initial theophylline infusion rate should not exceed 17 mg / hr unless serum concentrations can be monitored at 24 - hour intervals.
 If a mean volume of distribution of about 0.5 L / kg is assumed (actual range is 0.3 to 0.7 L / kg), each mg / kg (ideal body weight) of theophylline administered as a loading dose over 30 minutes results in an average 2 mcg / mL increase in serum theophylline concentration.

 glassfuls) should be provided, including two glasses with each meal and at bedtime.
 The patients should be expected to awake at night to urinate; they should drink two more glasses of fluids before returning to bed.
 A minimum urine output of 2 liters / day on a consistent basis should be sought.
 The dose of THIOLA® should not be arbitrary but should be based on that amount required to reduce urinary cystine concentration to below its solubility limit (generally < 250 mg / liter).
 THIOLA® may be begun at a dosage of 800 mg / day in adult patients with cystine stones.
 In a multiclinic trial, average dose of THIOLA® was about 1000 mg / day.
 In children, initial dosage may be based on 15 mg / kg / day.
 Whenever possible, THIOLA® should be given in divided doses 3 times / day at least one hour before or 2 hours after meals.
 The usual starting dose for adult schizophrenic patients is 50 to 100 mg three times a day, with a gradual increment to a maximum of 800 mg daily if necessary.
 The total daily dosage ranges from 200 to 800 mg, divided into two to four doses.
 For pediatric patients with schizophrenia who are unresponsive to other agents, the recommended initial dose is 0.5 mg / kg / day given in divided doses.
 After maximum benefit is obtained by initial therapy, it is necessary to continue the patient on maintenance therapy (1 to 4 week intervals).

 The recommended dosage of Thymoglobulin for treatment of acute renal graft rejection is 1.5 mg / kg of body weight administered daily for 7 to 14 days.
 Thymoglobulin is supplied as a 10 mL vial containing lyophilized (solid) Thymoglobulin (25 mg).
 The Thymoglobulin dose should be reduced by one - half if the WBC count is between 2,000 and 3,000 cells / mm³ or if the platelet count is between 50,000 and 75,000 cells / mm³.
 Stopping Thymoglobulin treatment should be considered if the WBC count falls below 2,000 cells / mm³ or platelets below 50,000 cells / mm³.
 After calculating the number of vials needed, using aseptic technique, reconstitute each vial of Thymoglobulin with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP (SWFI).
 Adults: 500 µg.
 Doses between 200 and 500 µg have been used.
 500 µg is considered the optimum dose to give the maximum response in the greatest number of patients.
 Children age 6 to 16 years; 7 µg / kg body weight up to dose of 500 µg.
 Infants and children up to 6 years: Experience is limited in this age group; doses of 7 µg / kg have been administered.
 One blood sample for TSH assay should be drawn immediately prior to the injection of Thyrel® TRH, and a second sample should be obtained 30 minutes after injection.
 Normal: Baseline TSH levels of less than 10 microunits / mL (µU / mL) were observed in 97% of euthyroid normal subjects tested.
 Primary (thyroidal) hypothyroidism: The diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism is frequently supported by finding clearly elevated baseline TSH levels; 93% of patients tested had levels above 10 µU / mL, Thyrel TRH (protirelin) administration to these patients generally would not be expected to yield additional useful information.
 The recommended dosage of THYROGEN is a 0.9 mg intramuscular injection to the buttock followed by a second 0.9 mg intramuscular injection to the buttock 24 hours later.
 The usual starting dose is one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) ½ with increments of one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) !4 every 2 to 3 weeks.
 A lower starting dosage, one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) % / day, is recommended in patients with long - standing myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended.
 Most patients require one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) 1 to one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) 2 per day.
 Failure to respond to doses of one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) 3 suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption.
 Maintenance dosages of one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) 1 to one tablet of Thyrolar (liotrix) 2 per day usually result in normal serum levothyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels.
 Sodium levothyroxine (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg / mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly.
 This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV.
 Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.
 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone.
 For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mcg / kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days.
 When used as monotherapy, usual starting doses are 120 to 240 mg once daily.
 The usual dosage range studied in clinical trials was 120 to 540 mg once daily.
 Current clinical experience with 540 mg dose is limited; however, the dose may be increased to 540 mg once daily.
 Dosages for the treatment of angina should be adjusted to each patient's needs, starting with a dose of 120 mg to 180 mg once daily.
 Individual patients may respond to higher doses of up to 540 mg once daily.
 The dose for the intravesical treatment of carcinoma in situ and for the prophylaxis of recurrent papillary tumors consists of one vial of TICE® BCG suspended in 50 ml preservative - free saline.
 Draw 1 ml of sterile, preservative - free saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection U.S.P.)
 at 4 – 25°C, into a small syringe (e.g., 3 ml) and add to one vial of TICE® BCG to resuspend.
 Dispense the cloudy TICE® BCG suspension into the top end of a catheter - tip syringe which contains 49 ml of saline diluent, bringing the total volume to 50 ml.

 Store between 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).
 The recommended dosage regimen for tigecycline for injection is an initial dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg every 12 hours.
 The recommended duration of treatment with tigecycline for injection for complicated skin and skin structure infections or for complicated intra - abdominal infections is 5 to 14 days.
 The recommended duration of treatment with tigecycline for injection for community - acquired bacterial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days.
 In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), the initial dose of tigecycline for injection should be 100 mg followed by a reduced maintenance dose of 25 mg every 12 hours.
 Each vial of tigecycline for injection should be reconstituted with 5.3 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP to achieve a concentration of 10 mg / mL of tigecycline.
 Thus, 5 mL of reconstituted solution is equivalent to 50 mg of the drug.)
 Withdraw 5 mL of the reconstituted solution from the vial and add to a 100 mL intravenous bag for infusion (for a 100 mg dose, reconstitute two vials; for a 50 mg dose, reconstitute one vial).
 The maximum concentration in the intravenous bag should be 1 mg / mL.
 Alternatively, tigecycline for injection mixed with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP may be stored refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for up to 48 hours following immediate transfer of the reconstituted solution into the intravenous bag.
 If the QTc is greater than 440 msec (500 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), TIKOSYN is contraindicated.
 Patients with heart rates <50 beats per minute have not been studied.
 When serum creatinine is given in μmol / L, divide the value by 88.4 (1 mg / dL = 88.4 μmol / L).
 If the QTc has increased by greater than 15% compared to the baseline established in Step 1 OR if the QTc is greater than 500 msec (550 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), subsequent dosing should be adjusted as follows:
 NOTE: If at any time after the second dose of TIKOSYN is given the QTc is greater than 500 msec (550 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), TIKOSYN should be discontinued.
 If QTc exceeds 500 milliseconds (550 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), TIKOSYN therapy should be discontinued and patients should be carefully monitored until QTc returns to baseline levels.
 In clinical trials (see Clinical Studies), the highest dose of 500 mcg BID of TIKOSYN as modified by the dosing algorithm led to greater effectiveness than lower doses of 125 or 250 mcg BID as modified by the dosing algorithm.
 The maximum recommended dose in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL / min is 500 mcg BID; doses greater than 500 mcg BID have been associated with an increased incidence of Torsade de Pointes.
 Because of the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of amiodarone, TIKOSYN should not be initiated following amiodarone therapy until amiodarone plasma levels are below 0.3 mcg / mL or until amiodarone has been withdrawn for at least three months.
 The recommended dosage for adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is two inhalations four times a day at regular intervals, which provides a dose of 14 mg per day.

 Administer TIROSINT as a single daily dose, preferably one - half to one hour before breakfast.
 The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg per kg per day (e.g., 100 - 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).
 For elderly patients or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, a starting dose of levothyroxine sodium as low as 12.5 mcg per day may be appropriate, with gradual increments in dose at 6 - 8 week intervals, as needed [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 In general, levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required.
 In children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, a lower initial dose of 25 mcg per day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increasing increments of 25 mcg every 2 - 4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.
 Administer TIROSINT - SOL as a single daily oral dose, on an empty stomach, one - half to one hour before breakfast.

 Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required.
 For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day.
 In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day.
 Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.
 Start at a lower dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and children at risk for hyperactivity (see below).
 Newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure: Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure.
 For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester specific range, increase the dose of TIROSINT - SOL by 12.5 to 25 mcg per day and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable TIROSINT - SOL dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range.
 In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start TIROSINT - SOL at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day).
 In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH < 10 mIU per Liter), start TIROSINT - SOL at 1.0 mcg per kg body weight per day.
 For treatment of mild to moderate acute pain, the dosage is 20 mg three times daily or 40 mg two or three times daily.
 The recommended total dose should not exceed 50 mg and is based upon patient weight.
 THE 10 mL SYRINGE WITH TWINPAK™ DUAL CANNULA DEVICE
 The recommended dosage for both adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is 1 single - use ampule (300 mg) administered BID for 28 days.
 All patients should be administered 300 mg BID.
 The recommended dosage of TOBI Podhaler for both adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is the inhalation of the contents of four 28 mg TOBI Podhaler capsules twice - daily for 28 days using the Podhaler device.
 Each dose of four capsules should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible; each dose should not be taken less than 6 hours apart.
 One or two drops instilled into the conjunctival sac(s) every four to six hours.
 During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the dosage may be increased to one or two drops every two (2) hours.
 Apply a small amount (approximately 1 / 2 inch ribbon) into the conjunctival sac(s) up to three or four times daily.
 Instill one drop into the conjunctival sac(s) every four to six hours.
 During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the dosage may be increased to one drop every two hours.
 It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS BOX and PRECAUTIONS).
 Administration for Patients With Normal Renal Function – Adults With Serious Infections: 3 mg / kg / day in 3 equal doses every 8 hours (see Table 1).
 Adults With Life - Threatening Infections: Up to 5 mg / kg / day may be administered in 3 or 4 equal doses (see Table 1).
 The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg / kg / day as soon as clinically indicated.
 To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed 5 mg / kg / day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS BOX and PRECAUTIONS).
 Pediatric patients: 6 to 7.5 mg / kg / day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses (2 to 2.5 mg / kg every 8 hours or 1.5 to 1.89 mg / kg every 6 hours).

 The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days.
 Table 1 - DOSAGE SCHEDULE GUIDE FOR ADULTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION (Dosage at 8 - Hour Intervals)
 In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosage regimen of 10 mg / kg / day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended.
 Following a loading dose of 1 mg / kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8 - hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals.
 Reduced dosage at 8 - hour intervals: When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 1 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram.
 Intravenous Administration – For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses.
 Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg / mL (see WARNINGS BOX).
 Using aseptic technique, the closure may be penetrated only 1 time after reconstitution using a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set, which allows measured dispensing of the contents.
 The contents of the vial should be diluted with 30 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to provide a solution containing 40 mg of tobramycin per mL.
 Initially, 100 mg / day in divided doses gradually increased to 200 mg / day as required.
 If no response after two weeks, increase to 250 to 300 mg / day.
 Initially, 75 mg / day increased to 150 mg / day.
 Dosages over 200 mg / day are not recommended.
 Maintenance, 50 to 150 mg / day.
 Initially, 30 to 40 mg / day; it is generally not necessary to exceed 100 mg / day.
 Initially, an oral dose of 25 mg / day should be tried in children aged 6 and older.
 If a satisfactory response does not occur within one week, increase the dose to 50 mg nightly in children under 12 years; children over 12 may receive up to 75 mg nightly.
 A daily dose greater than 75 mg does not enhance efficacy and tends to increase side effects.
 Evidence suggests that in early night bedwetters, the drug is more effective given earlier and in divided amounts, i.e., 25 mg in midafternoon, repeated at bedtime.
 A dose of 2.5 mg / kg / day should not be exceeded.
 Therapy should be initiated at 75 mg / day.
 Dosage may be increased to 150 mg / day which is the dose level at which optimum response is usually obtained.
 If necessary, dosage may be increased to 200 mg / day.
 Dosage higher than 75 mg / day may also be administered on a once - a - day basis after the optimum dosage and tolerance have been determined.
 Therapy should be initiated at 100 to 150 mg / day and may be increased to 200 mg / day.
 If there is no response after two weeks, dosage should be increased to 250 to 300 mg / day.
 Dosage higher than 150 mg / day may also be administered on a once - a - day basis after the optimum dosage and tolerance have been determined.
 The usual maintenance dosage is 75 to 150 mg / day.
 Therapy in these age groups should be initiated with Tofranil™, brand of imipramine hydrochloride tablets, at a total daily dosage of 25 to 50 mg, since Tofranil - PM capsules are not available in these strengths.
 Dosage may be increased according to response and tolerance, but it is generally unnecessary to exceed 100 mg / day in these patients.
 Tofranil - PM capsules may be used when total daily dosage is established at 75 mg or higher.
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with Tofranil - PM is unclear.
 For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, the recommended starting dose for adults is 400 mg three times daily (1200 mg daily), preferably including a dose on arising and a dose at bedtime.
 Control is usually achieved at doses of 600 - 1800 mg daily in divided doses (generally t.i.d.).
 Doses larger than 1800 mg / day have not been studied and are not recommended.
 For the relief of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (2 years and older) is 20 mg / kg / day in divided doses (t.i.d.
 When control has been achieved, the usual dose ranges from 15 to 30 mg / kg / day.
 Doses higher than 30 mg / kg / day have not been studied, and, therefore, are not recommended.
 The usual starting dose of TOLINASE (tolazamide) Tablets for the mild to moderately severe Type II diabetic patient is 100 - 250 mg daily administered with breakfast or the first main meal.
 Generally, if the fasting blood glucose is less than 200 mg / dl, the starting dose is 100 mg / day as a single daily dose.
 If the fasting blood glucose value is greater than 200 mg / dl, the starting dose is 250 mg / day as a single dose.
 If the patient is malnourished, underweight, elderly, or not eating properly, the initial therapy should be 100 mg once a day.
 Tolbutamide: If receiving less than 1 gm / day, begin at 100 mg of tolazamide per day.
 If receiving 1 gm or more per day, initiate at 250 mg of tolaza - mide per day as a single dose.
 Chlorpropamide: 250 mg of chlorpropamide may be considered to provide approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 mg of tolazamide.
 The patient should be observed carefully for hypoglycemia during the transition period from chlorpropamide to TOLINASE (tolazamide) (one to two weeks) due to the prolonged retention of chlor - propamide in the body and the possibility of a subsequent overlapping drug effect.
 Acetohexamide: 100 mg of tolazamide may be considered to provide approximately the same degree of blood glucose control as 250 mg of ace - tohexamide.
 If the patientγ¢††s previous insulin dosage has been less than 20 units, substitution of 100 mg of tolazamide per day as a single daily dose may be tried.
 If the previous insulin dosage was less than 40 units, but more than 20 units, the patient should be placed directly on 250 mg of tolazamide per day as a single dose.
 If the previous insulin dosage was greater than 40 units, the insulin dosage should be decreased by 50% and 250 mg of tolazamide per day started.
 The dosage of TOLINASE (tolazamide) should be adjusted weekly (or more often in the group previously requiring more than 40 units of insulin).
 Daily doses of greater than 1000 mg are not recommended.
 The usual maintenance dose is in the range of 100 - 1000 mg / day with the average maintenance dose being 250 - 500 mg / day.
 Following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustment is made in increments of 100 mg to 250 mg at weekly intervals based on the patientγ¢††s blood glucose response.
 Doses up to 500 mg / day should be given as a single dose in the morning.
 500 mg once daily is as effective as 250 mg twice daily.
 When a dose of more than 500 mg / day is required, the dose may be divided and given twice daily.
 The recommended initial dosage is 400 mg every 8 hours.
 The usual adult dosage is between 1200 and 1800 mg / day in a three dose daily divided regimen.
 Doses beyond 2400 mg per day have been administered infrequently.
 Some patients, particularly those with renal or hepatic impairment, may be adequately treated with less than 1200 mg / day.
 The recommended dose for TOPAMAX® monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg / day in two divided doses.
 Approximately 58% of patients randomized to 400 mg / day achieved this maximal dose in the monotherapy controlled trial; the mean dose achieved in the trial was 275 mg / day.
 Children Ages 2 to < 10 Years
 During the titration period, the initial dose of TOPAMAX® should be 25 mg / day administered nightly for the first week.
 Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg / day (25 mg twice daily) in the second week.
 Table 2: Monotherapy Target Total Daily Maintenance Dosing for Patients 2 to < 10 Years
 The recommended total daily dose of TOPAMAX® as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures is 200 to 400 mg / day in two divided doses, and 400 mg / day in two divided doses as adjunctive treatment in adults with primary generalized tonic - clonic seizures.
 It is recommended that therapy be initiated at 25 to 50 mg / day followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 to 50 mg / day every week.
 Titrating in increments of 25 mg / day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose.
 Doses above 400 mg / day (600, 800 or 1,000 mg / day) have not been shown to improve responses in dose - response studies in adults with partial onset seizures.
 Daily doses above 1,600 mg have not been studied.
 Pediatric Patients Ages 2 - 16 Years – Partial Onset Seizures, Primary Generalized Tonic - Clonic Seizures, or Lennox - Gastaut Syndrome
 The recommended total daily dose of TOPAMAX® as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients with partial onset seizures, primary generalized tonic - clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox - Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 to 9 mg / kg / day in two divided doses.
 Titration should begin at 25 mg / day (or less, based on a range of 1 to 3 mg / kg / day) nightly for the first week.
 The dosage should then be increased at 1 - or 2 - week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg / kg / day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response.
 In the study of primary generalized tonic - clonic seizures, the initial titration rate was slower than in previous studies; the assigned dose of 6 mg / kg / day was reached at the end of 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies].
 The recommended total daily dose of TOPAMAX® as treatment for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older for prophylaxis of migraine headache is 100 mg / day administered in two divided doses (Table 3).

 The recommended dose of TORISEL for advanced renal cell carcinoma is 25 mg infused over a 30 – 60 minute period once a week.
 Patients should receive prophylactic intravenous diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg (or similar antihistamine) approximately 30 minutes before the start of each dose of TORISEL [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 TORISEL should be held for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1,000 / mm3, platelet count <75,000 / mm3, or NCI CTCAE grade 3 or greater adverse reactions.
 Once toxicities have resolved to grade 2 or less, TORISEL may be restarted with the dose reduced by 5 mg / week to a dose no lower than 15 mg / week.
 If patients must be co - administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, based on pharmacokinetic studies, a TORISEL dose increase from 25 mg / week up to 50 mg / week should be considered.
 TORISEL 25 mg / mL injection must be diluted with the supplied diluent before further dilution in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 The individual dosage is based on calculation of the Body Surface Area (BSA) up to a maximum dose of 2000 mg (each on Day 1 and 2) and 1000 mg (Day 3), corresponding to a BSA of 2 m².
 The Totect® dose should be reduced by 50% in patients with creatinine clearance values < 40 mL / min.
 Each vial of Totect® (dexrazoxane for injection) (500 mg) must first be mixed with 50 mL of the enclosed diluent.
 The resultant solution contains 10 mg / mL.
 Withdraw the recommended dose from the solution containing 10 mg / mL as prepared in Step 1 and further dilute into an infusion bag containing 1000 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride.
 The recommended starting dose of Toviaz is 4 mg once daily.

 The daily dose of Toviaz should not exceed 4 mg in the following populations:
 ToxiBan Granules - To make a thin suspension mix one volume measure with 5 to 7 parts of cold water (Ex: one level cup ToxiBan Granules to 6 cupfuls water) and shake or stir vigorously for 10 - 30 seconds until good suspension is obtained.
 Large Animals - The recommended dosage is 0.75 to 2.0 grams per kilogram (0.35 to 0.9 grams per pound) body weight.
 One pound (453.6 grams) will normally treat an animal weighing 225 to 600 kilograms (500 to 1300 pounds).
 Small Animals - 2 to 4 grams per kg (1 to 2 grams per pound) body weight.
 Small Animals - 10 to 20 mL per kg (5 to 10 mL per pound) body weight.
 Large Animals - 4 to 12 mL per kg (2 to 6 mL per pound) body weight.
 2 grams ToxiBan Granules is equivalent to the charcoal activity of 9 mL ToxiBan Suspension.
 The position of the tube can be checked by injecting one mL of sterile saline.
 For a detailed description of oral administration of liquids refer to pages 536 - 540 of the 5th edition of Handbook o f Veterinary Procedures & Emergency Treatment by Kirk et al.
 Initiate treatment at 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then increase to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily.
 Doses above 125 mg twice daily did not appear to confer additional benefit sufficient to offset the increased risk of hepatotoxicity.
 Discontinue Tracleer if liver aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity (such as nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN.
 Table 1: Dosage Adjustment and Monitoring in Patients Developing Aminotransferase Elevations > 3 x ULN
 In patients with a body weight below 40 kg but who are over 12 years of age, the recommended initial and maintenance dose is 62.5 mg twice daily.
 In patients who have been receiving ritonavir for at least 10 days, start Tracleer at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 After at least 10 days following the initiation of ritonavir, resume Tracleer at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 Initiation of Tracleer should generally be avoided in patients with elevated aminotransferases > 3 x ULN.
 Nevertheless, to avoid the potential for clinical deterioration, gradual dose reduction (62.5 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days) should be considered.
 Adults: A dose of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) of 0.4 to 0.5 mg / kg (1.7 to 2.2 times the ED95), given as an intravenous bolus injection, is the recommended initial dose for most patients.
 With this dose, good or excellent conditions for nonemergency intubation can be expected in 2 to 2.5 minutes in most patients, with maximum neuromuscular block achieved approximately 3 to 5 minutes after injection.
 Clinically required neuromuscular block generally lasts 20 to 35 minutes under balanced anesthesia.
 The same initial dose of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) of 0.4 to 0.5 mg / kg may be used for intubation prior to administration of these inhalation agents; however, if TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) is first administered under steady state of isoflurane or enflurane, the initial dose of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) should be reduced by approximately one third, i.e., to 0.25 to 0.35 mg / kg, to adjust for the potentiating effects of these anesthetic agents.
 Doses of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) of 0.08 to 0.10 mg / kg are recommended for maintenance of neuromuscular block during prolonged surgical procedures.
 Because TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) lacks cumulative effects, maintenance doses may be administered at relatively regular intervals for each patient, ranging approximately from 15 to 25 minutes under balanced anesthesia, slightly longer under isoflurane or enflurane.
 Higher doses of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) (up to 0.2 mg / kg) permit maintenance dosing at longer intervals.
 A dose of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) of 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg is recommended as the initial dose for infants (1 month to 2 years of age) under halothane anesthesia.
 Special Considerations: An initial dose of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) of 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg, given slowly or in divided doses over 1 minute, is recommended for adults, adolescents, children, or infants with significant cardiovascular disease and for adults, adolescents, children, or infants with any history (e.g., severe anaphylactoid reactions or asthma) suggesting a greater risk of histamine release.
 An initial dose of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) of 0.3 to 0.4 mg / kg is recommended for adults following the use of succinylcholine for intubation under balanced anesthesia.
 Infusion in the Operating Room (OR): After administration of a recommended initial bolus dose of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) (0.3 to 0.5 mg / kg), a diluted solution of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) can be administered by continuous infusion to adults and pediatric patients aged 2 or more years for maintenance of neuromuscular block during extended surgical procedures.
 An initial infusion rate of 9 to 10 mcg / kg per minute may be required to rapidly counteract the spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function.
 Thereafter, a rate of 5 to 9 mcg / kg per minute should be adequate to maintain continuous neuromuscular block in the range of 89% to 99% in most pediatric and adult patients under balanced anesthesia.
 Occasional patients may require infusion rates as low as 2 mcg / kg per minute or as high as 15 mcg / kg per minute.
 In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with induced hypothermia, the rate of infusion of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) required to maintain adequate surgical relaxation during hypothermia (25° to 28° C) has been shown to be approximately half the rate required during normothermia.
 Spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block following discontinuation of infusion of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) may be expected to proceed at a rate comparable to that following administration of a single bolus dose.
 An infusion rate of 11 to 13 mcg / kg per minute (range: 4.5 to 29.5) should provide adequate neuromuscular block in adult patients in an ICU.
 The following tables provide guidelines for delivery, in mL / hr (equivalent to microdrops / min when 60 microdrops = 1 mL), of solutions of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) in concentrations of 0.2 mg / mL (20 mg in 100 mL) or 0.5 mg / mL (50 mg in 100 mL) with an infusion pump or a gravity flow device.

 Infusion solutions of TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) may be prepared by admixing TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) Injection with an appropriate diluent such as 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 Solutions containing 0.2 mg / mL or 0.5 mg / mL TRACRIUM (atracurium besylate) in the above diluents may be stored either under refrigeration or at room temperature for 24 hours without significant loss of potency.
 The recommended dose of TRADJENTA is 5 mg once daily.
 The recommended initial dosage is 100 mg twice daily whether used alone or added to a diuretic regimen.
 After 2 or 3 days, using standing blood pressure as an indicator, dosage may be titrated in increments of 100 mg b.i.d.
 The usual maintenance dosage of labetalol HCl is between 200 and 400 mg twice daily.
 Patients with severe hypertension may require from 1,200 to 2,400 mg per day, with or without thiazide diuretics.
 Titration increments should not exceed 200 mg twice daily.
 As in the general patient population, labetalol therapy may be initiated at 100 mg twice daily and titrated upwards in increments of 100 mg b.i.d.
 The majority of elderly patients will require between 100 and 200 mg b.i.d.
 The suggested starting dose is between 0.2 mg / hr*, and 0.4 mg / hr*.
 Doses between 0.4 mg / hr* and 0.8 mg / hr* have shown continued effectiveness for 10 - 12 hours daily for at least one month (the longest period studied) of intermittent administration.
 Only one patch should be worn at any time.
 The usual daily dose is 30 mg.
 The dose should be adjusted gradually within the range of 15 to 60 mg daily in accordance with the response of the patient.
 In elderly or debilitated patients it is advisable to initiate treatment at a daily dose of 7.5 to 15 mg.
 TRANXENE tablets may also be administered in a single dose daily at bedtime; the recommended initial dose is 15 mg. After the initial dose, the response of the patient may require adjustment of subsequent dosage.
 Thereafter, gradually reduce the daily dose to 7.5 to 15 mg.
 The maximum recommended total daily dose is 90 mg. Avoid excessive reductions in the total amount of drug administered on successive days.
 The maximum recommended initial dose in patients over 12 years old is 7.5 mg three times a day.
 Dosage should be increased by no more than 7.5 mg every week and should not exceed 90 mg / day.
 The maximum recommended initial dose is 7.5 mg two times a day.
 Dosage should be increased by no more than 7.5 mg every week and should not exceed 60 mg / day.
 Trasylol® (aprotinin) is supplied as a solution containing 10,000 KIU / mL, which is equal to 1.4 mg / mL.
 Both regimens include a 1 mL initial (test) dose, a loading dose, a dose to be added while recirculating the priming fluid of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit ("pump prime" dose), and a constant infusion dose.
 Regimens A and B, both incorporating a 1 mL initial (test) dose, are described in the table below:
 The 1 mL initial (test) dose should be administered intravenously at least 10 minutes before the loading dose.
 If a patient is unable to take enteral nourishment for a prolonged period of time, institution of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with exogenous calories should be considered.
 Recommended Dietary Allowances* of protein range from approximately 0.75 g / kg of body weight for adults to 1.68 g / kg for infants.
 Daily amino acid doses of approximately 1.0 to 1.5 g / kg of body weight for adults with adequate calories are generally sufficient to satisfy protein needs and promote positive nitrogen balance.
 For protein - sparing in well - nourished patients not receiving significant additional calories, amino acid dosages of 1.0 to 1.7 g / kg / day reduce nitrogen losses and spare body protein.
 If daily increases in BUN in the range of 10 to 15 mg% for more than three days should occur, then protein - sparing therapy should be discontinued and a regimen with full nonprotein calorie substrates should be adopted.
 Quantities of 60 to 180 mEq of potassium per day have been used with adequate clinical effect.
 Two to three g / kg of body weight for infants with adequate calories are generally sufficient to satisfy protein needs and promote positive nitrogen balance.
 Solutions administered by peripheral vein should not exceed twice normal serum osmolarity (718 mOsmol / L).
 In pediatric patients, the final solution should not exceed twice normal serum osmolarity (718 mOsmol / L).
 Intravenous fat emulsions provide approximately 1.1 kcal / mL (10%) or 2.0 kcal / mL (20%) and may be administered along with amino acid - dextrose solutions by means of a short Y - connector near the infusion site to supplement caloric intake.
 When used postoperatively, the therapy should begin with 1000 mL on the first postoperative day.
 Thereafter, the dose may be increased to 3000 mL per day.
 The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
 If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.
 The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
 If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.
 The concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride in the solution is 90 mg / mL and the concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride in the reconstituted solution of lyophilized powder is 5 mg / mL.
 The recommended dose is 100 mg / m² administered intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 28 - day cycle, up to 6 cycles.
 Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity: for Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 50 mg / m² on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 3 or greater toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 25 mg / m² on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle.
 Dose modifications for non - hematologic toxicity: for clinically significant Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 50 mg / m² on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle.
 The recommended dose is 120 mg / m² administered intravenously over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of a 21 - day cycle, up to 8 cycles.
 Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity: for Grade 4 toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg / m² on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 4 toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg / m² on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle.
 Dose modifications for non - hematologic toxicity: for Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg / m² on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 3 or greater toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg / m² on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle.
 Once diluted with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose / 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours when stored under refrigerated conditions at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) or for 2 hours when stored at room temperature (15° to 30°C or 59° to 86°F) and room light.
 TREANDA for Injection (25 mg / vial or 100 mg / vial lyophilized powder) Once diluted with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose / 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours when stored under refrigerated conditions at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) or for 3 hours when stored at room temperature (15° to 30°C or 59° to 86°F) and room light.
 Ethionamide should be administered with at least one, sometimes two, other drugs to which the organism is known to be susceptible (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).
 The usual adult dose is 15 to 20 mg / kg / day, administered once daily or, if patient exhibits poor gastrointestinal tolerance, in divided doses, with a maximum daily dosage of 1 gram.
 Trecator tablets have been reformulated from a sugar - coated tablet to a film - coated tablet.
 Therapy should be initiated at a dose of 250 mg daily, with gradual titration to optimal doses as tolerated by the patient.
 A regimen of 250 mg daily for 1 or 2 days, followed by 250 mg twice daily for 1 or 2 days with a subsequent increase to 1 gm in 3 or 4 divided doses has been reported.4,5 Thus far, there is insufficient evidence to indicate the lowest effective dosage levels.
 In the adult this would seem to be between 0.5 and 1.0 gm daily, with an average of 0.75 gm daily.
 However, pediatric dosages of 10 to 20 mg / kg p.o.
 daily in 2 or 3 divided doses given after meals or 15 mg / kg / 24 hrs as a single daily dose have been recommended.1,2 As with adults, ethionamide may be administered to pediatric patients once daily.
 TRELSTAR is administered by a single intramuscular injection in either buttock.
 TRELSTAR is administered by a single intramuscular injection in either buttock.

 Immediately discard the syringe assembly after a single use into a suitable sharps container.
 TRELSTAR is administered by a single intramuscular injection in either buttock.
 Immediately discard the syringe assembly after a single use into a suitable sharps container.
 The recommended starting dosage of Trental (pentoxifylline) is 400 mg twice daily after meals.
 The usual dose is 400 mg twice or three times daily.
 A maximum of 400 mg three times daily should not be exceeded.
 Trental 400 mg sustained release tablets must be swallowed whole.
 As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes.
 The recommended starting dose of TRESIBA in insulin naïve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is 10 units once daily.
 A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in the FXIII congenitally deficient population evaluating five dose cohorts (2, 7, 24, 60 and 89 IU / kg) with blood sampling at 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours, and 7, 14, and 28 days.
 Draw back the plunger of the sterile syringe and admit a volume of 3.2 mL air into the syringe.
 Then hold the syringe with the diluent vial upside down and withdraw 3.2 mL water into the syringe.
 Push the plunger slowly to inject all water (3.2 mL) into the powder vial.
 Methotrexate is administered orally or intramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for a five - day course.
 One to two courses of methotrexate after normalization of hCG is usually recommended.
 When used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg / m² in combination with 60 mg / m² of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients treated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks.
 When remission is achieved and supportive care has produced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows: Methotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total weekly doses of 30 mg / m².
 It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg / kg intravenously every 14 days.
 Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg / day orally for 4 to 8 days.
 Treatment in all stages usually consists of several courses of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods.
 Lymphosarcomas in Stage III may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of 0.625 to 2.5 mg / kg daily.
 Therapy with methotrexate as a single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treated.
 Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly.
 Methotrexate has also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in patients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy.
 The recommended starting dose is 10 mg / m² given once weekly.
 Experience does suggest, however, that children receiving 20 to 30 mg / m² / wk (0.65 to 1.0 mg / kg / wk) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.
 The recommended dosage for adults is 1 tablet of TREXIMET 85 / 500 mg. TREXIMET 85 / 500 mg contains a dose of sumatriptan higher than the lowest effective dose.
 The choice of the dose of sumatriptan, and of the use of a fixed combination such as in TREXIMET 85 / 500 mg should be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose of sumatriptan with the potential for a greater risk of adverse reactions.
 The maximum recommended dosage in a 24 - hour period is 2 tablets, taken at least 2 hours apart.
 The recommended dosage for pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is 1 tablet of TREXIMET 10 / 60 mg.
 The maximum recommended dosage in a 24 - hour period is 1 tablet of TREXIMET 85 / 500 mg.
 In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the recommended dosage in a 24 - hour period is 1 tablet of TREXIMET 10 / 60 mg [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The usual adult dosage is two (2) TREZIX™ capsules orally every four (4) hours, as needed.
 No more than two (2) capsules should be taken in a 4 - hour period.
 No more than five (5) doses, or ten (10) capsules should be taken in a 24 - hour period.
 Table 1: Instructions for Administration of Tri - Sprintec
 There are two ways to start taking birth control pills, Sunday Start or Day 1 Start.
 Table 2: Instructions for Missed Tri - Sprintec Tablets
 If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking an active tablet, handle this as a missed tablet [see FDA - ApprovedPatient Labeling].
 The maximum recommended dose of Tribenzor is 40 / 10 / 25 mg.
 Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 160 mg once daily.
 The initial dose of TRICOR is 160 mg once daily.
 The initial dose is 54 to 160 mg per day.
 The maximum dose is 160 mg once daily.
 Treatment with TRICOR should be initiated at a dose of 54 mg per day in patients having mild to moderately impaired renal function, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose.
 Initially, give 0.9 gram daily; increase this dose by 300 mg at weekly intervals until therapeutic results are seen or until toxic symptoms appear.
 Usually 0.3 - 0.9 gram daily in 3 or 4 equally divided doses.
 The initial recommended dose of TRIESENCE® (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) suspension is 4 mg (100 microliters of 40 mg / mL suspension) with subsequent dosage as needed over the course of treatment.
 The recommended dose of TRIESENCE® (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) suspension is 1 to 4 mg (25 to 100 microliters of 40 mg / mL suspension) administered intravitreally
 Triferic 50 mL ampule can be added to each 25 gallons (94.6 L) of master bicarbonate mix at each center at a ratio of one (1) 50 mL ampule for each 25 gallons of bicarbonate concentrate.
 Each mL of Triferic contains 5.44 mg of iron as iron (III).
 The dose of Triglide is 160 mg once daily.
 Treatment with Trileptal should be initiated with a dose of 600 mg / day, given in a twice - a - day regimen.
 If clinically indicated, the dose may be increased by a maximum of 600 mg / day at approximately weekly intervals; the recommended daily dose is 1200 mg / day.
 Daily doses above 1200 mg / day show somewhat greater effectiveness in controlled trials, but most patients were not able to tolerate the 2400 mg / day dose, primarily because of CNS effects.
 It is recommended that the patient be observed closely and plasma levels of the concomitant AEDs be monitored during the period of Trileptal titration, as these plasma levels may be altered, especially at Trileptal doses greater than 1200 mg / day [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 Patients receiving concomitant AEDs may be converted to monotherapy by initiating treatment with Trileptal at 600 mg / day (given in a twice - a - day regimen) while simultaneously initiating the reduction of the dose of the concomitant AEDs.
 Trileptal may be increased as clinically indicated by a maximum increment of 600 mg / day at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended daily dose of 2400 mg / day.
 A daily dose of 1200 mg / day has been shown in one study to be effective in patients in whom monotherapy has been initiated with Trileptal.
 In these patients, Trileptal should be initiated at a dose of 600 mg / day (given in a twice - a - day regimen); the dose should be increased by 300 mg / day every third day to a dose of 1200 mg / day.
 Controlled trials in these patients examined the effectiveness of a 1200 mg / day dose; a dose of 2400 mg / day has been shown to be effective in patients converted from other AEDs to Trileptal monotherapy (see above).
 In pediatric patients aged 4 - 16 years, treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 8 - 10 mg / kg generally not to exceed 600 mg / day, given in a twice - a - day regimen.
 20 - 29 kg - 900 mg / day 29.1 - 39 kg - 1200 mg / day > 39 kg - 1800 mg / day
 In the clinical trial, in which the intention was to reach these target doses, the median daily dose was 31 mg / kg with a range of 6 - 51 mg / kg.
 In pediatric patients aged 2 - < 4 years, treatment should also be initiated at a daily dose of 8 - 10 mg / kg generally not to exceed 600 mg / day, given in a twice - a - day regimen.
 The maximum maintenance dose of Trileptal should be achieved over 2 - 4 weeks and should not exceed 60 mg / kg / day in a twice - a - day regimen.
 In the clinical trial in pediatric patients (2 to 4 years of age) in which the intention was to reach the target dose of 60 mg / kg / day, 50% of patients reached a final dose of at least 55 mg / kg / day.
 The concomitant antiepileptic drugs can be completely withdrawn over 3 - 6 weeks while Trileptal may be increased as clinically indicated by a maximum increment of 10 mg / kg / day at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended daily dose.
 The dose should be increased by 5 mg / kg / day every third day to the recommended daily dose shown in the table below.
 In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min) Trileptal therapy should be initiated at one - half the usual starting dose (300 mg / day) and increased slowly to achieve the desired clinical response [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]
 The initial dose of Trilipix is 45 to 135 mg once daily.
 The maximum dose is 135 mg once daily.
 The dose of Trilipix is 135 mg once daily.
 Treatment with Trilipix should be initiated at a dose of 45 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and should only be increased after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose.
 In rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, the more severe arthritides, and acute painful shoulder, the recommended starting dosage is 1500 mg given b.i.d.

 Oral Administration: Adults: At a rate of 240 mL (8 oz.)
 Pediatric Patients (aged 6 months or greater): At a rate of 25 mL / kg / hour, until the rectal effluent is clear or 4 liters are consumed.
 Pediatric Patients (aged 6 months or greater): At a rate of 25 mL / kg / hour, until the rectal effluent is clear or 4 liters are consumed.
 One method is to schedule patients for examination in midmorning or later, allowing the patients three hours for drinking and an additional one hour period for complete bowel evacuation.
 Note: If not using flavor packs, omit steps one and two above.
 The solution is more palatable if chilled before administration.
 The usual oral adult dosage is 100 mg of trimethoprim every 12 hours or 200 mg trimethoprim (trimethoprim (trimethoprim tablet) tablet) (two 100 mg tablets) every 24 hours, each for 10 days.
 The use of trimethoprim (trimethoprim (trimethoprim tablet) tablet) in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 15 mL / min is not recommended.
 For patients with a creatinine clearance of 15 to 30 mL / min, the dose should be 50 mg every 12 hours.
 Take one active tablet daily for 21 days followed by one dark green inactive tablet daily for 7 days.
 After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day (Sunday).
 If the patient misses one (1) active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a Â(2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a day until she finishes the pack.
 If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more active tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one tablet every day until Sunday.
 The dosage of TriNessa® for the initial cycle of therapy is one active tablet administered daily from the 1st day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as “Day 1” followed by one dark green inactive tablet daily for 7 days.
 After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day.
 If the patient misses one (1) active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers.
 If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a day until she finishes the pack.
 If the patient misses two (2) active tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more active tablets in a row, the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day.
 Take one active tablet daily for 21 days followed by one dark green inactive tablet for 7 days.
 After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day.
 The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals.
 Dosage should then be increased to 20 mg / day, as tolerated, because higher doses demonstrated better treatment effects in trials conducted in the United States.
 The efficacy and safety of doses above 20 mg / day have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
 A dose decrease down to 5 mg / day may be considered for patients who do not tolerate higher doses [see Clinical Studies].
 Although TRINTELLIX can be abruptly discontinued, in placebo - controlled trials patients experienced transient adverse reactions such as headache and muscle tension following abrupt discontinuation of TRINTELLIX 15 mg / day or 20 mg / day.
 To avoid these adverse reactions, it is recommended that the dose be decreased to 10 mg / day for one week before full discontinuation of TRINTELLIX 15 mg / day or 20 mg / day [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 The risk of administering methylene blue by non - intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg / kg with TRINTELLIX is unclear.
 The maximum recommended dose of TRINTELLIX is 10 mg / day in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.
 An initial intravenous Triostat dose ranging from 25 mcg to 50 mcg is recommended in the emergency treatment of myxedema coma / precoma in adults.
 In patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease, an initial dose of 10 mcg to 20 mcg is suggested (see WARNINGS).
 Review of the myxedema case reports indicates decreased mortality in patients receiving at least 65 mcg / day in the initial days of treatment.
 However, there is limited clinical experience at total daily doses above 100 mcg.
 Oral therapy should be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.
 Inject 0.5 mL of Tripedia (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine) vaccine intramuscularly only.

 The recommended dosage regimen of TRIUMEQ in adults is one tablet once daily orally with or without food.
 The dolutegravir dose (50 mg) in TRIUMEQ is insufficient when coadministered with medications listed in Table 1 that may decrease dolutegravir concentrations; the following dolutegravir dosage regimen is recommended.
 Because TRIUMEQ is a fixed - dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted, TRIUMEQ is not recommended in:
 The initial dose of TRIVARIS™ (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) 80 mg / mL may vary from 2.5 mg to 100 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
 The recommended intravitreal dose is a single injection of 4 mg per 0.05 mL (i.e., 50 microliters of 80 mg / mL suspension).
 This will provide the recommended dose of 4 mg per 0.05 mL.
 The suggested initial dose is 60 mg, injected deeply into the gluteal muscle.
 Dosage is usually adjusted within the range of 40 to 80 mg, depending upon patient response and duration of relief.
 However, some patients may be well controlled on doses as low as 20 mg or less.
 The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg / kg / day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg / m² bsa / day).

 In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of triamcinolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for one month, are recommended (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS).
 A single local injection of triamcinolone acetonide is frequently sufficient, but several injections may be needed for adequate relief of symptoms.
 Initial dose: 2.5 to 5 mg for smaller joints and from 5 to 15 mg for larger joints, depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
 For adults, doses up to 10 mg for smaller areas and up to 40 mg for larger areas have usually been sufficient.
 Single injections into several joints, up to a total of 80 mg, have been given.
 Trivora Tablets are a three - phase preparation plus 7 inert tablets.

 The recommended dosage regimen for TYGACIL is an initial dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg every 12 hours.
 The recommended duration of treatment with TYGACIL for complicated skin and skin structure infections or for complicated intra - abdominal infections is 5 to 14 days.
 The recommended duration of treatment with TYGACIL for community - acquired bacterial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days.
 In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), the initial dose of TYGACIL should be 100 mg followed by a reduced maintenance dose of 25 mg every 12 hours.
 Each vial of TYGACIL should be reconstituted with 5.3 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP to achieve a concentration of 10 mg / mL of tigecycline.
 Thus, 5 mL of reconstituted solution is equivalent to 50 mg of the drug.)
 Withdraw 5 mL of the reconstituted solution from the vial and add to a 100 mL intravenous bag for infusion (for a 100 mg dose, reconstitute two vials; for a 50 mg dose, reconstitute one vial).
 The maximum concentration in the intravenous bag should be 1 mg / mL.
 Alternatively, TYGACIL mixed with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP may be stored refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for up to 48 hours following immediate transfer of the reconstituted solution into the intravenous bag.
 The recommended dose of TYKERB is 1,250 mg given orally once daily on Days 1 - 21 continuously in combination with capecitabine 2,000 mg / m² / day (administered orally in 2 doses approximately 12 hours apart) on Days 1 - 14 in a repeating 21 - day cycle.
 The dose of TYKERB should be once daily (5 tablets administered all at once); dividing the daily dose is not recommended [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of TYKERB is 1,500 mg given orally once daily continuously in combination with letrozole.
 When coadministered with TYKERB, the recommended dose of letrozole is 2.5 mg once daily.
 The dose of TYKERB should be once daily (6 tablets administered all at once); dividing the daily dose is not recommended [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 TYKERB should be discontinued in patients with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) that is Grade 2 or greater by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v3) and in patients with an LVEF that drops below the institution's lower limit of normal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS].
 TYKERB in combination with capecitabine may be restarted at a reduced dose (1,000 mg / day) and in combination with letrozole may be restarted at a reduced dose of 1,250 mg / day after a minimum of 2 weeks if the LVEF recovers to normal and the patient is asymptomatic.
 A dose reduction from 1,250 mg / day to 750 mg / day (HER2 - positive metastatic breast cancer indication) or from 1,500 mg / day to 1,000 mg / day (hormone receptor - positive, HER2 - positive breast cancer indication) in patients with severe hepatic impairment is predicted to adjust the area under the curve (AUC) to the normal range and should be considered.
 TYKERB should be interrupted in patients with diarrhea which is NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 1 or 2 with complicating features (moderate to severe abdominal cramping, nausea or vomiting ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 2, decreased performance status, fever, sepsis, neutropenia, frank bleeding, or dehydration).
 TYKERB may be reintroduced at a lower dose (reduced from 1,250 mg / day to 1,000 mg / day or from 1,500 mg / day to 1,250 mg / day) when diarrhea resolves to Grade 1 or less.
 If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, based on pharmacokinetic studies, a dose reduction to 500 mg / day of lapatinib is predicted to adjust the lapatinib AUC to the range observed without inhibitors and should be considered.
 If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, based on pharmacokinetic studies, the dose of lapatinib should be titrated gradually from 1,250 mg / day up to 4,500 mg / day (HER2 - positive metastatic breast cancer indication) or from 1,500 mg / day up to 5,500 mg / day (hormone receptor - positive, HER2 - positive breast cancer indication) based on tolerability.
 Discontinuation or interruption of dosing with TYKERB may be considered when patients develop ≥ Grade 2 NCI CTCAE toxicity and can be restarted at the standard dose of 1,250 or 1,500 mg / day when the toxicity improves to Grade 1 or less.
 If the toxicity recurs, then TYKERB in combination with capecitabine should be restarted at a lower dose (1,000 mg / day) and in combination with letrozole should be restarted at a lower dose of 1,250 mg / day.
 Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects.
 The usual adult dosage is one TYLOX (oxycodone and acetaminophen capsules) capsule every 6 hours as needed for pain.
 The immunizing dose for adults and children is a single injection of 0.5 mL.
 A reimmunizing dose is 0.5 mL.

 Therapy should begin with 3 breaths of Tyvaso (18 mcg of treprostinil), per treatment session, 4 times daily.
 If 3 breaths are not tolerated, reduce to 1 or 2 breaths and subsequently increase to 3 breaths, as tolerated.
 Dosage should be increased by an additional 3 breaths at approximately 1 - 2 week intervals, if tolerated, until the target dose of 9 breaths (54 mcg of treprostinil) is reached per treatment session, 4 times daily.
 The maximum recommended dosage is 9 breaths per treatment session, 4 times daily.
 One ampule of Tyvaso contains a sufficient volume of medication for all 4 treatment sessions in a single day.
 Prior to the first treatment session, the patient should twist the top off a single Tyvaso ampule and squeeze the entire contents into the medicine cup.
 The recommended dose of Tyzeka for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B is 600 mg once daily, taken orally, with or without food.
 Tyzeka Oral Solution (30 mL) may be considered for patients who have difficulty with swallowing tablets.
 No adjustment to the recommended dose of Tyzeka is necessary in patients whose creatinine clearance is greater than or equal to 50 mL per min.
 Adjustment of the total daily dose of Tyzeka Oral Solution or of the interval for administration of Tyzeka tablets is required in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min including those with ESRD on hemodialysis (Table 1).
 For patients with incomplete viral suppression (HBV DNA greater than or equal to 300 copies per mL) after 24 weeks of treatment, alternate therapy should be instituted.
 The recommended dosage regimen is 1 metered dose administered rectally twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 metered dose administered rectally once daily for 4 weeks.
 The recommended dosage for the induction of remission in adult patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis is 9 mg taken orally once daily in the morning with or without food for up to 8 weeks.
 For treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout, ULORIC is recommended at 40 mg or 80 mg once daily.

 For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg / dL after two weeks with 40 mg, ULORIC 80 mg is recommended.
 The recommended starting dose of ULORIC is 40 mg once daily.
 For patients who do not achieve a sUA less than 6 mg / dL after two weeks with 40 mg, ULORIC 80 mg is recommended.
 During Induction of Anesthesia: ULTIVA (remifentanil) should be administered at an infusion rate of 0.5 to 1 mcg / kg / min with a hypnotic or volatile agent for the induction of anesthesia.
 If endotracheal intubation is to occur less than 8 minutes after the start of the infusion of ULTIVA (remifentanil) , then an initial dose of 1 mcg / kg may be administered over 30 to 60 seconds.
 Due to the fast onset and short duration of action of ULTIVA (remifentanil) , the rate of administration during anesthesia can be titrated upward in 25% to 100% increments in adult patients or up to 50% increments in pediatric patients, or downward in 25% to 50% decrements every 2 to 5 minutes to attain the desired level of μ - opioid effect.
 In response to light anesthesia or transient episodes of intense surgical stress, supplem ental bolus doses of 1 mcg / kg may be administered every 2 to 5 minutes.
 At infusion rates > 1 mcg / kg / min, increases in the concomitant anesthetic agents should be considered to increase the depth of anesthesia.
 Single Dose: A single IV dose of 0.5 to 1 mcg / kg over 30 to 60 seconds of ULTIVA (remifentanil) may be given 90 seconds before the placement of the local or regional anesthetic block (see PRECAUTIONS).
 Because of the risk for hypoventilation, the infusion rate of ULTIVA (remifentanil) should be decreased to 0.05 mcg / kg / min following placement of the block.
 Thereafter, rate adjustments of 0.025 mcg / kg / min at 5 - minute intervals may be used to balance the patient's level of analgesia and respiratory rate.
 Use in Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery: Table 13 summarizes the recommended doses for induction, maintenance, and continuation as an analgesic into the ICU in adult patients, predominantly ASA physical status III or IV.
 Preparation for Administration: To reconstitute solution, add 1 mL of diluent per mg of remifentanil.
 When reconstituted as directed, the solution contains approximately 1 mg of remifentanil activity per 1 mL.
 ULTIVA (remifentanil) should be diluted to a recommended final concentration of 20, 25, 50, or 250 mcg / mL prior to administration (see Table 14).
 When ULTIVA (remifentanil) is used as an analgesic component of monitored analgesia care, a final concentration of 25 mcg / mL is recommended.
 When ULTIVA (remifentanil) is used for pediatric patients 1 year of age and older, a final concentration of 20 or 25 mcg / mL is recommended.

 To obtain radiation absorbed dose in rads (30 mCi dose) from the above table, divide individual organ values by a factor of 10 (does not apply for effective dose).
 The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an ADULT patient from the nasolacrimal imaging procedure using a maximum dose of 3.7 megabecquerels (100 microcuries) of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m are shown in Table 7.
 In pediatric patients, an average 30 minute exposure to 37 MBq (1 mCi) of Tc - 99m pertechnetate following instillation for direct cystography, will result in the following estimated radiation doses:
 For the short - term (five days or less) management of acute pain, the recommended dose of ULTRACET® is 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief, up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day.
 In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL / min, it is recommended that the dosing interval of ULTRACET® be increased not to exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours.
 For patients with moderate to moderately severe chronic pain not requiring rapid onset of analgesic effect, the tolerability of ULTRAM® can be improved by initiating therapy with the following titration regimen: ULTRAM® should be started at 25 mg / day (half ULTRAM® scored tablet) qAM and titrated in 25 mg increments as separate doses every 3 days to reach 100 mg / day (25 mg q.i.d.).
 Thereafter the total daily dose may be increased by 50 mg as tolerated every 3 days to reach 200 mg / day (50 mg q.i.d.)
 After titration, ULTRAM® 50 to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every 4 to 6 hours not to exceed 400 mg / day.
 For the subset of patients for whom rapid onset of analgesic effect is required and for whom the benefits outweigh the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events associated with higher initial doses, ULTRAM® 50 mg to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 400 mg per day.
 In all patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min, it is recommended that the dosing interval of ULTRAM® be increased to 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg.
 The recommended dose for adult patients with cirrhosis is 50 mg every 12 hours.
 For elderly patients over 75 years old, total dose should not exceed 300 mg / day.

 Suggestions For The Use Of Pancreatic Enzymes In Cystic Fibrosis 13
 Treatment beyond two weeks is not recommended and the total dosage should not exceed 50 grams (50 mL) per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal (HPA) axis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 Do not exceed 225 mL as total dose for the procedure.
 Table 1: Suggested Single Injection Doses for Adult Intra - Arterial Procedures
 Inject 1 to 2 milliliters per kilogram (mL / kg).
 Do not exceed 4 mL / kg as total dose.
 Inject 1 to 2 mL / kg.
 Do not exceed 3 mL / kg as total dose.
 ULTRESA should be administered to infants immediately prior to each feeding, using a dosage of 4,000 lipase units (one capsule) per 120 mL of formula or per breast - feeding.
 Contents of the capsule may be administered with a small amount of applesauce, or other acidic food with a pH of 4.5 or less (e.g., commercially available preparations of bananas, or pears).
 For patients who are unable to swallow intact capsules, the capsules may be carefully opened and the contents sprinkled on a small amount of soft acidic food with pH of 4.5 or less such as applesauce or yogurt at room temperature.
 Dosage recommendations for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy were published following the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Consensus Conferences.1,2,3 ULTRESA should be administered in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the Conferences provided in the following paragraphs, with one exception.
 The Conferences recommend doses of 2,000 to 4,000 lipase units in infants up to 12 months.
 ULTRESA is available in a 4,000 lipase unit capsule.
 The recommended dose of ULTRESA in infants up to 12 months is 4,000 lipase units.
 Infants may be given 4,000 lipase units (one capsule) per 120 mL of formula or per breast - feeding.
 Enzyme dosing should begin with 1,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal for children less than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day.
 Enzyme dosing should begin with 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal for those older than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day.
 The total daily dosage should reflect approximately three meals plus two or three snacks per day.
 If doses are to exceed 2,500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal, further investigation is warranted.
 Patients currently receiving higher doses than 6,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal should be examined and the dosage either immediately decreased or titrated downward to a lower range.
 For IV administration, the dose can be given by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 – 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 – 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 – 30 minutes.
 The recommended adult dosage of UNASYN is 1.5 g (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) to 3 g (2 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) every six hours.
 This 1.5 to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of UNASYN, and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin / 0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin / 1 g sulbactam.
 The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day.
 The recommended daily dose of UNASYN in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours.
 This 300 mg / kg / day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of UNASYN, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin / 100 mg sulbactam per kg per day.
 Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day.
 In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function.
 1.5 g and 3.0 g Bottles
 Initially, the vials may be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection to yield solutions containing 375 mg UNASYN per mL (250 mg ampicillin / 125 mg sulbactam per mL).
 An appropriate volume should then be immediately diluted with a suitable parenteral diluent to yield solutions containing 3 to 45 mg UNASYN per mL (2 to 30 mg ampicillin / 1 to 15 mg sulbactam / per mL).
 1.5 g ADD - Vantage® Vials

 1.5 g and 3.0 g Standard Vials
 Consult the following table for recommended volumes to be added to obtain solutions containing 375 mg UNASYN per mL (250 mg ampicillin / 125 mg sulbactam per mL).
 Uniphyl (theophylline anhydrous tablet) ® 400 or 600 mg Tablets can be taken once a day in the morning or evening.
 It is recommended that Uniphyl (theophylline anhydrous tablet) be taken with meals.
 Patients should be advised that if they choose to take Uniphyl (theophylline anhydrous tablet) with food it should be taken consistently with food and if they take it in a fasted condition it should routinely be taken fasted.
 Uniphyl (theophylline anhydrous tablet) ® Tablets are not to be chewed or crushed because it may lead to a rapid release of theophylline with the potential for toxicity.
 Infrequently, patients receiving Uniphyl (theophylline anhydrous tablet) 400 or 600 mg Tablets may pass an intact matrix tablet in the stool or via colostomy.
 Stabilized patients, 12 years of age or older, who are taking an immediate - release or controlled - release theophylline product may be transferred to once - daily administration of 400 mg or 600 mg Uniphyl (theophylline anhydrous tablet) Tablets on a mg - for - mg basis.
 For example, at a dose of 900 mg / d in adults < 60 years or 22 mg / kg / d in children 1 - 9 years, the steady - state peak serum theophylline concentration will be < 10 mcg / mL in about 30% of patients, 10 - 20 mcg / mL in about 50% and 20 - 30 mcg / mL in about 20% of patients.
 In children 12 - 15 years of age, the theophylline dose should not exceed 16 mg / kg / day up to a maximum of 400 mg / day in the presence of risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.
 In adolescents ≥ 16 years and adults, including the elderly, the theophylline dose should not exceed 400 mg / day in the presence of risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.
 The recommended dosage range of moexipril is 7.5 to 30 mg daily, administered in a single or two divided doses one hour before meals, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in a dosage of 12.5 to 50 mg daily.
 In uniretic® controlled clinical trials, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 3.75 mg / 6.25 mg or 7.5 mg / 12.5 mg, but subjects who received 15 mg / 12.5 mg or 15 mg / 25 mg experienced a mild decrease in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by subjects who received the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.
 A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either moexipril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be given uniretic® 7.5 mg / 12.5 mg, uniretic® 15 mg / 12.5 mg or uniretic® 15 mg / 25 mg one hour before a meal.
 Total daily doses above 30 mg / 50 mg a day have not been studied in hypertensive patients.
 Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to moexipril 3.75 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg (onehalf of the uniretic® 7.5 mg / 12.5 mg tablet).
 For patients who experience an excessive reduction in blood pressure with uniretic® 7.5 mg / 12.5 mg, the physician may consider prescribing moexipril 3.75 mg / hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg.
 The usual dosage regimen of uniretic® does not need to be adjusted as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 40 mL / min / 1.73 m² (serum creatinine approximately ≤ 3 mg / dL or 265 μmol / L).
 The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg / kg / day (e.g., 100 - 125 mcg / day for a 70 kg adult).
 Older patients may require less than 1 mcg / kg / day.
 Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg / day are seldom required.
 An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg / day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and / or drug interactions.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day, with gradual dose increments at 4 - 6 week intervals.
 In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5 - 25 mcg / day with increases of 25 mcg / day every 2 - 4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.
 The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10 - 15 mcg / kg / day.
 A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg / day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4 - 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment.
 In infants with very low ( < 5 mcg / dL) or undetectable serum T4 concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium.
 However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg / day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2 - 4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.
 If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg / kg / day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level.
 Generally, TSH is suppressed to < 0.1 mU / L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg / kg / day.

 For pediatric kidney transplant patients 4 months to 16 years of age, the recommended once daily mg dose (7x BSA x CrCL) should start within 10 days of post - transplantation until 200 days post - transplantation.
 For pediatric heart transplant patients 1 month to 16 years of age, the recommended once daily mg dose (7x BSA x CrCL) should start within 10 days of transplantation until 100 days post - transplantation.
 Pediatric Dose (mg) = 7 x BSA x CrCl (calculated using a modified Schwartz formula).
 If the calculated Schwartz creatinine clearance exceeds 150 mL / min / 1.73m², then a maximum value of 150 mL / min / 1.73m² should be used in the equation.
 All calculated doses should be rounded to the nearest 10 mg increment for the actual deliverable dose.
 If the calculated dose exceeds 900 mg, a maximum dose of 900 mg should be administered.
 VALCYTE for oral solution is the preferred formulation since it provides the ability to administer a dose calculated according to the formula above; however, VALCYTE tablets may be used if the calculated doses are within 10% of available tablet strength (450 mg).
 For example, if the calculated dose is between 405 mg and 495 mg, one 450 mg tablet may be taken.
 VALSTAR (valrubicin) is recommended at a dose of 800 mg administered intravesically once a week for six weeks.
 For each instillation, four 5 mL vials (200 mg valrubicin / 5 mL vial) should be allowed to warm slowly to room temperature, but should not be heated.
 Twenty milliliters of VALSTAR (valrubicin) should then be withdrawn from the four vials and diluted with 55 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP providing 75 mL of a diluted VALSTAR (valrubicin) solution.

 DOSAGE TABLE FOR VANCOMYCIN IN PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION (Adapted from Moellering et al)4
 The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg / kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
 For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg / kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations.
 The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg / kg / 24 h. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis.
 In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended.
 Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions: (1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity.
 The recommended dose is one applicator full of VANDAZOLE (metronidazole vaginal gel) , (approximately 5 grams of gel containing approximately 37.5 mg of metronidazole) administered intravaginally once a day for 5 days.
 The recommended dose of VANTAS is one implant for 12 months.
 Each implant contains 50 mg histrelin acetate to deliver 41 mg histrelin.
 The implant is inserted subcutaneously in the inner aspect of the upper arm and provides continuous release of histrelin (50 mcg / day) for 12 months of hormonal therapy.
 NOTE: The Implantation Kit is to be stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature] only.
 When fully inserted, the implant rests inside the cannula so that just the tip of the implant is visible at the beveled end of the cannula.
 Note that the Implantation Kit is to be stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature] only.
 Males(mL / min): Weight (kg) x (140 - age) / 72 x serum creatinine (mg / 100 mL)
 Females(mL / min): 0.85 x above value
 After mixing, the suspension should be stored in a refrigerator, 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F).
 VANTRELA ER 90 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 60 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Do not exceed a dose of 90 mg every 12 hours (180 mg per day).
 Initiate treatment with VANTRELA ER with the 15 mg tablet orally every 12 hours.
 The starting dosage for patients who are not opioid tolerant is VANTRELA ER 15 mg orally every 12 hours.
 Patients receiving other oral hydrocodone bitartrate formulations may be converted to VANTRELA ER by administering one half of the patient's total daily oral hydrocodone bitartrate dose as VANTRELA ER every 12 hours.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to VANTRELA ER:
 Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion and there is limited experience with this conversion, a conservative hydrocodone dose, approximately 15 mg every 12 hours of VANTRELA ER, should be used initially.
 In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, initiate therapy with one half of the recommended initial dose followed by careful dose titration.
 Initiate therapy with one half of the recommended initial dose of VANTRELA ER and titrate carefully.
 Initiate with a loading dose of 20 mg VAPRISOL administered intravenously over 30 minutes.
 Follow the loading dose with 20 mg VAPRISOL administered in a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours.
 After the initial day of treatment, administer VAPRISOL for an additional 1 to 3 days in a continuous infusion of 20 mg / day.
 If serum sodium is not rising at the desired rate, VAPRISOL may be titrated upward to a maximum dose of 40 mg daily, administered in a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours.
 In patients with moderate (Child - Pugh Class B) and severe (Child - Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, initiate VAPRISOL with a loading dose of 10 mg over 30 minutes followed by 10 mg per day as a continuous infusion for 2 to 4 days.
 If serum sodium is not rising at the desired rate, VAPRISOL may be titrated upward to 20 mg per day [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

 Adult patients: It is wise to initiate therapy for adults by administering a single intravenous dose of 3.7 mg / m2 of body surface area (bsa).
 First dose ........................... 3.7 mg / m2 bsa
 Second dose ...................... 5.5 mg / m2 bsa
 Third dose .......................... 7.4 mg / m2 bsa
 Fourth dose ........................ 9.25 mg / m2 bsa
 Fifth dose ........................... 11.1 mg / m2 bsa
 The dose should not be increased after that dose which reduces the white - cell count to approximately 3000 cells / mm3.
 For most adult patients, however, the weekly dosage will prove to be 5.5 to 7.4 mg / m2 bsa.
 When the dose of vinblastine sulfate (vinblastine sulfate injection) which will produce the above degree of leukopenia has been established, a dose of 1 increment smaller than this should be administered at weekly intervals for maintenance.
 Pediatric Patients: A review of published literature from 1993 to 1995 showed that initial doses of vinblastine sulfate (vinblastine sulfate injection) in pediatric patients varied depending on the schedule used and whether vinblastine sulfate (vinblastine sulfate injection) was administered as a single agent or incorporated within a particular chemotherapeutic regimen.
 As a single agent for Letterer - Siwe disease (histiocytosis X), the initial dose of vinblastine sulfate (vinblastine sulfate injection) was reported as 6.5 mg / m2.
 For testicular germ cell carcinomas, the initial dose of vinblastine sulfate (vinblastine sulfate injection) was reported as 3 mg / m2 in a combination regimen.
 To prepare a solution containing 1 mg / mL of vinblastine sulfate (vinblastine sulfate injection) , add 10 mL of Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection (preserved with benzyl alcohol) or 10 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection (unpreserved) to the 10 mg of Vinblastine Sulfate (vinblastine sulfate injection) for Injection in the sterile vial.
 The dose should not be diluted in large volumes of diluent (i.e., 100 to 250 mL) or given intravenously for prolonged periods (ranging from 30 to 60 minutes or more), since this frequently results in irritation of the vein and increases the chance of extravasation.
 The usual dose of VINCASAR PFS for pediatric patients is 1.5 to 2 mg / m².
 For pediatric patients weighing 10 kg or less, the starting dose should be 0.05 mg / kg, administered once a week.
 The usual dose of VINCASAR PFS for adults is 1.4 mg / m².

 The recommended starting VPRIV dosage in naïve adults and naïve pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is 60 Units / kg administered every other week as a 60 - minute intravenous infusion.
 The maximum recommended dose is 6 mg daily.
 In short - term controlled trials, dosages above 6 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose - related adverse reactions [see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Studies].
 The recommended dose range is 1.5 mg to 6 mg once daily.
 The starting dose of VRAYLAR is 1.5 mg.
 The dosage can be increased to 3 mg on Day 2.
 Depending upon clinical response and tolerability, further dose adjustments can be made in 1.5 mg or 3 mg increments.
 The recommended dose range is 3 mg to 6 mg once daily.
 The starting dose of VRAYLAR is 1.5 mg and should be increased to 3 mg on Day 2.
 Depending upon clinical response and tolerability, further dose adjustments can be made in 1.5 mg or 3 mg increments.
 For patients taking 4.5 mg daily, the dosage should be reduced to 1.5 mg or 3 mg daily.
 For patients taking 1.5 mg daily, the dosing regimen should be adjusted to every other day.
 Dosage recommendation for patients initiating VRAYLAR therapy while already on a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor: Patients should be administered 1.5 mg of VRAYLAR on Day 1 and on Day 3 with no dose administered on Day 2.
 From Day 4 onward, the dose should be administered at 1.5 mg daily, then increased to a maximum dose of 3 mg daily.
 In one study, childhood ALL patients failing induction therapy with a cytarabine - containing regimen were treated with the combination of VUMON 165 mg / m² and cytarabine 300 mg / m² intravenously, twice weekly for 8 to 9 doses.
 In another study, patients with childhood ALL refractory to vincristine / prednisone - containing regimens were treated with the combination of VUMON 250 mg / m² and vincristine 1.5 mg / m² intravenously, weekly for 4 to 8 weeks and prednisone 40 mg / m² orally for 28 days.
 VUMON must be diluted with either 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to give final teniposide concentrations of 0.1 mg / mL, 0.2 mg / mL, 0.4 mg / mL, or 1.0 mg / mL.
 Solutions prepared in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP at teniposide concentrations of 0.1 mg / mL, 0.2 mg / mL, or 0.4 mg / mL are stable at room temperature for up to 24 hours after preparation.
 Precipitation has been reported during 24 - hour infusions of VUMON diluted to teniposide concentrations of 0.1 to 0.2 mg / mL, resulting in occlusion of central venous access catheters in several patients.
 In a 24 - hour study under simulated conditions of actual use of the product relative to dilution strength, diluent and administration rates, dilutions at 0.1 to 1.0 mg / mL were chemically stable for at least 24 hours.
 The usual dosage range is 10 / 10 mg / day to 10 / 40 mg / day.
 The recommended usual starting dose is 10 / 10 mg / day or 10 / 20 mg / day.
 VYTORIN should be taken as a single daily dose in the evening, with or without food.
 Patients who require a larger reduction in LDL - C (greater than 55%) may be started at 10 / 40 mg / day in the absence of moderate to severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL / min / 1.73 m²).
 Due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, particularly during the first year of treatment, use of the 10 / 80 - mg dose of VYTORIN should be restricted to patients who have been taking VYTORIN 10 / 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 The recommended dosage for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is VYTORIN 10 / 40 mg / day in the evening [see Restricted Dosing for 10 / 80 mg].
 VYTORIN dosage should not exceed 10 / 20 mg / day (or 10 / 40 mg / day for patients who have previously taken simvastatin 80 mg / day chronically, e.g., for 12 months or more, without evidence of muscle toxicity) while taking lomitapide.
 In patients with chronic kidney disease and estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL / min / 1.73 m², the dose of VYTORIN is 10 / 20 mg / day in the evening.
 Because of an increased risk for myopathy in Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 g / day niacin) of niacin - containing products, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with VYTORIN doses exceeding 10 / 20 mg / day coadministered with lipid - modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 g / day niacin) of niacin - containing products.
 Because the risk for myopathy is dose - related, Chinese patients should not receive VYTORIN 10 / 80 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses of niacin - containing products.

 The usual starting dose is 32.5 mg, with increment of 16.25 mg every 2 to 3 weeks.
 A lower starting dosage, 16.25 mg / day, is recommended in patients with longstanding myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended.
 Most patients require 65 - 130 mg / day.
 Failure to respond to doses of 195 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption.
 Maintenance dosages 65 - 130 mg / day usually result in normal serum T4 and T3 levels.
 Levothyroxine sodium (T4) is given at a starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg / mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly.
 This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given IV.
 Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.
 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone.
 For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T4) is 1.56 mg / kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days.
 The average adult dose is 2 tablets at the start of a vascular headache (migraine) attack; followed by 1 additional tablet every 1 / 2 hour if needed, up to 6 tablets per attack.
 Total weekly dosage should not exceed 10 tablets.
 Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired VWF:RCo rise (%) (IU / dL) x 0.5 (IU / kg per IU / dL)
 Epected VWF:RCo rise (% of normal) = 2 x administered IU / body weight (kg)
 Table 1 : Dosing for Treatment of Minor and Major Hemorrhages in all VWD types
 Table 2 : Dosing for Treatment in Minor and Major Surgeries in all VWD Types
 Assumption: Baseline VWF:RCo value = 10 IU / dL, and VWF:RCo target level = 100 IU / dL = Δ 90 IU / dL
 Assumption: Patient's weight = 75 kg, patient's IVR = 1.8 (IU / dL) / (IU / kg)
 Loading Dose = 90 IU / dL x 75 kg / 1.8 (IU / dL) / (IU / kg) = 3,750 IU VWF:RCo
 Figure 1 and 2
 An initial dose of 250 international unit / kg (50 mcg / kg) body weight, given as a single injection is recommended for the treatment of ITP.
 The initial dose may be administered in two divided doses given on separate days, if desired.
 If the patient has a hemoglobin level less than 10 g / dL, a reduced dose of 125 to 200 international unit / kg (25 to 40 mcg / kg) should be given to minimize the risk of increasing the severity of anemia in the patient.
 If subsequent therapy is required to elevate platelet counts, an intravenous dose of 125 to 300 international unit / kg (25 to 60 mcg / kg) body weight of WinRho® SDF is recommended.
 If a patient responded to initial dose with a satisfactory increase in platelets, maintenance dose at 125 to 300 international unit / kg (25 to 60 mcg / kg), individualized based on platelet and Hgb levels.
 If Hgb between 8 - 10 g / dL, redose between 125 to 200 international unit / kg (25 to 40 mcg / kg).
 If Hgb > 10 g / dL, redose between 250 to 300 international unit / kg (50 to 60 mcg / kg).
 Safety and efficacy of WinRho® SDF in the treatment of ITP at doses exceeding 300 international unit / kg (60 mcg / kg) has not been established.
 It is recommended that the patient be started on 2 mg, three times a day.
 After a favorable initial response is obtained in terms of prevention of episodes of edematous attacks, the proper continuing dosage should be determined by decreasing the dosage at intervals of one to three months to a maintenance dosage of 2 mg a day.
 Some patients may be successfully managed on a 2 mg alternate day schedule.
 The recommended starting dosage of XADAGO is 50 mg administered orally once daily (at the same time of day), without regard to meals.
 After two weeks, the dosage may be increased to 100 mg once daily, based on individual need and tolerability.
 Daily dosages of XADAGO above 100 mg have not been shown to provide additional benefit, and higher dosages increase the risk for adverse reactions.
 XADAGO 100 mg should be tapered by decreasing the dose to 50 mg for one week before stopping [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh B: 7 - 9), the maximum recommended dosage of XADAGO is 50 mg orally once daily.
 If a patient taking 50 mg XADAGO progresses from moderate to severe hepatic impairment, discontinue XADAGO.
 The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
 If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as normal.
 The dosage of XALATAN should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including XALATAN is not recommended.
 If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart.
 The recommended dose of XALKORI is 250 mg orally, twice daily until disease progression or no longer tolerated by the patient.
 The recommended dose of XALKORI in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 30 mL / min] not requiring dialysis is 250 mg orally, once daily [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Reduce dose as below, if 1 or more dose reductions are necessary due to adverse reactions of Grade 3 or 4 severity, as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0:
 While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some who require doses greater than 4 mg / day.
 Treatment for patients with anxiety should be initiated with a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg given three times daily.
 The dose may be increased to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect, at intervals of 3 to 4 days, to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses.
 Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days.
 The successful treatment of many panic disorder patients has required the use of XANAX at doses greater than 4 mg daily.
 In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of XANAX in panic disorder, doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg daily were used.
 The mean dosage employed was approximately 5 to 6 mg daily.
 Among the approximately 1700 patients participating in the panic disorder development program, about 300 received XANAX in dosages of greater than 7 mg / day, including approximately 100 patients who received maximum dosages of greater than 9 mg / day.
 Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg a day to achieve a successful response.
 Treatment may be initiated with a dose of 0.5 mg three times daily.
 Depending on the response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day.
 For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg / day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised.
 In a controlled postmarketing dose - response study, patients treated with doses of XANAX greater than 4 mg / day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit.
 Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days.
 In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.
 It is suggested that the dose be reduced by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days, with the understanding that some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation.
 In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease or in patients with debilitating disease, the usual starting dose is 0.25 mg, given two or three times daily.
 The suggested total daily dose ranges between 3 to 6 mg / day.
 While the suggested total daily dosages given will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some patients who require doses greater than 6 mg / day.
 In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease, or in patients with debilitating disease, the usual starting dose of XANAX XR is 0.5 mg once daily.
 Treatment with XANAX XR may be initiated with a dose of 0.5 mg to 1 mg once daily.
 Depending on the response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg / day.
 In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of XANAX XR Tablets in panic disorder, doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg / day were used.
 Most patients showed efficacy in the dose range of 3 to 6 mg / day.
 Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg / day to achieve a successful response.
 Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days.
 In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.
 It is suggested that the dose be reduced by no more than 0.5 mg every three days, with the understanding that some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation.
 The 15 mg and 20 mg XARELTO tablets should be taken with food, while the 10 mg tablet can be taken with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Switching from Warfarin to XARELTO - When switching patients from warfarin to XARELTO, discontinue warfarin and start XARELTO as soon as the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is below 3.0 to avoid periods of inadequate anticoagulation.
 One approach is to discontinue XARELTO and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of XARELTO would have been taken.
 For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 mL / min, the recommended dose of XARELTO is 20 mg taken orally once daily with the evening meal.
 For patients with CrCl 15 to 50 mL / min, the recommended dose is 15 mg once daily with the evening meal [see Use in Specific Populations].
 The recommended dose of XARELTO for the initial treatment of acute DVT and / or PE is 15 mg taken orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days.

 For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg XARELTO tablets may be crushed and mixed with applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally.
 After the administration of a crushed XARELTO 15 mg or 20 mg tablet, the dose should be immediately followed by food [see sections above and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Administration via nasogastric (NG) tube or gastric feeding tube: After confirming gastric placement of the tube, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg XARELTO tablets may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via an NG tube or gastric feeding tube.
 After the administration of a crushed XARELTO 15 mg or 20 mg tablet, the dose should then be immediately followed by enteral feeding [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Crushed 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg XARELTO tablets are stable in water and in applesauce for up to 4 hours.
 An in vitro compatibility study indicated that there is no adsorption of rivaroxaban from a water suspension of a crushed XARELTO tablet to PVC or silicone nasogastric (NG) tubing.
 The recommended dose of XARTEMIS XR is 2 tablets every 12 hours administered with or without food.
 The second dose of 2 tablets may be administered as early as 8 hours after the initial dose if patients require analgesia at that time.
 Subsequent doses are to be administered 2 tablets every 12 hours.
 XARTEMIS XR tablets should be swallowed whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in mouth [see PATIENT INFORMATION].
 The total daily dose of acetaminophen from all drug products should not exceed 4000 milligrams.
 In patients with hepatic impairment start with one tablet and adjust dosage as needed.

 The recommended dose of XELODA is 1250 mg / m2 administered orally twice daily (morning and evening; equivalent to 2500 mg / m2 total daily dose) for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period given as 3 - week cycles (see Table 1).
 Adjuvant treatment in patients with Dukes' C colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months [ie, XELODA 1250 mg / m2 orally twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period, given as 3 - week cycles for a total of 8 cycles (24 weeks)].
 In combination with docetaxel, the recommended dose of XELODA is 1250 mg / m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period, combined with docetaxel at 75 mg / m2 as a 1 - hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.
 Table 1 displays the total daily dose of XELODA by body surface area and the number of tablets to be taken at each dose.
 In patients with moderate renal impairment (baseline creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL / min), a dose reduction to 75% of the XELODA starting dose when used as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel (from 1250 mg / m2 to 950 mg / m2 twice daily) is recommended [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The starting dose should be 12.5 mg per day given once in the morning.
 After one week, the dose should be increased to 25 mg per day given as 12.5 mg twice a day.
 XENAZINE should be titrated up slowly at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg daily, to allow the identification of a tolerated dose that reduces chorea.
 If a dose of 37.5 to 50 mg per day is needed, it should be given in a three times a day regimen.
 The maximum recommended single dose is 25 mg.
 Patients who require doses of XENAZINE greater than 50 mg per day should be first tested and genotyped to determine if they are poor metabolizers (PMs) or extensive metabolizers (EMs) by their ability to express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6.
 Genotyped patients who are identified as extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs) of CYP2D6, who need doses of XENAZINE above 50 mg per day, should be titrated up slowly at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg daily, to allow the identification of a tolerated dose that reduces chorea.
 Doses above 50 mg per day should be given in a three times a day regimen.
 The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg and the maximum recommended single dose is 37.5 mg.
 In PMs, the initial dose and titration is similar to EMs except that the recommended maximum single dose is 25 mg, and the recommended daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Medications that are strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as quinidine or antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) significantly increase the exposure to α - HTBZ and β - HTBZ, therefore, the total dose of XENAZINE should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg and the maximum single dose should not exceed 25 mg [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTION, DRUG INTERACTIONS, Use In Specific Populations, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of XENICAL is one 120 - mg capsule three times a day with each main meal containing fat (during or up to 1 hour after the meal).

 The recommended initial total dose of XEOMIN for cervical dystonia is 120 Units.
 In a placebo - controlled trial utilizing initial XEOMIN doses of 120 Units and 240 Units, no meaningful difference in effectiveness was demonstrated between the doses [see Clinical Studies].
 In a placebo - controlled trial in which patients were dosed with the same number of Units as they had received previously with onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), the mean dose per eye was about 33 Units (range 10 Units - 50 Units), and the mean number of injections per eye was 6.
 The maximum dose per eye in the controlled trials was 50 Units, with a range of 10 Units - 50 Units.
 If the previous dose of Botox is not known, the initial dose of XEOMIN should be between 1.25 Units - 2.5 Units / injection site.
 The total initial dose of XEOMIN in both eyes should not exceed 70 Units (35 Units / eye).
 The total recommended XEOMIN dose is 20 Units per treatment session divided into five equal intramuscular injections of 4 Units each.
 The five injection sites are: two injections in each corrugator muscle and one injection in the procerus muscle.
 After reconstitution, XEOMIN should be used for only one injection session and for only one patient.
 A suitable sterile needle (e.g., 26 - gauge (0.45 mm diameter), 37 mm length for superficial muscles; or 22 - gauge (0.70 mm diameter), 75 mm length for injections into deeper muscles) should be used in the administration in the treatment of cervical dystonia.
 A suitable sterile needle (e.g., 26 - gauge (0.45 mm diameter), 37 mm length for superficial muscles; or 22 - gauge (0.70 mm diameter), 75 mm length for injections into deeper muscles) should be used in the administration in the treatment of blepharospasm.
 The recommended dosage of Xermelo in adult patients is 250 mg three times daily for patients whose diarrhea is inadequately controlled by SSA therapy.
 The recommended dose of Xgeva is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months.
 All patients should receive calcium 1000 mg daily and at least 400 IU vitamin D daily [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].

 Instill one drop of Xiidra twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) into each eye using a single - use container.
 The recommended dosage of Ximino is approximately 1 mg / kg once daily for 12 weeks.
 The following table shows capsule strength and body weight to achieve approximately 1 mg / kg.
 The dose regimen of Xofigo is 55 kBq (1.49 microcurie) per kg body weight, given at 4 week intervals for 6 injections.
 The dose calibrator must be calibrated with nationally recognized standards, carried out at the time of commissioning, after any maintenance procedure that could affect the dosimetry and at intervals not to exceed one year.
 The fraction emitted as beta - particles is 3.6%, and the fraction emitted as gamma - radiation is 1.1%.
 The external radiation exposure associated with handling of patient doses is expected to be low, because the typical treatment activity will be below 8,000 kBq (216 microcurie).
 Administer Xolair 75 to 375 mg by subcutaneous injection every 2 or 4 weeks.
 Adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older: Initiate dosing according to Table 1 or 2.
 Table 3: Subcutaneous Xolair Doses Every 2 or 4 Weeks* for Pediatric Patients with Asthma Who Begin Xolair Between the Ages of 6 to < 12 Years
 Administer Xolair 150 or 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks.
 Do not administer more than 150 mg (contents of one vial) per injection site.
 Divide doses of more than 150 mg among two or more injection sites (Table 4).
 The recommended dosage of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution for patients 6 - 11 years old is 0.31 mg administered three times a day, by nebulization.
 Routine dosing should not exceed 0.63 mg three times a day.
 The recommended starting dosage of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution for patients 12 years of age and older is 0.63 mg administered three times a day, every 6 to 8 hours, by nebulization.
 Patients 12 years of age and older with more severe asthma or patients who do not respond adequately to a dose of 0.63 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution may benefit from a dosage of 1.25 mg three times a day.
 The safety and efficacy of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution have been established in clinical trials when administered using the PARI LC Jet™ and PARI LC Plus™ nebulizers, and the PARI Master® Dura - Neb® 2000 and Dura - Neb® 3000 compressors.
 The recommended dosage of XOPENEX HFA for adults and children 4 years of age and older is 2 inhalations (90 mcg of levalbuterol free base) repeated every 4 to 6 hours; in some patients, 1 inhalation (45 mg of levalbuterol free base) every 4 hours may be sufficient.
 XTAMPZA ER single doses greater than 36 mg (equivalent to 40 mg oxycodone hydrochloride [HCl]) or a total daily dose greater than 72 mg (equivalent to 80 mg oxycodone HCl) are to be administered only to patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established.
 Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone HCl per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 The maximum daily dose of XTAMPZA ER is 288 mg per day (eight 36 mg capsules, equivalent to 320 mg oxycodone HCl per day) as the safety of the excipients in XTAMPZA ER for doses over 288 mg / day has not been established.
 Initiate treatment with XTAMPZA ER with one 9 mg capsule orally every 12 hours with food.
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is XTAMPZA ER 9 mg orally every 12 hours with food.
 Initiate dosing using XTAMPZA ER 9 mg orally every 12 hours with food.
 Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 9 mg (equivalent to 10 mg oxycodone HCl) every 12 hours of XTAMPZA ER, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch.
 The recommended dose of XTANDI is 160 mg (four 40 mg capsules) administered orally once daily.
 If a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable side effect, withhold dosing for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg), if warranted.
 If patients must be co - administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, reduce the XTANDI dose to 80 mg once daily.
 If patients must be co - administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, increase the XTANDI dose from 160 mg to 240 mg once daily.
 Instill four drops into the affected ear(s) twice daily for seven days.
 For patients requiring use of an otowick, the initial dose can be doubled (to 8 drops), followed by 4 drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.
 A new patch is applied each week for 3 weeks (21 total days).
 Only one patch should be worn at a time.
 The woman has two options for starting the patch and she should choose the option that is right for her:
 Only one patch should be worn at a time.
 Table 1 presents the units of insulin degludec and the milligrams of liraglutide in each dosage of XULTOPHY 100 / 3.6.
 Table 1: Units of Insulin Degludec and Milligrams of Liraglutide in Each Dosage of XULTOPHY 100 / 3.6

 The recommended starting dosage of oral XURIDEN is 60 mg / kg once daily.
 Increase the dosage of XURIDEN to 120 mg / kg (not to exceed 8 grams) once daily for insufficient efficacy, such as occurrence of one of the following:
 The XURIDEN dose to be administered at the 60 mg / kg and 120 mg / kg dose levels by body - weight is presented in Tables 1 and 2.
 Therefore, in the tables below for patients requiring doses in multiples of 2 grams (¾ teaspoon) an entire packet(s) may be administered without weighing or measuring.
 Table 1: XURIDEN 60 mg / kg§ Dose Level
 XURIDEN can be mixed with milk or infant formula instead of the soft foods described above for patients receiving up to 3 / 4 teaspoon (2 grams) of XURIDEN.
 For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single dose vial containing Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 0.5% Injection should be used.
 Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block, provided they are employed as single dose units.
 In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2 – 3 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome).
 As a precaution against the adverse experience sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 2 to 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine HCl should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block.
 Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10 to 15 mcg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection.
 In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter.
 For normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg / kg (3.5 mg / lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg.
 When used without epinephrine the maximum individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg / kg (2 mg / lb) of body weight, and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not exceed 300 mg. For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than 90 minutes.
 The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and non - obstetrical patients is 200 mg total.
 One half of the total dose is usually administered to each side.
 For intravenous regional anesthesia, the dose administered should not exceed 4mg / kg in adults.
 For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs the dose of lidocaine HCl should not exceed 75 – 100 mg (1.5 to 2 mg / lb).
 The use of even more dilute solutions (ie, 0.25 to 0.5%) and total dosages not to exceed 3 mg / kg (1.4 mg / lb) are recommended for induction of intravenous regional anesthesia in children.
 Dosage forms listed as Xylocaine (lidocaine) - MPF indicate single dose solutions that are Methyl Paraben Free (MPF).
 In oral infiltration and / or mandibular block, initial dosages of 1.0 - 5.0 mL (½to 2½cartridges) of 2% Xylocaine DENTAL (lidocaine HCl 2% solutions with a 1:50,000 or a 1:100,000 epinephrine concentration) are usually effective.
 In children under 10 years of age, it is rarely necessary to administer more than one - half cartridge (0.9 - 1.0 mL or 18 - 20 mg of lidocaine) per procedure to achieve local anesthesia for a procedure involving a single tooth.
 In maxillary infiltration, this amount will often suffice to the treatment of two or even three teeth.
 Maximum recommended dosages for 2% Xylocaine DENTAL (lidocaine HCl 2% solutions with a 1:50,000 or a 1:100,000 epinephrine concentration).
 For normal healthy adults, the amount of lidocaine HCl administered should be kept below 500 mg, and in any case, should not exceed 7 mg / kg (3.2 mg / lb) of body weight.
 For example, in pediatric patients of five years weighing 50 Ibs, the dose of lidocaine hydrochloride should not exceed 75 - 100mg when calculated according to Clark's rule.
 In any case, the maximum dose of lidocaine hydrochloride should not exceed 7 mg / kg (3.2 mg / lb) of body weight.
 RETROBULBAR INJECTION: The suggested dose for a 70 kg person is 3 - 5 mL (120200 mg of lidocaine HCl), ie, 1.7 - 3 mg / kg or 0.9 - 1.5 mg / lb body weight.
 For the combination of the injection and spray, it should rarely be necessary to utilize more than 5 mL (200 mg of lidocaine HCl), ie, 3 mg / kg or 1.5 mg / lb body weight.
 TOPICAL APPLICATION: For laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and endotracheal intubation, the pharynx may be sprayed with 1 - 5 mL (40 - 200 mg of lidocaine HCl), ie, 0.6 - 3 mg / kg or 0.3 - 1.5 mg / lb body weight.
 Normal Healthy Adults: The maximum recommended dose of 4% Xylocaine - MPF Sterile Solution should be such that the dose of lidocaine HCl is kept below 300 mg and in any case should not exceed 4.5 mg / kg (2 mg / lb) body weight.
 For example, in a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine hydrochloride should not exceed 75 - 100 mg when calculated according to Clark's rule.
 In any case, the maximum dose of Xylocaine Solution with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg / kg (3.2 mg / lb) of body weight.
 When used without epinephrine, the amount of Xylocaine Solution administered should be such that the dose of lidocaine is kept below 300 mg and in any case should not exceed 4.5 mg / kg (2 mg / lb) of body weight.
 The maximum recommended single dose of Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 2% Viscous Solution for healthy adults should be such that the dose of lidocaine HCl does not exceed 4.5 mg / kg or 2 mg / lb body weight and does not in any case exceed a total of 300 mg.
 For symptomatic treatment of irritated or inflamed mucous membranes of the mouth and pharynx, the usual adult dose is one 15 mL tablespoonful undiluted.
 For example: in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine hydrochloride should not exceed 75 to 100 mg (3.7 to 5 mL of Xylocaine 2% Viscous Solution).
 For infants and in children under 3 years of age, the solution should be accurately measured and no more than 1.2 mL be applied to the immediate area with a cotton - tipped applicator.
 Xylocaine 2% Viscous Solution should only be used if the underlying condition requires treatment with a volume of product that is less than or equal to 1.2 mL.
 Dosage (International Units) = body weight (kg) × desired factor VIII rise (IU / dL or % of normal) × 0.5 (IU / kg per IU / dL)
 IU / dL (or % normal) = Total Dose (IU) / body weight (kg) × 2 [IU / dL] / [IU / kg]

 The recommended starting dose is 4.5 grams (g) per night administered orally in two equal, divided doses: 2.25 g at bedtime and 2.25 g taken 2.5 to 4 hours later (see Table 1).
 Increase the dose by 1.5 g per night at weekly intervals (additional 0.75 g at bedtime and 0.75 g taken 2.5 to 4 hours later) to the effective dose range of 6 g to 9 g per night orally.
 Doses higher than 9 g per night have not been studied and should not ordinarily be administered.
 Prior to ingestion, each dose of Xyrem should be diluted with approximately ¼ cup (approximately 60 mL) of water in the empty pharmacy vials provided.
 Patients should remain in bed following ingestion of the first and second doses, and should not take the second dose until 2.5 to 4 hours after the first dose.
 The recommended starting dose in patients with hepatic impairment is 2.25 g per night administered orally in two equal, divided doses: approximately 1.13 g at bedtime and approximately 1.13 g taken 2.5 to 4 hours later [see Use In Specific Populations; CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 XYZAL is available as 2.5 mg / 5 mL (0.5 mg / mL) oral solution and as 5 mg breakable (scored) tablets, allowing for the administration of 2.5 mg, if needed.
 The recommended dose of XYZAL is 5 mg (1 tablet or 2 teaspoons [10 mL] oral solution) once daily in the evening.
 Some patients may be adequately controlled by 2.5 mg (½ tablet or 1 teaspoon [5 mL] oral solution) once daily in the evening.
 The recommended dose of XYZAL is 2.5 mg (½ tablet or 1 teaspoon [5 mL] oral solution) once daily in the evening.
 The 2.5 mg dose should not be exceeded because the systemic exposure with 5 mg is approximately twice that of adults [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended initial dose of XYZAL is 1.25 mg (½ teaspoon oral solution) [2.5mL] once daily in the evening.
 The 1.25 mg once daily dose should not be exceeded based on comparable exposure to adults receiving 5 mg [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day.
 During the first cycle of Yasmin use, instruct the patient to take one yellow Yasmin daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle.
 She should take one yellow Yasmin daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28.
 During the first cycle of Yasmin use, instruct the patient to take one yellow Yasmin daily, beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period.
 She should take one yellow Yasmin daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28.
 If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.
 If the patient misses one or more white tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of yellow tablets on the proper day.
 If vomiting occurs within 3 - 4 hours after tablet - taking, this can be regarded as a missed tablet.
 Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day.
 During the first cycle of Yaz use, instruct the patient to take one light pink Yaz daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle.
 She should take one light pink Yaz daily for 24 consecutive days, followed by one white inert tablet daily on Days 25 through 28.

 The recommended dose is 1.5 mg / m² administered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours through a central venous line every 21 days (3 weeks), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, in patients with normal bilirubin and AST or ALT less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.
 The recommended dose is 0.9 mg / m² in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin levels 1.5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal, and AST and ALT less than 8 times the upper limit of normal).
 Administer dexamethasone 20 mg intravenously 30 minutes prior to each dose of YONDELIS.
 It should be reconstituted with 1.0 ml of the diluent provided, which consists of 1.0 ml Sterile Water for Injection, immediately prior to use.
 The recommend - ed dose of ZADAXIN (thymalfasin) for chronic hepatitis B when used as a monotherapy or in combination with interferon (at the labeled dose and schedule for interferon) is 1.6 mg (900 µg / m2) administered subcutaneously twice a week for 6 to 12 months.
 Patients weighing less than 40 kg should receive a ZADAXIN (thymalfasin) dose of 40 µg / kg.
 The recommended dose of ZADAXIN (thymalfasin) for cancer is 1.6 mg (900 µg / m2) administered subcuta neous - ly using various schedules for 6 months or given between chemotherapy cycles for the duration of treat - ment.
 Adults and children 3 years of age and older: Put 1 drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily, every 8 - 12 hours, no more than twice per day.
 The recommended daily dose of Zagam (sparfloxacin) in patients with normal renal function is two 200 - mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose.
 Thereafter, one 200 - mg tablet should be taken every 24 hours for a total of 10 days of therapy (11 tablets).
 The recommended daily dose of Zagam (sparfloxacin) in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min) is two 200 - mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose.
 Thereafter, one 200 - mg tablet should be taken every 48 hours for a total of 9 days of therapy (6 tablets).
 Administer ZALTRAP 4 mg per kg as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour every two weeks.
 Administer ZALTRAP using an infusion set made of one of the following materials:
 The usual adult dosage is one tablespoonful (15 mL) every four to six hours as needed for pain.
 These dosages correspond to an average individual dose of 0.20 mL / kg of Zamicet® (providing 0.135 mg / kg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 4.38 mg / kg of acetaminophen).
 The total daily dosage for children should not exceed 6 doses per day.
 The recommended starting dose is 2 mg. Because the effect of Zanaflex peaks at approximately 1 to 2 hours post - dose and dissipates between 3 to 6 hours post - dose, treatment can be repeated at 6 to 8 hour intervals, as needed, to a maximum of three doses in 24 hours.
 Dosage can be gradually increased by 2 mg to 4 mg at each dose, with 1 to 4 days between dosage increases, until a satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved.
 The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg.
 Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied.
 Zanaflex should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL / min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%.
 Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected.
 If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence].
 The recommended dose for daily intravenous administration is 500 mg / m² of body surface area for five consecutive days every six weeks until maximum benefit or until treatment - limiting toxicity is observed.
 The recommended initial dose for weekly intravenous administration is 1000 mg / m² of body surface area at weekly intervals for the first two courses (weeks).
 However, A SINGLE DOSE OF 1500 mg / m² BODY SURFACE AREA SHOULD NOT BE EXCEEDED as a greater dose may cause azotemia.
 The median total dose to onset of response is about 2000 mg / m² body surface area and the median total dose to maximum response is about 4000 mg / m² body surface area.
 Reconstitute ZANOSAR with 9.5 mL of dextrose injection, USP, or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP.
 The resulting pale - gold solution will contain 100 mg of streptozocin and 22 mg of citric acid per mL.
 50 mg (2 mL) every 6 to 8 hours.
 ZANTAC Injection (ranitidine hydrochloride injection) Premixed solution, 50 mg, in 0.45% sodium chloride, 50 mL, requires no dilution and should be infused over 15 to 20 minutes.
 When this is necessary, the increases should be made by more frequent administration of the dose, but generally should not exceed 400 mg / day.
 Deliver at a rate of 6.25 mg / hour (e.g., 150 mg [6 mL] of ZANTAC Injection (ranitidine hydrochloride injection) in 250 mL of 5% dextrose injection at 10.7 mL / hour).
 For Zollinger - Ellison patients, dilute ZANTAC Injection (ranitidine hydrochloride injection) in 5% dextrose injection or other compatible IV solution (see Stability) to a concentration no greater than 2.5 mg / mL.
 If after 4 hours either a measured gastric acid output is > 10 mEq / hour or the patient becomes symptomatic, the dose should be adjusted upward in 0.5 - mg / kg / hour increments, and the acid output should be remeasured.
 While limited data exist on the administration of IV ranitidine to children, the recommended dose in pediatric patients is for a total daily dose of 2 to 4 mg / kg, to be divided and administered every 6 to 8 hours, up to a maximum of 50 mg given every 6 to 8 hours.
 Limited data in neonatal patients (less than 1 month of age) receiving ECMO have shown that a dose of 2 mg / kg is usually sufficient to increase gastric pH to > 4 for at least 15 hours.
 Therefore, doses of 2 mg / kg given every 12 to 24 hours or as a continuous infusion should be considered.
 On the basis of experience with a group of subjects with severely impaired renal function treated with ZANTAC, the recommended dosage in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min is 50 mg every 18 to 24 hours.
 The initial dose for patients 3 to 6 years of age is one capsule (250 mg) per day; for patients 6 years of age and older, 2 capsules (500 mg) per day.
 One useful method is to increase the daily dose by 250 mg every four to seven days until control is achieved with minimal side effects.
 Dosages exceeding 1.5 g daily, in divided doses, should be administered only under the strictest supervision of the physician.
 The optimal dose for most pediatric patients is 20 mg / kg / day.
 This dose has given average plasma levels within the accepted therapeutic range of 40 to 100 mcg / mL.
 The optimal dose for most pediatric patients is 20 mg / kg / day.
 The initial dose for patients 3 to 6 years of age is one teaspoonful (250 mg) per day; for patients 6 years of age and older, 2 teaspoonfuls (500 mg) per day.
 One useful method is to increase the daily dose by 250 mg every four to seven days until control is achieved with minimal side effects.
 Dosages exceeding 1.5 g daily, in divided doses, should be administered only under the strictest supervision of the physician.
 The optimal dose for most pediatric patients is 20 mg / kg / day.
 This dose has given average plasma levels within the accepted therapeutic range of 40 to 100 mcg / mL.
 The optimal dose for most pediatric patients is 20 mg / kg / day.
 The recommended starting dosage of ZARXIO is 5 mcg / kg / day‚ administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection‚ by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes)‚ or by continuous intravenous infusion.
 Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg / kg for each chemotherapy cycle‚ according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir.
 The recommended dosage of ZARXIO following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg / kg / day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours.
 The recommended dosage of ZARXIO for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg / kg / day given by subcutaneous injection.
 The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg / kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg / kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection.
 In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of filgrastim were: 6 mcg / kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg / kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg / kg (idiopathic neutropenia).
 In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of filgrastim greater than or equal to 100 mcg / kg / day.
 ZARXIO prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive® Needle Guard is not designed to allow for direct administration of doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg).
 The spring - mechanism of the needle guard apparatus affixed to the prefilled syringe interferes with the visibility of the graduation markings on the syringe barrel corresponding to 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL.
 The visibility of these markings is necessary to accurately measure doses of ZARXIO less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) for direct administration to patients.
 Thus, the direct administration to patients requiring doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors.
 If required for intravenous administration, ZARXIO may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to concentrations between 5 mcg / mL and 15 mcg / mL.
 ZARXIO diluted to concentrations from 5 mcg / mL to 15 mcg / mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg / mL.
 The recommended dose for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease is one 100 mg capsule administered orally three times a day at regular intervals.
 It may be necessary to reduce the dose to one 100 mg capsule once or twice a day in some patients due to adverse reactions, such as tremor or diarrhea.
 In patients with mild renal impairment (adjusted creatinine clearance 50 - 70 mL / min / 1.73 m²), Zavesca administration should commence at a dose of 100 mg twice per day.
 In patients with moderate renal impairment (adjusted creatinine clearance of 30 - 50 mL / min / 1.73 m²), Zavesca administration should commence at a dose of one 100 mg capsule per day.
 The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily.
 In some patients, 2.5 mg may be an appropriate starting dose (see Bronchospastic Disease in WARNINGS).
 If the antihypertensive effect of 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily.
 In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL / min), the initial daily dose should be 2.5 mg and caution should be used in dose - titration.
 The maximum recommended single dose is one ZECUITY iontophoretic transdermal system (TDS).
 ZECUITY delivers 6.5 mg of sumatriptan over 4 hours.
 ZEGERID (omeprazole / sodium bicarbonate) is available as a capsule and as a powder for oral suspension in 20 mg and 40 mg strengths of omeprazole for adult use.
 Since both the 20 mg and 40 mg oral suspension packets contain the same amount of sodium bicarbonate (1680 mg), two packets of 20 mg are not equivalent to one packet of ZEGERID 40 mg; therefore, two 20 mg packets of ZEGERID should not be substituted for one packet of ZEGERID 40 mg.
 Since both the 20 mg and 40 mg capsules contain the same amount of sodium bicarbonate (1100 mg), two capsules of 20 mg are not equivalent to one capsule of ZEGERID 40 mg; therefore, two 20 mg capsules of ZEGERID should not be substituted for one capsule of ZEGERID 40 mg.
 If ZEGERID is to be administered through a nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube, the suspension should be constituted with approximately 20 mL of water.
 The suspension should be washed through the tube with 20 mL of water.
 Initiate treatment with 1.25 mg given once a day for at least 6 weeks.
 After 6 weeks, the dose may be increased to 2.5 mg given once a day if a desired benefit has not been achieved and the patient is tolerating ZELAPAR.
 There is no evidence that doses greater than 2.5 mg a day provide additional benefit, and they should ordinarily be avoided because of the potential increased risk of adverse events.
 Patients should PEEL BACK the backing of one or two blisters (as prescribed) with dry hands, and GENTLY remove the tablet(s).
 In patients with mild to moderate hepatic disease (Child - Pugh score 5 to 9), the daily dose of ZELAPAR should be reduced (from 2.5 to 1.25 mg daily), depending on the clinical response.
 No dose adjustment of ZELAPAR is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 89 mL / min).
 The maintenance dose of ZELAPAR (1.25 mg or 2.5 mg) is determined by the individual clinical response.
 ZELAPAR is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with end - stage renal disease [ESRD] (creatinine clearance [CLcr] < 30 mL / min) [see Use In Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of ZELBORAF is 960 mg (four 240 mg tablets) orally every 12 hours with or without a meal.
 Withhold ZELBORAF for NCI - CTCAE (v4.0) intolerable Grade 2 or greater adverse reactions.
 Do not dose reduce to below 480 mg twice daily.
 The recommended dosage of Zelnorm® (tegaserod maleate) is 6 mg taken twice daily orally before meals for 4 to 6 weeks.
 The recommended dosage of Zelnorm (tegaserod maleate) is 6 mg taken twice daily orally before meals.
 The recommended dose of Zemaira is 60 mg / kg body weight administered once weekly.

 The recommended dose of ZEMBRACE SymTouch is 3 mg injected subcutaneously.
 The maximum cumulative injected dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, with doses of ZEMBRACE SymTouch separated by at least 1 hour.
 ZEMBRACE SymTouch is available as a prefilled, ready - to - use, single dose, disposable auto - injector containing 3 mg sumatriptan.
 With ZEMBRACE SymTouch, the needle penetrates approximately ¼ inch (6 mm).
 The recommended initial dose of Zemplar is 0.04 mcg / kg to 0.1 mcg / kg (2.8 – 7 mcg) administered as a bolus dose no more frequently than every other day at any time during dialysis.
 If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 2 to 4 mcg at 2 - to 4 - week intervals.
 Table 1: Recommended ZEMPLAR Starting Dose Based upon Baseline iPTH Level
 If a patient is taking the lowest dose, 1 mcg, on the daily regimen and a dose reduction is needed, the dose can be decreased to 1 mcg three times a week.
 Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg / mL) divided by 80
 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg / dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and Clinical Studies].
 Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg / ml) divided by 80
 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms.
 Administer ZEMPLAR 1 mcg capsule orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day.
 Dose* (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg / mL) divided by 120
 The recommended initial dose of ZEMURON, regardless of anesthetic technique, is 0.6 mg / kg.
 A lower dose of ZEMURON (0.45 mg / kg) may be used.
 This dose may be expected to provide 22 (12 - 31) minutes of clinical relaxation under opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia.
 Patients receiving this low dose of 0.45 mg / kg who achieve less than 90% block (about 16% of these patients) may have a more rapid time to 25% recovery, 12 to 15 minutes.
 A large bolus dose of 0.9 or 1.2 mg / kg can be administered under opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia without adverse effects to the cardiovascular system [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 In appropriately premedicated and adequately anesthetized patients, ZEMURON 0.6 to 1.2 mg / kg will provide excellent or good intubating conditions in most patients in less than 2 minutes [see Clinical Studies].
 Maintenance doses of 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg / kg ZEMURON, administered at 25% recovery of control T1 (defined as 3 twitches of train - of - four), provide a median (range) of 12 (2 - 31), 17 (6 - 50), and 24 (7 - 69) minutes of clinical duration under opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Infusion at an initial rate of 10 to 12 mcg / kg / min of ZEMURON should be initiated only after early evidence of spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose.
 In clinical trials, infusion rates have ranged from 4 to 16 mcg / kg / min.
 In the presence of steady - state concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane, it may be necessary to reduce the rate of infusion by 30% to 50%, at 45 to 60 minutes after the intubating dose.
 Table 1: Infusion Rates Using ZEMURON Injection (0.5 mg / mL)*
 Table 2: Infusion Rates Using ZEMURON Injection (1 mg / mL)*
 Table 3: Infusion Rates Using ZEMURON Injection (5 mg / mL)*
 The recommended initial intubation dose of ZEMURON is 0.6 mg / kg; however, a lower dose of 0.45 mg / kg may be used depending on anesthetic technique and the age of the patient.
 For sevoflurane (induction) ZEMURON doses of 0.45 mg / kg and 0.6 mg / kg in general produce excellent to good intubating conditions within 75 seconds.
 When halothane is used, a 0.6 mg / kg dose of ZEMURON resulted in excellent to good intubating conditions within 60 seconds.
 When sevoflurane is used for induction and isoflurane / nitrous oxide for maintenance of general anesthesia, maintenance dosing of ZEMURON can be administered as bolus doses of 0.15 mg / kg at reappearance of T3 in all pediatric age groups.
 When halothane is used for general anesthesia, patients ranging from 3 months old through adolescence can be administered ZEMURON maintenance doses of 0.075 to 0.125 mg / kg upon return of T1 to 0.25% to provide clinical relaxation for 7 to 10 minutes.
 Alternatively, a continuous infusion of ZEMURON initiated at a rate of 12 mcg / kg / min upon return of T1 to 10% (one twitch present in train - of - four) may also be used to maintain neuromuscular blockade in pediatric patients.
 Spontaneous recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation of ZEMURON infusion may be expected to proceed at rates comparable to that following similar total exposure to single bolus doses [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Geriatric patients (65 years or older) exhibited a slightly prolonged median (range) clinical duration of 46 (22 - 73), 62 (49 - 75), and 94 (64 - 138) minutes under opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen anesthesia following doses of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mg / kg, respectively.
 No differences from patients with normal hepatic and kidney function were observed for onset time at a dose of 0.6 mg / kg ZEMURON.
 In obese patients, the initial dose of ZEMURON 0.6 mg / kg should be based upon the patient's actual body weight [see Clinical Studies].
 The median clinical duration of a dose of 0.57 to 0.85 mg / kg was 34, 38, and 42 minutes under opioid / nitrous oxide / oxygen, enflurane and isoflurane maintenance anesthesia, respectively.
 ZEMURON is compatible in the above solutions at concentrations up to 5 mg / mL for 24 hours at room temperature in plastic bags, glass bottles, and plastic syringe pumps.
 The recommended dose for ZENAPAX (daclizumab) in adult and pediatric patients is 1.0 mg / kg (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).
 The calculated volume of ZENAPAX (daclizumab) should be mixed with 50 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution and administered via a peripheral or central vein over a 15 - minute period.
 Based on the clinical trials, the standard course of ZENAPAX (daclizumab) therapy is five doses.
 The recommended dosage range for Zenatane is 0.5 to 1 mg / kg / day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks.
 In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg / kg / day8, it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages.
 Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg / kg / day, as tolerated.
 One tablet daily or as directed by physician.
 Dosage recommendations for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy were published following the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Consensus Conferences.1,2,3 ZENPEP should be administered in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the Conferences provided in the following paragraphs, with one exception.
 The Conferences recommend doses of 2,000 to 4,000 lipase units in infants up to 12 months.
 ZENPEP is available in a 3,000 lipase unit capsule.
 The recommended dose of ZENPEP in infants up to 12 months is 3,000 lipase units.
 Infants may be given 3,000 lipase units (one capsule) per 120 mL of formula or breast - feeding.
 Enzyme dosing should begin with 1,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal for children less than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day.
 Enzyme dosing should begin with 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal for those older than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day.
 The total daily dose should reflect approximately three meals plus two or three snacks per day.
 If doses are to exceed 2,500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal, further investigation is warranted.
 Patients currently receiving higher doses than 6,000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal should be examined and the dosage either immediately decreased or titrated downward to a lower range.
 ZENPEP should be administered to infants immediately prior to each feeding, using a dosage of 3,000 lipase units (one capsule) per 120 mL of formula or per breast - feeding.
 Contents of the capsule may be administered with a small amount of applesauce, or other acidic food with a pH of 4.5 or less (e.g., commercially available preparations of bananas, or pears).
 Usual dose is 5 to 60 mg per day in divided doses, depending on the individual patient response.
 The suggested initial dose for patients aged 6 to 12 is 5 mg daily; daily dose may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained.
 In patients 12 years of age and older, start with 10 mg daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 10 mg at weekly intervals until an optimal response is obtained.
 Give first dose on awakening; additional doses (1 or 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.
 In pediatric patients 3 to 5 years of age, start with 2.5 mg daily, by tablet; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 2.5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained.
 In pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, start with 5 mg once or twice daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained.
 Only in rare cases will it be necessary to exceed a total of 40 mg per day.
 Give first dose on awakening; additional doses (1 or 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.
 In subjects receiving ZEPATIER for 12 weeks, sustained virologic response (SVR12) rates were lower in genotype 1a - infected patients with one or more baseline NS5A resistance - associated polymorphisms at amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 [see Microbiology], Table 11.
 ZEPATIER is a two - drug, fixed - dose combination product containing 50 mg of elbasvir and 100 mg of grazoprevir in a single tablet.
 The recommended dosage of ZEPATIER is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 When administered with ZEPATIER, the recommended dosage of ribavirin in patients without renal impairment is weight - based administered in two divided doses with food.
 Table 1: Recommended Dosage Regimens and Durations for ZEPATIER for Treatment of HCV Genotype 1 or 4 in Patients with or without Cirrhosis
 Refer to the ribavirin tablet prescribing information for the correct ribavirin dosage for patients with CrCl less than or equal to 50 mL per minute.
 The recommended dosage regimen is ZERBAXA 1.5 gram (g) (ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 0.5 g) for injection administered every 8 hours by intravenous infusion over 1 hour in patients 18 years or older and with normal renal function or mild renal impairment.
 Table 1: Dosage of ZERBAXA 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 0.5 g) by Infection in Patients with Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) Greater than 50 mL / min
 Dose adjustment is required for patients whose creatinine clearance is 50 mL / min or less.
 Constitute the vial with 10 mL of sterile water for injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP and gently shake to dissolve.
 Add the withdrawn volume to an infusion bag containing 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.
 Following dilution of the solution with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose, ZERBAXA is stable for 24 hours when stored at room temperature or 7 days when stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).
 Prior to dispensing, the pharmacist must constitute the dry powder with purified water to a concentration of 1 mg stavudine per mL of solution, as follows:
 Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 10 - 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 - 50 mg per day.
 In clinical trials of lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 - 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 - 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component.
 A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril / HCTZ 10 / 12.5 or lisinopril / HCTZ 20 / 12.5, depending on current monotherapy dose.
 Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen may achieve similar or greater blood - pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to lisinopril / HCTZ 10 / 12.5.
 If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg of lisinopril should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS).
 Regimens of therapy with lisinopril / HCTZ need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL / min / 1.7m² (serum creatinine roughly ≤ 3 mg / dL or 265 μmol / L).
 Initial Therapy in adults: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day.
 The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose.
 Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect.
 If blood pressure is not controlled with Zestril alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg).
 The recommended starting dose in adult patients with hypertension taking diuretics is 5 mg once per day.
 For pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL / min / 1.73m², the recommended starting dose is 0.07 mg per kg once daily (up to 5 mg total).
 Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response up to a maximum of 0.61 mg per kg (up to 40 mg) once daily.
 Doses above 0.61 mg per kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Zestril is not recommended in pediatric patients < 6 years or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL / min / 1.73m² [see Use in Specific Populations and Clinical Studies].
 The recommended starting dose for Zestril, when used with diuretics and (usually) digitalis as adjunctive therapy for systolic heart failure, is 5 mg once daily.
 The recommended starting dose in these patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq / L) is 2.5 mg once daily.
 Increase as tolerated to a maximum of 40 mg once daily.
 In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, give Zestril 5 mg orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg once daily.
 Initiate therapy with 2.5 mg in patients with a low systolic blood pressure ( ≤ 120 mmHg and > 100 mmHg) during the first 3 days after the infarct [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 If hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg) a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given with temporary reductions to 2.5 mg if needed.
 If prolonged hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) Zestril should be withdrawn.
 No dose adjustment of Zestril is required in patients with creatinine clearance > 30 mL / min.
 In patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 10 mL / min and ≤ 30 mL / min, reduce the initial dose of Zestril to half of the usual recommended dose i.e., hypertension, 5 mg; systolic heart failure, 2.5 mg and acute MI, 2.5 mg. Up titrate as tolerated to a maximum of 40 mg daily.
 For patients on hemodialysis or creatinine clearance < 10 mL / min, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 The recommended dose of ZETIA is 10 mg once daily.
 When given with simvastatin in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL / min / 1.73 m²), doses of simvastatin exceeding 20 mg should be used with caution and close monitoring [see Use in Specific Populations].
 Adults and Adolescents (12 Years of Age and Older): The recommended dose of ZETONNA is 1 actuation per nostril once daily (37 mcg per actuation).
 The maximum total daily dosage should not exceed 1 actuation in each nostril (74 mcg per day).
 Absorbed dose estimates for the lower large intestine, upper large intestine, and small intestine have been modified from the standard MIRDOSE 3 output to account for the assumption that activity is within the intestine wall rather than the intestine contents.
 Bisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg.
 In clinical trials of bisoprolol / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.
 A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5 - 20 mg bisoprolol daily may instead be given ZIAC.
 Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to ZIAC.
 Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of ZIAC, one 2.5 / 6.25 mg tablet once daily.
 Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with ZIAC tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20 / 12.5 mg (two 10 / 6.25 mg tablets) once daily, as appropriate.
 The recommended dosage of ZIAGEN for adults is 600 mg daily, administered orally as either 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
 The recommended dosage of ZIAGEN oral solution in HIV - 1 - infected pediatric patients aged 3 months and older is 8 mg per kg orally twice daily or 16 mg per kg orally once - daily (up to a maximum of 600 mg daily) in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
 ZIAGEN is also available as a scored tablet for HIV - 1 - infected pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 14 kg for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate.
 The recommended dose of ZIAGEN in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class A) is 200 mg twice daily.
 To enable dose reduction, ZIAGEN oral solution (10 mL twice daily) should be used for the treatment of these patients.

 The usual adult dosage range for ZINACEF is 750 mg to 1.5 grams every 8 hours, usually for 5 to 10 days.
 In life - threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, 1.5 grams every 6 hours may be required.
 In bacterial meningitis, the dosage should not exceed 3 grams every 8 hours.
 The recommended dosage for uncomplicated gonococcal infection is 1.5 grams given intramuscularly as a single dose at 2 different sites together with 1 gram of oral probenecid.
 Thereafter, give 750 mg intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 hours when the procedure is prolonged.
 For preventive use during open heart surgery, a 1.5 - gram dose administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia and every 12 hours thereafter for a total of 6 grams is recommended.
 Administration of 50 to 100 mg / kg / day in equally divided doses every 6 to 8 hours has been successful for most infections susceptible to cefuroxime.
 The higher dosage of 100 mg / kg / day (not to exceed the maximum adult dosage) should be used for the more severe or serious infections.
 In bone and joint infections, 150 mg / kg / day (not to exceed the maximum adult dosage) is recommended in equally divided doses every 8 hours.
 In cases of bacterial meningitis, a larger dosage of ZINACEF is recommended, 200 to 240 mg / kg / day intravenously in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours.
 Each 750 - mg vial of ZINACEF should be constituted with 3.0 mL of Sterile Water for Injection.
 Each 750 - mg vial should be constituted with 8.3 mL of Sterile Water for Injection.
 Each 1.5 - gram vial should be constituted with 16.0 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, and the solution should be completely withdrawn for injection.
 The 7.5 - gram pharmacy bulk vial should be constituted with 77 mL of Sterile Water for Injection; each 8 mL of the resulting solution contains 750 mg of cefuroxime.
 However, during infusion of the solution containing ZINACEF, it is advisable to temporarily discontinue administration of any other solutions at the same site.

 single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7 - day course of therapy.
 The infusate concentration and rate of infusion for ZITHROMAX for injection should be either 1 mg / mL over 3 hr or 2 mg / mL over 1 hr.
 Prepare the initial solution of ZITHROMAX for injection by adding 4.8 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to the 500 mg vial, and shaking the vial until all of the drug is dissolved.
 Since ZITHROMAX for injection is supplied under vacuum, it is recommended that a standard 5 mL (non - automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount of 4.8 mL of Sterile Water is dispensed.
 Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 100 mg azithromycin.
 To provide azithromycin over a concentration range of 1.0 - 2.0 mg / mL, transfer 5 mL of the 100 mg / mL azithromycin solution into the appropriate amount of any of the diluents listed below:
 When diluted according to the instructions (1.0 mg / mL to 2.0 mg / mL), ZITHROMAX for injection is stable for 24 hr at or below room temperature 30°C (86°F), or for 7 days if stored under refrigeration 5°C (41°F).
 Zmax should be taken as a single 2 g dose.
 Zmax provides a full course of antibacterial therapy in a single oral dose.
 For pediatric patients 6 months and older, Zmax should be taken as a single dose of 60 mg / kg (equivalent to 27 mg / lb) body weight.
 The Zmax dose in mL is equivalent to the child's weight in lb (1 mL / lb dose, see Table 1 below), for a body weight of less than 75 lb (34 kg).
 Pediatric patients weighing 75 lb (34 kg) or more should receive the adult dose (2 g).
 Since insufficient data exist on absorption of azithromycin if a patient vomits between 5 and 60 minutes following administration, alternative therapy should be considered.

 The recommended usual starting dose is 10 mg once a day in the evening.
 The recommended dosing range is 10 to 40 mg / day; the maximum recommended dose is 40 mg / day.
 However, caution should be exercised when ZOCOR is administered to patients with severe renal impairment; such patients should be started at 5 mg / day and be closely monitored [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Because of an increased risk for myopathy in Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 g / day niacin) of niacin - containing products, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg / day coadministered with lipid - modifying doses of niacin - containing products.
 Because the risk for myopathy is dose - related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid - modifying doses of niacin - containing products.

 In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh score of 10 or greater), clearance is reduced and apparent volume of distribution is increased with a resultant increase in plasma half - life.
 In such patients, a total daily dose of 8 mg should not be exceeded.
 ZOFRAN Injection should be diluted in 50 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection before administration.
 The recommended adult intravenous dosage of ZOFRAN is three 0.15 - mg / kg doses up to a maximum of 16 mg per dose [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Subsequent doses (0.15 mg / kg up to a maximum of 16 mg per dose) are administered 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ZOFRAN.
 For pediatric patients aged 6 months through 18 years, the intravenous dosage of ZOFRAN is three 0.15 - mg / kg doses up to a maximum of 16 mg per dose [see Clinical Studies, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 Subsequent doses (0.15 mg / kg up to a maximum of 16 mg per dose) are administered 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ZOFRAN.
 The recommended adult intravenous dosage of ZOFRAN is 4 mg undiluted administered intravenously in not less than 30 seconds, preferably over 2 to 5 minutes, immediately before induction of anesthesia, or postoperatively if the patient did not receive prophylactic antiemetics and experiences nausea and / or vomiting occurring within 2 hours after surgery.
 Alternatively, 4 mg undiluted may be administered intramuscularly as a single injection for adults.
 In patients who do not achieve adequate control of postoperative nausea and vomiting following a single, prophylactic, preinduction, intravenous dose of ondansetron 4 mg, administration of a second intravenous dose of 4 mg ondansetron postoperatively does not provide additional control of nausea and vomiting.
 For pediatric patients aged 1 month through 12 years, the dosage is a single 0.1 - mg / kg dose for patients weighing 40 kg or less, or a single 4 - mg dose for patients weighing more than 40 kg.
 In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh score of 10 or greater), a single maximal daily dose of 8 mg infused over 15 minutes beginning 30 minutes before the start of the emetogenic chemotherapy is recommended.
 Daily doses of ZOHYDRO ER, a single dose of greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose of greater than 80 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established.
 Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
 Initiate therapy with ZOHYDRO ER with one 10 mg capsule every 12 hours.
 The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is ZOHYDRO ER 10 mg orally every 12 hours.
 To obtain the initial ZOHDYRO ER dose, first use Table 1 to convert the prior oral opioids to a total hydrocodone daily dose and then reduce the calculated daily hydrocodone dose by 25% to account for interpatient variability in relative potency of different opioids.
 Example conversion from a single opioid to ZOHYDRO ER
 Step 1: Sum the total daily dose of the opioid (in this case, extended - release oxymorphone); 15 mg oxymorphone twice daily = 30 mg total daily dose of oxymorphone.
 Step 2: Calculate the approximate equivalent dose of oral hydrocodone based on the total daily dose of the current opioid using Table 1; 30 mg total daily dose of oxymorphone x 2 = 60 mg of oral hydrocodone daily.
 Step 3: Calculate the approximate starting dose which is 30 mg ZOHYDRO ER every 12 hours.
 The dose of ZOHYDRO ER can be gradually adjusted preferably at increments of 10 mg every 12 hours every 3 to 7 days, until adequate pain relief and acceptable adverse reactions have been achieved.
 Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative hydrocodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of ZOHYDRO ER, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcg / hr fentanyl transdermal patch.
 Because steady - state plasma concentrations are approximated within 3 days, ZOHYDRO ER dosage adjustments, preferably at increments of 10 mg every 12 hours, may be done every 3 to 7 days.
 Therefore, initiate therapy with 10 mg every 12 hours and titrate carefully, while monitoring for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.
 Doses above 100 mg every 12 hours (q12h) were not studied in the Phase 3 trial.
 For patients exceeding 100 mg q12h use a gradual downward titration of the dose every 2 to 4 days.

 The recommended dose is 400 mg orally once daily with food.
 If a patient is intolerant to therapy, the dose may be reduced to 300 mg orally once daily with food.
 The dose may be further reduced to 300 mg once daily with food for 5 consecutive days each week, as necessary.
 Reduce the starting dose to 300 mg orally once daily with food in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin 1 to 3 x ULN or AST > ULN).
 There is insufficient evidence to recommend a starting dose for patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 x ULN).

 The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24 - hour period.
 The recommended dose of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one - half of one 2.5 mg zolmitriptan tablets) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients.
 Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day.
 If zolmitriptan tablets is co - administered with cimetidine, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24 - hour period [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 A dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg per day is the initial therapeutic dosage.
 For adults and pediatric patients, subsequent dosages may be increased in case of an inadequate response in 25 to 50 mg per day increments once a week, depending on tolerability, up to a maximum of 200 mg per day.

 The withdrawn concentrate must be diluted in 100 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.
 Due to the risk of clinically significant deterioration in renal function, which may progress to renal failure, single doses of Zometa should not exceed 4 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].
 In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis, have occurred in patients, including those treated with the approved dose of 4 mg infused over 15 minutes.
 The recommended starting dose of ZOMIG is 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg.
 The 1.25 mg dose can be achieved by manually breaking the functionally - scored 2.5 mg tablet in half.
 The maximum recommended single dose of ZOMIG is 5 mg.
 In controlled clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 2.5 mg or 5 mg dose than following a 1 mg dose.
 There was little added benefit from the 5 mg dose compared to the 2.5 mg dose, but adverse reactions were more frequent with the 5 mg dose.
 The maximum daily dose is 10 mg in any 24 - hour period.
 The recommended dose of ZOMIG in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is 1.25 mg (one - half of one 2.5 mg ZOMIG tablet) because of increased zolmitriptan blood levels in these patients and elevation of blood pressure in some of these patients.
 Limit the total daily dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment to no more than 5 mg per day.

 If necessary to control cough, up to 600 mg daily in three divided doses may be given.
 ZONEGRAN should be administered once or twice daily, using 25 mg or 100 mg capsules.
 Although the regimen described below is one that has been shown to be tolerated, the prescriber may wish to prolong the duration of treatment at the lower doses in order to fully assess the effects of zonisamide at steady state, noting that many of the side effects of zonisamide are more frequent at doses of 300 mg per day and above.
 Although there is some evidence of greater response at doses above 100 – 200 mg / day, the increase appears small and formal dose - response studies have not been conducted.
 The initial dose of ZONEGRAN should be 100 mg daily.
 After two weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg / day for at least two weeks.
 It can be increased to 300 mg / day and 400 mg / day, with the dose stable for at least two weeks to achieve steady state at each level.
 Evidence from controlled trials suggests that ZONEGRAN doses of 100 – 600 mg / day are effective, but there is no suggestion of increasing response above 400 mg / day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies).
 There is little experience with doses greater than 600 mg / day.
 Take one tablet of ZONTIVITY 2.08 mg orally once daily, with or without food.

 Occasionally, after refrigeration, small colorless particles may be present in the Zorbtive® 8.8 mg solution.
 The total daily dose of Zortress should be doubled using the available tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg or 0.75 mg).
 Dose adjustment is also required if the trough concentration is greater than 8 ng / mL on 2 consecutive measures; the dose of ZORTRESS® should be decreased by 0.25 mg twice daily [see Therapeutic DrugMonitoring (TDM) Everolimus, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 An initial Zortress dose of 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg per day) is recommended for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation [see Therapeutic DrugMonitoring (TDM) Everolimus and Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Cyclosporine In Kidney Transplant Patients, Clinical Studies].
 An initial dose of 1.0 mg orally twice daily (2.0 mg per day) is recommended for adult liver transplant patients in combination with reduced dose tacrolimus [see Therapeutic DrugMonitoring (TDM) Everolimus, Therapeutic Drug - Monitoring (TDM) Tacrolimus in Liver Transplant Patients, Clinical Studies].
 The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng / mL [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].
 There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].
 The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng / mL is based on an LC / MS / MS assay method.
 The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with Zortress are 100 to 200 ng / mL through Month 1 posttransplant, 75 to 150 ng / mL at Months 2 and 3 posttransplant, 50 to 100 ng / mL at Month 4 posttransplant, and 25 to 50 ng / mL from Month 6 through Month 12 posttransplant.

 Administer ZOSTAVAX as a single 0.65 - mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the upper arm.
 The usual total daily dose of ZOSYN for adults is 3.375 g every six hours totaling 13.5 g (12.0 g piperacillin / 1.5 g tazobactam).
 Initial presumptive treatment of patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with ZOSYN at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, totaling 18.0 g (16.0 g piperacillin / 2.0 g tazobactam).
 The recommended duration of ZOSYN treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days.
 In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL / min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of ZOSYN should be reduced to the degree of actual renal function impairment.
 For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia.
 Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g ZOSYN (0.67 g piperacillin / 0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days.
 For children with appendicitis and / or peritonitis 9 months of age or older, weighing up to 40 kg, and with normal renal function, the recommended ZOSYN dosage is 100 mg piperacillin / 12.5 mg tazobactam per kilogram of body weight, every 8 hours.

 The recommended dose of ZYTIGA is 1,000 mg (four 250 mg tablets) administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally twice daily.
 In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child - Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of ZYTIGA to 250 mg once daily.
 A once daily dose of 250 mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is predicted to result in an area under the concentration curve (AUC) similar to the AUC seen in patients with normal hepatic function receiving 1,000 mg once daily.
 However, there are no clinical data at the dose of 250 mg once daily in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and caution is advised.
 Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN.
 If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 750 mg once daily, re - treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN.
 If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, discontinue treatment with ZYTIGA.
 Although there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers, because of the potential for an interaction, if a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co - administered, increase the ZYTIGA dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co - administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day).
 Add a total of 123 mL distilled water in two portions.
 After constitution, each 5 mL of the suspension contains 100 mg of linezolid.
