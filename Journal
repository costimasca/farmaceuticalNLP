-generate tsv file with labels given to the sentences from the test set to view where most issues occur

Main issues were regarding:
-the 0 at the end of sentences which is a character format issue that turns '.' into '0'.
-identifiying as 'DOS' numbers that indicate a time period e.g. 'two to three days'
-not identifying 'international units' as 'UNIT'
-not identifying as 'DOS' complex dosages e.g. '30-50mg' -> perhaps splitting numbers from letters would solve this issue
-line 7692
-not identifiying 'mg/l'

Questions:
-how do I treat adjectives that are attached to the UNIT? e.g. 'DAILY dose'?

Conclusion:
-Although there were many false positives and false negatives, a few inconsistencies were indeed detected in the dataset.
-average f1-score increased by 4 percent after this attempt. great!!

TO-DO:
-maybe experiment with different features?
-punctuation should not be classified as DOS or UNIT
-split sentences by '-', '/' and maybe '.' (I saw 2 sentences marked as one)
-create 'contains_dosage(sentence)' function to be able to increase dataset size.

Idea:
	there is a weight parameter that I could set in the labeling process. (maybe set weight for '.' to 0)

-what should the final application do?
-include comparisons on different algorithms?
-research paper?

-1/2 formatted incorrectly
-fixed '.' formatting problem
-'4-8' cataloged as JJ (adjective)
-anywhere there is a formatting problem, it is replaced by '??' and this causes bad classification => remake corpus

-remade corpus; performance improvement from the start.
-issues identifying interval ('1 to 3') dosages
-is 'daily dose' a UNIT?
-started labeling both 'TREZIX' and 'tablet' as UNIT
-something causes labels to be placed one step lower than they should:
    0.9-2.4	JJ	DOS
    grams	NNS	UNIT
    daily	RB	O
    in	IN	O
    3	CD	DOS
    or	CC	O
    4	CD	DOS
    equally	RB	UNIT
    divided	VBN	UNIT
    doses	NNS	UNIT
    (	(	O
    i.e.	JJ	O
    ,	,	O
    300-600	JJ	DOS !!! O
    mg	NN	UNIT !!! DOS
    3	CD	O !!! UNIT
    or	CC	O
    4	CD	O
    times	NNS	O
    daily	RB	O
    )	)	O
    .	.	O

-split "0.15-mg/kg" or "8-mg" by hyphen?
-deleted sentences that were missclassified because of formatiing issues (the one above and one more)
